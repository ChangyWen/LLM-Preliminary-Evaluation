*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: Is Lake Martin, AL located south of Dal-Tex Building, TX? I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to figure out the locations of both places. Lake Martin is in Alabama, and Dal-Tex Building is in Texas. Specifically, Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, Texas, I believe. I should confirm that.

Dal-Tex Building: I recall it's a historic building in Dallas, Texas. It's associated with the JFK assassination, but for this, I just need its location. So, it's in Dallas, TX.

Lake Martin is a lake in Alabama. I think it's in central Alabama.

Now, I need to compare their latitudes to see if one is south of the other. Since the question is about north-south direction, latitude is key.

Let me recall the approximate latitudes:

- Dallas, Texas: I think Dallas is around 32.8°N latitude. I should look for more precise coordinates.

I don't have a database, but I can reason with general knowledge.

Alabama is generally south of Texas? No, that doesn't sound right. Texas is huge, and parts of Texas are further south than Alabama.

Let me think about the southernmost points:

- The southern tip of Texas is at about 26°N, near Brownsville.

- Alabama's southernmost point is around 30°N or so.

But we need specific points: Lake Martin and Dal-Tex Building.

First, Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, TX.

Dallas, TX coordinates: Approximately 32.7767°N, 96.7970°W. I think that's right.

Now, Lake Martin, AL. Lake Martin is not a city; it's a lake. I need a specific point. Probably, the center or a major town nearby.

Lake Martin is in Tallapoosa, Elmore, and Coosa counties in Alabama. A common reference point might be Alexander City, which is near Lake Martin.

Alexander City, AL: Latitude approximately 32.9°N.

I think Alexander City is at about 32.94°N.

But let's confirm.

I should look for the lake itself. But since it's a large lake, I can use a point like the dam or something.

To simplify, I can compare the latitude of Dallas, TX to that of the Lake Martin area.

Dallas, TX latitude: about 32.78°N.

Now, Lake Martin, AL: Let's say the area around it. Alexander City is at 32.94°N, which is north of Dallas? 32.94 is higher than 32.78, so that would mean Alexander City is north of Dallas.

Latitude increases as you go north. So higher latitude means further north.

Dallas: 32.78°N

Alexander City, AL: 32.94°N

Since 32.94 > 32.78, Alexander City is north of Dallas.

But Lake Martin is the lake, and Alexander City is on the north shore, I think.

I need the latitude of Lake Martin itself.

Perhaps I can find a specific point.

Since the lake is large, but for directional purposes, we can use the centroid or a known location.

Let me think differently. Where is Lake Martin in Alabama?

Alabama's latitude range: from about 30.2°N at the Florida border to 35°N at the Tennessee border.

Lake Martin is in east-central Alabama, so probably around 32.5°N to 33°N or so.

Dallas, TX is at 32.78°N.

Now, let's get specific.

I recall that Lake Martin is near Dadeville or Eclectic.

Eclectic, AL: Latitude 32.64°N

Dadeville, AL: 32.83°N

Alexander City: 32.94°N

Now, Dallas: 32.78°N

So, let's compare:

- Dallas: 32.78°N

- Dadeville: 32.83°N

- Eclectic: 32.64°N

- Alexander City: 32.94°N

Now, Lake Martin is between these, but let's say approximately 32.8°N or something.

Since parts of the lake are at different latitudes, but for simplicity, we can take an average or a point.

I think the Martin Dam, which is a key point, is at about 32.65°N or so? I'm not sure.

Perhaps I can think that Dallas is at 32.78°N, and Lake Martin area: let's take Alexander City at 32.94°N, which is north, or Eclectic at 32.64°N, which is south.

32.64°N vs 32.78°N: 32.64 is less than 32.78, so Eclectic is south of Dallas.

Similarly, Dadeville at 32.83°N is north of Dallas since 32.83 > 32.78.

So, parts of Lake Martin are south of Dallas, and parts are north? But the lake is a single entity, but geographically, it spans latitudes.

For the purpose of "located south," if any part is south, or do we consider the center?

I think for such questions, we usually consider a representative point or the general location.

But to be precise, let's find the latitude of Lake Martin.

Upon second thought, Lake Martin's coordinates: I can approximate.

I know that Montgomery, AL is at 32.36°N, and it's south of Lake Martin? No, Montgomery is south of the lake area.

Montgomery, AL latitude: about 32.36°N.

Lake Martin is north of Montgomery. Alexander City is about 50 miles north of Montgomery, so higher latitude.

Distance: one degree of latitude is about 69 miles, so 50 miles is about 0.72 degrees, so Montgomery at 32.36°N, Alexander City at 32.36 + 0.72? No, north, so higher latitude.

Montgomery to Alexander City is northward, so Alexander City latitude higher.

Montgomery: 32.36°N

Alexander City: 32.94°N, difference about 0.58 degrees, about 40 miles, which is reasonable.

Dallas: 32.78°N

Now, compared to Dallas:

- Montgomery at 32.36°N is south of Dallas (32.36 < 32.78)

- Alexander City at 32.94°N is north of Dallas (32.94 > 32.78)

Lake Martin is between, say from 32.6°N to 32.9°N or something.

I think the southern part of Lake Martin is around 32.6°N, and northern part around 32.9°N.

Dal-Tex Building in Dallas is at 32.78°N.

So, the southern shore of Lake Martin is at approximately 32.6°N, which is less than 32.78, so south of Dallas.

The northern shore at 32.9°N is north of Dallas.

Therefore, Lake Martin as a whole is not entirely south; part is south, part is north.

But the question is "is Lake Martin, AL located south of Dal-Tex Building, TX?"

In geography, when we say a place is south of another, it usually means that the entire place is south, or the centroid is south, but it can be ambiguous.

For example, we say Florida is south of Georgia, meaning generally.

Here, since Lake Martin spans latitude, we might need to see if the majority or the center is south.

But Dal-Tex Building is a specific point, so we should compare the latitude of Dal-Tex Building to the latitude of Lake Martin's location.

But Lake Martin isn't a point, so we need a reference.

Perhaps I can use the coordinates of the lake.

I recall that Lake Martin's dam, Martin Dam, is at 32.648°N, 85.934°W or something like that.

Let me assume: Martin Dam, AL coordinates: approximately 32.65°N.

Dal-Tex Building, Dallas, TX: I think it's at 32.7786°N, 96.8084°W or similar.

So, Dal-Tex latitude: about 32.78°N

Martin Dam: 32.65°N

32.65 < 32.78, so Martin Dam is south of Dal-Tex Building.

Since the dam is part of Lake Martin, we can say Lake Martin is south, but the lake extends north.

For practical purposes, Lake Martin is considered to be in that area, and since the dam is a key feature, or the general area.

Another point: Wind Creek State Park on Lake Martin is at about 32.80°N, which is very close to 32.78, almost the same latitude.

32.80N vs 32.78N: 32.80 is slightly north, but very close.

But let's be more precise.

I found online that the center of Lake Martin is approximately 32.75°N, but I'm not sure.

To avoid confusion, let's look for the city or town associated.

The question says "Lake Martin, AL" so it's the lake in Alabama.

But Dal-Tex Building is a specific building in Dallas.

So, I think we need to compare the location.

Perhaps I can think about the states.

Alabama is east of Texas, but for north-south, we need latitude.

Texas has a range, but Dallas is in north Texas.

Alabama is generally at similar latitudes to north Texas.

Specifically, Dallas is at 32.78°N.

Birmingham, AL is at 33.52°N, which is north of Dallas.

Montgomery, AL at 32.36°N is south of Dallas.

Lake Martin is between Birmingham and Montgomery, so around 32.8°N or so.

From earlier, Dadeville at 32.83°N, which is north of Dallas 32.78N by 0.05 degrees, about 3.45 miles north.

Eclectic at 32.64°N, which is south of Dallas by 0.14 degrees, about 9.66 miles south.

So, parts of Lake Martin are south of Dallas, and parts are north, but the center might be around 32.75N or something.

Let's calculate the midpoint.

Southern point: around 32.64N

Northern point: around 32.94N

Average: (32.64 + 32.94)/2 = 65.58/2 = 32.79N

32.79N vs Dallas 32.78N, so essentially the same latitude, with a negligible difference.

32.79 - 32.78 = 0.01 degrees, about 0.69 miles, so Lake Martin center is very slightly north of Dallas, but practically the same.

But for "south," since it's almost the same, it's not south; south would be distinctly lower latitude.

Moreover, the southern part is south, but the northern part is north.

However, for the purpose of this question, since the difference is small, and Lake Martin is not entirely south, I think the answer is no.

But let's confirm Dal-Tex Building specifically.

Dal-Tex Building is in downtown Dallas, at approximately 32.778°N.

Now, for Lake Martin, let's take a specific point: Martin Dam is at 32.648°N, which is south.

But the dam is one point; the lake includes areas north.

The question is "located south," which might imply the general location or the centroid.

I think in common usage, since Lake Martin spans the latitude, and Dallas is at 32.78, which is within the range of Lake Martin's latitudes (32.64 to 32.94), so Lake Martin is not entirely south of Dal-Tex Building; it straddles the latitude.

Therefore, it is not correct to say it is located south; instead, it is roughly at the same latitude, with parts south and parts north.

To be precise, since the centroid or average is very close, but slightly north, it is not south.

Moreover, cities near Lake Martin: Alexander City is north, Dadeville is north, Eclectic is south, but the lake itself.

Perhaps I can look for the official location.

Another idea: use geographic coordinates.

Upon quick search in my mind, I recall that Lake Martin's latitude ranges from approximately 32.60°N to 32.95°N.

Dal-Tex Building at 32.778°N.

Since 32.778 is greater than 32.60 and less than 32.95, it is within the range, so Dal-Tex Building is at a latitude that is between the southern and northern ends of Lake Martin.

Therefore, Lake Martin is not located entirely south of Dal-Tex Building; in fact, Dal-Tex is at a latitude inside Lake Martin's range.

So, for Lake Martin to be south of Dal-Tex, all points of Lake Martin must have lower latitude than Dal-Tex, which is not true because the northern part has higher latitude.

Similarly, for it to be north, all points must have higher latitude, which is not true.

So, it is neither entirely south nor entirely north; it spans the latitude.

Therefore, the answer to "is it located south" should be no.

If we consider the main part or the center, it's almost the same, but technically, the center at 32.79N is slightly north, so not south.

But the difference is tiny.

For practical purposes, I think the answer is no.

But let's see the question: "Is Lake Martin, AL located south of Dal-Tex Building, TX?"

Based on geography, no.

To confirm with another point.

I know that Houston, TX is at 29.76°N, which is south of Alabama.

But Dallas is north.

Mobile, AL is at 30.69°N, which is south of Dallas.

Lake Martin is north of Mobile.

Distance from Mobile to Lake Martin: Mobile at 30.69N, Lake Martin around 32.7N, difference 2 degrees, about 138 miles north.

Dallas at 32.78N, so Lake Martin at 32.7N is roughly same as Dallas.

Specifically, 32.7N vs 32.78N, so 32.7 is less, so south, but 32.7 is approximate.

Let's take 32.75N for Lake Martin center.

32.75 < 32.78? 32.75 is 32.75, 32.78 is 32.78, so 32.75 < 32.78, so if center is 32.75, it is south.

But earlier I calculated average as 32.79, which is higher.

Let's define.

Southern extent: near Tallassee or Eclectic.

Eclectic, AL: 32.635°N (approximately)

Northern extent: near Alexander City, 32.944°N

Dal-Tex: 32.778°N

So min latitude of Lake Martin: 32.635N

Max latitude: 32.944N

Dal-Tex: 32.778N

Since min lat 32.635 < 32.778, and max lat 32.944 > 32.778, so Lake Martin has points south and north of Dal-Tex.

Therefore, it is not located entirely south.

The centroid: average latitude (32.635 + 32.944)/2 = 65.579/2 = 32.7895N

32.7895N vs 32.778N, so centroid at 32.7895 > 32.778, so very slightly north.

Difference of 0.0115 degrees, about 0.8 miles north.

So, technically, the center is north of Dal-Tex Building.

Therefore, Lake Martin is not located south of Dal-Tex Building; it is roughly at the same latitude, with the center slightly north.

Hence, the answer should be no.

But to be thorough, let's confirm the coordinates.

I can accept that for the purpose of this question, since the southern part is south, but the question is about "Lake Martin" as a whole.

I think it's safe to say no.

Another way: is there a city near Lake Martin that is clearly south?

For example, Montgomery is at 32.36N, which is south of Dallas 32.78N, but Lake Martin is north of Montgomery.

Distance: Montgomery to Alexander City is about 50 miles, so latitude difference about 0.72 degrees, so Lake Martin around 32.36 + 0.72 = 33.08? No.

Montgomery at 32.36N, Alexander City at 32.94N, so 32.94 - 32.36 = 0.58 degrees, about 40 miles.

Dallas at 32.78N, so compared to Montgomery 32.36N, Dallas is north, Lake Martin is between.

32.36 (Montgomery) < 32.78 (Dallas) < 32.94 (Alexander City), so Dallas is between Montgomery and Alexander City in latitude.

Since Lake Martin includes areas from near 32.64 to 32.94, Dallas at 32.78 is within that range.

Therefore, Dal-Tex Building is at a latitude that is within the north-south extent of Lake Martin.

So, Lake Martin cannot be said to be south of it.

Thus, the answer is no.

Final decision: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations:**
   - Lake Martin, AL: A large reservoir in Alabama, spanning parts of Tallapoosa, Elmore, and Coosa counties. It is not a single point but covers a range of latitudes.
   - Dal-Tex Building, TX: A specific building located in Dallas, Texas, at approximately 32.778°N latitude and 96.808°W longitude.

2. **Determine the latitude range for Lake Martin, AL:**
   - Lake Martin spans a range of latitudes due to its size. Key reference points around the lake include:
     - Southern end near Eclectic, AL: Latitude approximately 32.635°N.
     - Northern end near Alexander City, AL: Latitude approximately 32.944°N.
     - Central point or centroid: Calculated as the average of the min and max latitudes: (32.635°N + 32.944°N) / 2 = 32.7895°N.
   - Thus, Lake Martin's latitude ranges from about 32.635°N to 32.944°N, with the centroid at approximately 32.79°N.

3. **Compare latitudes to determine if Lake Martin is south of Dal-Tex Building:**
   - Dal-Tex Building latitude: 32.778°N.
   - Lake Martin's minimum latitude: 32.635°N (southern end) is less than 32.778°N, meaning parts of Lake Martin are south of the Dal-Tex Building.
   - Lake Martin's maximum latitude: 32.944°N (northern end) is greater than 32.778°N, meaning parts of Lake Martin are north of the Dal-Tex Building.
   - Lake Martin's centroid latitude: 32.79°N is greater than 32.778°N, indicating that the center of the lake is slightly north of the Dal-Tex Building (difference of about 0.012° or roughly 0.8 miles north).

4. **Geographical interpretation:**
   - For a place to be considered "south" of another, it typically implies that the entire location or its centroid is at a lower latitude. Here:
     - Lake Martin is not entirely south of the Dal-Tex Building because its northern parts (e.g., near Alexander City) are north of 32.778°N.
     - The centroid of Lake Martin is slightly north of the Dal-Tex Building, further supporting that it is not positioned to the south.
     - Since Dal-Tex Building's latitude (32.778°N) falls within Lake Martin's latitude range (32.635°N to 32.944°N), the lake straddles the latitude of the building, meaning it is neither entirely south nor entirely north—it is roughly at the same latitude overall.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the latitude comparison, Lake Martin, AL is not located entirely south of Dal-Tex Building, TX. Parts of it are south, but the lake as a whole is not south due to its northern extent and centroid position.

**Final Answer: No**
