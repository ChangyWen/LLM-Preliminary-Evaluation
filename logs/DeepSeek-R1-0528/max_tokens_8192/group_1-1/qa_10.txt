*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: Was Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James" released earlier than Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under"? I need to answer yes or no, and show my step-by-step reasoning.

I need to recall the release dates for both songs.

Starting with Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James". I think this song is from their album "Check Your Head". Let me confirm that. Yes, "Check Your Head" was released in 1992. I believe it was April 21, 1992. I should double-check that.

Now, for Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under". This is from their album "Images and Words". I think "Images and Words" was released in 1992 as well. Specifically, I recall it was July 7, 1992.

So both are from 1992, but I need the exact dates to compare.

Let me think about Beastie Boys first. "Check Your Head" was released on April 21, 1992. And "Jimmy James" is a track on that album, so the song release date would be the same as the album release date, unless it was released as a single earlier.

Did "Jimmy James" come out as a single? I think it was a single, but let me recall. Upon thinking, "Jimmy James" was indeed released as a single from "Check Your Head". When was the single released?

I should look this up, but since I'm an AI, I can access my knowledge base. Beastie Boys released "Jimmy James" as a single in 1992. I think it was released around the same time as the album. Typically, singles are released close to the album release.

Similarly, for Dream Theater, "Pull Me Under" was a single from "Images and Words". I think the single was released in 1992 as well.

But I need specific dates.

Let me recall: "Pull Me Under" single was released on August 21, 1992. Is that right? I think so.

And for "Jimmy James", the single release date. I believe it was released in June 1992 or something. I need to be precise.

Perhaps I should think in terms of album release dates, as songs are often released with the album.

Album release dates:

- Beastie Boys - "Check Your Head": April 21, 1992

- Dream Theater - "Images and Words": July 7, 1992

Therefore, "Jimmy James" was released on April 21, 1992, and "Pull Me Under" on July 7, 1992.

So, April 21 is earlier than July 7, so "Jimmy James" was released earlier.

But is that accurate? Let me confirm the album release dates.

I remember that "Check Your Head" was indeed released on April 21, 1992. That's standard knowledge.

"Images and Words" was released on July 7, 1992. Yes.

Now, about singles: sometimes singles are released before the album.

For "Pull Me Under", I think the single was released before the album. Dream Theater released "Pull Me Under" as the lead single, and I believe it came out in June 1992 or something. I need to check.

Upon recollection, "Pull Me Under" single was released on August 21, 1992, which is after the album release on July 7. That doesn't make sense because singles are usually before or around the same time.

I think I have it wrong.

Let me think: "Images and Words" was released on July 7, 1992, and "Pull Me Under" was the first single. I believe the single was released in late June or early July.

I found a memory: "Pull Me Under" was released as a single on June 29, 1992, in some regions, and the album on July 7. But I'm not sure.

To be precise, let's assume the song release date is the album release date unless specified otherwise.

Similarly for "Jimmy James".

But "Jimmy James" was released as a single. When?

Beastie Boys released "Pass the Mic" as the first single from "Check Your Head" in March 1992, and "Jimmy James" was the second single, released in June 1992.

Is that right?

Let me confirm.

Upon thinking, "Check Your Head" album: released April 21, 1992.

Singles: "Pass the Mic" released March 1992, "So What'cha Want" released June 1992, and "Jimmy James" released as a single on September 15, 1992.

I think that's it.

I recall: "Jimmy James" was the third single from the album, released later.

Similarly for Dream Theater.

Let me get the facts straight.

First, Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James":

- Album: "Check Your Head" release date: April 21, 1992

- "Jimmy James" was released as a single on September 15, 1992.

Yes, that sounds familiar. For example, in the US, it was released in September 1992.

Now, Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under":

- Album: "Images and Words" release date: July 7, 1992

- "Pull Me Under" was released as a single. When? I think it was released on August 21, 1992, in Japan or something, but globally, it might be different.

The single "Pull Me Under" was released in July 1992, around the album release.

Specifically, I believe the single release date is July 7, 1992, or close to it.

But to be accurate, let's find the earliest release date for each song.

For comparison, we can use the album release date as the song availability date.

But since the question is about the song release, and singles might have different dates, I should consider the single release date if available.

However, for "Jimmy James", if the single was released in September 1992, but the song was available on the album in April, so technically, the song was released in April.

Similarly, for "Pull Me Under", available in July.

So April is earlier than July.

But let's confirm the single dates to be thorough.

For "Jimmy James" single: released on September 15, 1992, as per standard sources.

For "Pull Me Under" single: released on August 21, 1992, in the US, I think. But let's see.

Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under" single was released on July 29, 1992, in Japan, and August 21, 1992, in the US.

But the album was out on July 7, so the song was available then.

Similarly, for Beastie Boys, the song was available on April 21.

So, comparing album release dates:

- "Jimmy James": April 21, 1992

- "Pull Me Under": July 7, 1992

April 21 is before July 7, so "Jimmy James" was released earlier.

If we consider single release:

- "Jimmy James" single: September 15, 1992

- "Pull Me Under" single: let's say July 29 or August 21, 1992

Then "Pull Me Under" single was released in July/August, which is before September, so in that case, "Pull Me Under" might be earlier if we go by single release.

But that doesn't make sense because the song was already out on the album.

The question is about the song release, not necessarily the single.

Typically, when we say a song was released, it refers to when it first became available, which is usually the album release date.

For example, "Jimmy James" was first released on April 21, 1992, with the album, and the single came later.

Similarly, "Pull Me Under" was first released on July 7, 1992, with the album.

Therefore, since April 21 is earlier than July 7, "Jimmy James" was released earlier.

To confirm, let's think about chart performances or something.

"Pull Me Under" became popular later, but release date is when it came out.

I think I should just go with the album dates.

Final decision:

- Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James" release date: April 21, 1992 (with "Check Your Head")

- Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under" release date: July 7, 1992 (with "Images and Words")

Therefore, April 21, 1992 is earlier than July 7, 1992.

So, yes, "Jimmy James" was released earlier.

But the question is: "Was Beastie Boys’s Jimmy James released earlier than Dream Theater’s Pull Me Under?"

Based on this, yes.

But let me make sure about the single for "Jimmy James". If the single was released earlier, but I don't think so.

"Pass the Mic" was the first single, released in March 1992, but "Jimmy James" was not released as a single until September, so the song itself debuted with the album.

Similarly, no single for "Pull Me Under" before the album, I believe.

So album dates should be fine.

Therefore, answer should be yes.

But I recall that sometimes singles are released before albums, but in this case, for both, the singles came after or around the same time.

For Dream Theater, "Pull Me Under" single might have been released a bit before, but I think it was after or same day.

Upon second thought, "Images and Words" was released on July 7, 1992, and "Pull Me Under" was serviced to radio around that time, but the single release date is often listed as August 1992.

But for the song's first availability, it's July 7.

Similarly for Beastie Boys, April 21.

So I think it's clear.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the release date for Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James".

   - "Jimmy James" is a song from the album "Check Your Head".

   - "Check Your Head" was released on April 21, 1992.

   - Therefore, "Jimmy James" was released on April 21, 1992.

2. Identify the release date for Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under".

   - "Images and Words" was released on July 7, 1992.

   - Therefore, "Pull Me Under" was released on July 7, 1992.

3. Compare the dates: April 21, 1992 vs. July 7, 1992.

   - April 21, 1992 is earlier than July 7, 1992.

4. Conclusion: Yes, Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James" was released earlier than Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under".

Final answer: Yes.
