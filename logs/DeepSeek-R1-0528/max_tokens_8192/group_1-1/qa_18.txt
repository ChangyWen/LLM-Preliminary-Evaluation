*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine the locations of Cambria County, PA and Cattaraugus County, NY. Specifically, I need to see if Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County.

I should start by recalling where these counties are. Pennsylvania and New York are adjacent states, with Pennsylvania to the south and west of New York. But I need more precise locations.

Let me think about the geography. Cattaraugus County is in New York. I believe it's in the western part of New York State. Cambria County is in Pennsylvania, and I think it's in the western part as well, but I'm not entirely sure.

I should look at a map mentally. New York State has counties like Erie County with Buffalo, which is on the western border with Pennsylvania. Cattaraugus County is adjacent to Erie County, I think, so it should be in western New York.

Similarly, Pennsylvania has counties like Allegheny County with Pittsburgh in the west. Cambria County is near there; I think it includes Johnstown, which is west-central Pennsylvania.

To be precise, I need longitudes because "west" is about the east-west position, so longitude will tell me which one is further west.

I don't have a map in front of me, but I can reason based on known cities or geographic features.

Let me recall key cities:

- In Cattaraugus County, NY: I think the main city is Olean, or something like that. Olean is in Cattaraugus County. What's the longitude of Olean?

I should use approximate longitudes. I know that the prime meridian is in Greenwich, and longitudes decrease as you go west in the US, since it's west of Greenwich.

For example, New York City is around 74°W longitude. But that's eastern.

Buffalo, NY, is in Erie County, which is western NY. Buffalo is approximately 78.8°W longitude.

Cattaraugus County is east of Erie County, I think. Let me think about the counties.

New York counties: Starting from the west, you have Chautauqua County, then Cattaraugus County, then Allegany County, etc. Chautauqua is the westernmost, with Jamestown. Cattaraugus is east of that.

Cattaraugus County shares a border with Pennsylvania. Actually, looking at the map mentally, the southern border of New York with Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania's northern border is with New York. Cambria County is not on the border; it's more inland.

Let me find a reference point.

I can think of the longitude of the counties' seats or centroids.

Cattaraugus County seat is Little Valley, NY. But I don't know the longitude.

Olean is a larger city in Cattaraugus County. Olean, NY longitude is approximately 78.43°W. I think that's close.

Let me confirm: I recall that Buffalo is about 78.88°W, and Olean is south-east of Buffalo, so it might have a similar or slightly east longitude.

Buffalo is at 78.88°W, but since Olean is directly south, it should have almost the same longitude, but let's see.

Actually, longitude lines run north-south, so moving south doesn't change longitude; it's latitude that changes.

So, places directly north-south have the same longitude.

Buffalo and Olean are not directly north-south; Olean is southeast of Buffalo.

Buffalo is at approximately 42.89°N, 78.88°W.

Olean, NY is at about 42.08°N, 78.43°W. I think that's right. Let me assume that.

I can look for approximate values.

Since I need to compare, I can use a known line.

The border between New York and Pennsylvania runs along 42°N latitude, but the longitude varies.

Perhaps I should find the longitude of the western part of Cattaraugus County.

Cattaraugus County extends from about 78.2°W to 79.0°W or something. I need better data.

Let's think differently. Cambria County, PA. Its county seat is Ebensburg, PA.

Ebensburg, PA longitude: I think it's around 78.7°W or something.

Johnstown, PA is in Cambria County. Johnstown is at approximately 78.92°W.

I remember that Pittsburgh is about 80.0°W, and Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh is at 80.0°W, and Johnstown is at 78.92°W, so east of Pittsburgh.

Cattaraugus County, NY: Olean is at 78.43°W, as I thought.

Olean, NY: 42.08°N, 78.43°W

Johnstown, PA: 40.33°N, 78.92°W

Comparing longitudes: 78.92°W vs 78.43°W.

Since longitudes are measured west from Greenwich, a higher number means further west.

So, 78.92°W is west of 78.43°W because 78.92 is greater than 78.43.

In decimal degrees, west longitude increases as you go west.

So, Johnstown, PA at 78.92°W is west of Olean, NY at 78.43°W.

But Olean is in Cattaraugus County, and Johnstown is in Cambria County.

Therefore, Cambria County, PA is west of Cattaraugus County, NY.

Is that correct? Let me make sure.

Cattaraugus County has points further west. For example, the western border might be further west than Olean.

Cattaraugus County's western border is with Chautauqua County. The city of Salamanca is in Cattaraugus County, I think, which is near the western edge.

Salamanca, NY: approximately 78.72°W. Let me confirm.

Salamanca, NY: 42.16°N, 78.72°W or something.

I think Salamanca is around 78.7°W.

Similarly, the eastern part might be less.

But Johnstown is at 78.92°W, which is west of 78.72°W.

78.92 > 78.72, so Johnstown is west of Salamanca.

Salamanca is in Cattaraugus County, so the western part of Cattaraugus County is around 78.72°W, while Johnstown is at 78.92°W, which is further west.

Therefore, Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County.

But Cambria County is not just Johnstown; it might extend east or west.

The centroid or the average.

But generally, since Johnstown is a major point, and Cattaraugus County's westernmost point is less than 79°W.

Cattaraugus County longitude range: I think from about 78.2°W to 78.8°W or so.

Upon second thought, Chautauqua County to the west has Jamestown at about 79.24°W, and Cattaraugus is east of that.

Cattaraugus County's western border is with Chautauqua, so longitude around 79.0°W? No.

Let's think: the border between Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties.

I recall that the longitude of the western edge of Cattaraugus County is approximately 79.0°W, but I think that's not right.

Buffalo is at 78.88°W, and it's Erie County, which is north of Cattaraugus.

Cattaraugus County is south of Erie County.

The longitude lines: since they are at different latitudes, but longitude is consistent.

Olean is at 78.43°W, Salamanca at about 78.72°W, and the western border might be near 78.75°W or so.

For example, the city of Randolph is in Cattaraugus County, at 78.97°W? I think Randolph is in Cattaraugus? No, I think Randolph is in Cattaraugus County.

Let me clarify: Cattaraugus County cities.

Perhaps I can use geographic coordinates.

I remember that the Pennsylvania-New York border is at 42°N, and at that latitude, the longitude of the border.

But the border is straight, but counties vary.

To simplify, let's take the county seats.

Cattaraugus County seat: Little Valley, NY.

Little Valley, NY coordinates: approximately 42.25°N, 78.80°W. I think it's around there.

Upon recall, Little Valley is at 42.25°N, 78.80°W.

Similarly, Cambria County seat: Ebensburg, PA.

Ebensburg, PA: 40.48°N, 78.72°W? I think Johnstown is better known.

Johnstown, PA: 40.33°N, 78.92°W.

Now, Little Valley, NY: let's confirm the longitude.

I can assume that Little Valley is about 78.8°W.

Similarly, Olean is 78.43°W.

But for the county, the western part is more relevant.

Salamanca, NY is often cited; it's at 78.72°W (latitude 42.16°N).

Johnstown, PA at 78.92°W.

78.92 > 78.72, so Johnstown is west of Salamanca.

Since Salamanca is in Cattaraugus County and is one of the westernmost points, and Johnstown is in Cambria County, which is to the west.

Moreover, Cambria County is entirely within Pennsylvania, and Cattaraugus in New York, but since Pennsylvania is south and west of New York in this region.

But specifically for counties.

Another way: the eastern border of Cattaraugus County is with Allegany County, NY, which has Belmont at about 78.03°W, so Cattaraugus extends to about 78.0°W to 78.8°W.

Westernmost around 78.8°W.

Cambria County, PA: Johnstown at 78.92°W, and it extends east to, say, Patton or something, but Patton, PA is at 78.65°W or so? Patton is in Cambria County.

Patton, PA: approximately 40.63°N, 78.65°W.

So Cambria County from about 78.65°W to 79.0°W or something, but Johnstown is 78.92, and west might be less.

The western part: Cambria County borders Indiana County to the west, which has Indiana, PA at 79.15°W, so Cambria western edge around 79.0°W? Not necessarily.

Indiana County is west of Cambria, so Cambria's western border is less than Indiana's.

For example, the city of Nanty Glo in Cambria County is at 78.83°W or something.

I think I'm getting too detailed.

Simply, the easternmost point of Cattaraugus County is around 78.0°W and westernmost around 78.8°W.

Cambria County: easternmost around 78.65°W (Patton) and westernmost around 78.92W or more? Johnstown is at 78.92, but the county might go further west.

Looking at a map mentally, Cambria County is roughly centered around 78.8°W or so.

But from numbers: Cattaraugus County western longitude ~78.8°W, Cambria County eastern longitude ~78.65°W, but 78.65 is east of 78.8? No.

78.65°W vs 78.80°W: 78.65 is less than 78.80, so 78.65°W is east of 78.80°W.

Longitude: smaller number (less west) is east, larger number is west.

So, 78.65°W is 78.65 degrees west, which is closer to prime meridian than 78.80°W, so 78.65°W is east of 78.80°W.

For example:

- Cattaraugus County western point: approx 78.80°W

- Cambria County eastern point: approx 78.65°W (Patton)

78.65 < 78.80, so 78.65°W is east of 78.80°W.

Therefore, the eastern part of Cambria County is east of the western part of Cattaraugus County.

But that doesn't mean the whole county is west; it depends on the range.

To compare if one county is west of the other, we need to see if the entire Cambria County is west of the entire Cattaraugus County, or just if on average or if the eastern point is west, etc.

But typically, for such questions, we look at the relative position.

From the longitudes:

Cattaraugus County min longitude ~78.0°W, max ~78.8°W

Cambria County min longitude ~78.65°W, max ~78.95°W or so.

So, Cambria County extends from about 78.65°W to 78.95°W.

Cattaraugus County from 78.0°W to 78.8°W.

Now, the westernmost point of Cattaraugus is 78.8°W, and the easternmost point of Cambria is 78.65°W.

Since 78.65 < 78.8, 78.65°W is east of 78.8°W.

Therefore, the eastern part of Cambria County is east of the western part of Cattaraugus County.

Specifically, at longitude 78.65°W (Cambria east) is east of 78.8°W (Cattaraugus west).

But since Cattaraugus has points as east as 78.0°W, which is far east, and Cambria has points as west as 78.95°W, which is west of Cattaraugus.

However, to say Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County, it would be false because parts of Cambria are east of parts of Cattaraugus.

For example, the eastern part of Cambria (78.65°W) is east of the western part of Cattaraugus (78.8°W).

In terms of the entire counties, Cambria is not entirely west of Cattaraugus; they overlap in longitude.

But the question is "located west of", which might mean if it is generally to the west, or if the centroid is west.

But I think for practical purposes, we can compare central points.

County seats:

Cattaraugus County seat: Little Valley, NY. Let's find coordinates.

I think I need to look this up, but since I'm reasoning, let's assume.

Little Valley, NY: 42.2528°N, 78.8056°W (approximately 42.25°N, 78.81°W)

Cambria County seat: Ebensburg, PA: 40.4850°N, 78.7247°W (approximately 40.49°N, 78.72°W)

Now, longitudes: Little Valley ~78.81°W, Ebensburg ~78.72°W.

78.72 < 78.81, so Ebensburg is east of Little Valley.

78.72°W is a smaller number, so less west, therefore east.

Ebensburg longitude 78.72°W, Little Valley 78.81°W.

78.72 < 78.81, so Ebensburg is east of Little Valley.

Therefore, the county seat of Cambria is east of the county seat of Cattaraugus.

But Cattaraugus County extends west to about 78.8°W, and Cambria has points at 78.92W.

Johnstown, PA in Cambria: 40.3253°N, 78.9194°W ~78.92°W

Olean, NY in Cattaraugus: 42.0776°N, 78.4297°W ~78.43°W

78.92 > 78.43, so Johnstown is west of Olean.

Salamanca, NY: 42.1578°N, 78.7158°W ~78.72°W

Johnstown 78.92W > 78.72W, so west.

But Salamanca is not the westernmost; Cattaraugus County has a point near Chautauqua County.

The western border longitude is approximately 79.0°W? No, Chautauqua County starts around 79.2°W for Jamestown.

The border between Chautauqua and Cattaraugus is around 79.0°W, but I think it's less.

For example, the city of Conewango in Cattaraugus County is at 79.0217°W? I think that's in Chautauqua.

Cattaraugus County's westernmost point is approximately 78.85°W or so. Let's not overcomplicate.

From online sources or general knowledge, the longitude range for Cattaraugus County is roughly 78°W to 78.8°W.

Similarly, Cambria County is from 78.5°W to 79.0°W, but let's say 78.6W to 78.9W.

But based on Johnstown at 78.92W and Patton at 78.65W, so 78.65 to 78.92W.

Cattaraugus from Olean 78.43W to Salamanca 78.72W, but the county extends further east to 78.0W or so, like Ischua or something.

Cattaraugus County: the eastern border is with Allegany County at about 78.0W, and western at about 78.8W.

So min longitude 78.0W, max 78.8W.

Cambria County min longitude 78.65W, max 78.92W.

Now, the easternmost point of Cambria is 78.65W, which is west of the easternmost point of Cattaraugus (78.0W) because 78.65 > 78.0, so 78.65W is west of 78.0W.

But compared to the westernmost, Cattaraugus westernmost 78.8W, Cambria westernmost 78.92W, so Cambria has points west of Cattaraugus.

For the "west of" question, since the easternmost point of Cambria (78.65W) is west of the easternmost point of Cattaraugus (78.0W), and the westernmost point of Cambria (78.92W) is west of the westernmost point of Cattaraugus (78.8W), but the easternmost of Cambria (78.65W) is east of the westernmost of Cattaraugus (78.8W) because 78.65 < 78.8.

To determine if one is west of the other, we can see if the entire Cambria County is west of the entire Cattaraugus County.

That would require that the easternmost point of Cambria is west of the westernmost point of Cattaraugus.

Here, easternmost Cambria 78.65W vs westernmost Cattaraugus 78.8W.

78.65 < 78.8, so 78.65W is east of 78.8W, so eastern Cambria is east of western Cattaraugus, so Cambria is not entirely west of Cattaraugus; they overlap.

In fact, most of Cambria is east of the western part of Cattaraugus, but since Cattaraugus extends further east, Cambria is generally west of the eastern part but not of the whole.

But for the purpose of this question, "located west of" might mean if it is to the west, so we can compare the central longitudes.

County seat longitudes:

Little Valley, NY (Cattaraugus): 78.81°W

Ebensburg, PA (Cambria): 78.72°W

78.72 < 78.81, so Ebensburg is east of Little Valley.

Therefore, based on county seats, Cambria County seat is east of Cattaraugus County seat.

Johnstown is at 78.92W, which is west of Little Valley at 78.81W (78.92 > 78.81).

But Johnstown is not the seat; Ebensburg is.

But both are in the county.

The centroid of Cattaraugus County might be around 78.5W or something.

I think I'm making it messy.

Let's use a different approach.

I know that Cattaraugus County, NY is directly north of McKean County, PA, for example.

McKean County, PA is in Pennsylvania, and Cattaraugus is in New York, sharing a border.

Cambria County is south of Clearfield County, PA, and not directly related.

But Cattaraugus County borders Pennsylvania, and the counties south of it in PA are Warren, McKean, etc.

Warren County, PA is at the border, longitude similar to Cattaraugus.

Cambria County is further south and east.

Johnstown, PA is at 78.92W, and Bradford, PA in McKean County is at 78.65W, and Bradford is north of Cambria.

McKean County is at the border with Cattaraugus.

Bradford, PA: 41.96N, 78.65W

Olean, NY: 42.08N, 78.43W

So Olean is at 78.43W, Bradford at 78.65W.

Cambria County, with Johnstown at 78.92W, which is west of both.

78.92W is west of 78.65W and 78.43W.

But Cattaraugus County has areas at 78.43W to 78.72W, so Johnstown at 78.92W is west of all of Cattaraugus, since 78.92 > 78.72.

Salamanca is 78.72W, 78.92 > 78.72, so yes.

But Cambria County also has eastern parts at 78.65W, which is east of some parts of Cattaraugus.

For example, 78.65W vs 78.72W: 78.65 < 78.72, so 78.65W is east of 78.72W.

In Cattaraugus County, Salamanca at 78.72W, so a point at 78.65W in Cambria is east of Salamanca.

But Salamanca is in Cattaraugus, so there are points in Cattaraugus that are west of points in Cambria.

Specifically, Salamanca at 78.72W is west of Patton, Cambria at 78.65W.

78.72 > 78.65, so Salamanca is west of Patton.

Therefore, Cattaraugus has points west of Cambria's eastern points.

So Cambria is not entirely west of Cattaraugus.

However, the bulk of Cambria might be west.

But I think for the question, since the counties overlap in longitude, it's not strictly west.

But let's see the latitude difference.

Cattaraugus County is around 42N, Cambria around 40.5N, so they are not on the same latitude, so "west of" might not be directly comparable, but in terms of longitude, we can say.

Perhaps the question means if Cambria County is located to the west of Cattaraugus County, meaning if you go west from Cattaraugus, you reach Cambria or something.

But geographically, from Cattaraugus County, if you go west, you enter Chautauqua County, NY or Erie County, not directly to Cambria PA.

Cambria PA is south of Cattaraugus NY.

From Cattaraugus, south is Pennsylvania, but Cambria is further south and west.

Specifically, south of Cattaraugus is McKean County, PA, then Elk County, then Cambria County is southeast of that.

So Cambria is south and east of Cattaraugus, not west.

Let's think directions.

Cattaraugus County, NY: let's say center at 42.2N, 78.5W

Cambria County, PA: center at 40.5N, 78.8W

So from Cattaraugus at (42.2N, 78.5W) to Cambria at (40.5N, 78.8W), so you go south and west, but primarily south, since latitude change is larger.

But the longitude difference: from 78.5W to 78.8W is a small change west, but the latitude change is significant south.

So Cambria is not directly west; it's south-west.

But for the longitude, Cambria has a higher longitude, so it is west.

But based on the county positions, since Cattaraugus has points as west as 78.8W and Cambria as east as 78.65W, and 78.65 < 78.8, so Cambria has points east of Cattaraugus's western points.

Therefore, it is not accurate to say Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County.

In fact, Cattaraugus County is west of the eastern part of Cambria.

But let's answer the question.

I think I found a better way.

Let's use the fact that the New York-Pennsylvania border at that area.

The border is at 42N latitude.

Cattaraugus County is north of the border, Cambria County is south.

The longitude of the border in that region.

For example, at the border, directly south of Cattaraugus is McKean County, PA.

McKean County seat Smethport or Bradford.

Bradford, PA: 41.96N, 78.65W, but it's not on the border; the border is at 42N.

The city of Lewis Run, PA or something.

Approximate longitude on the border: since Cattaraugus County southern border is at 42N, and it ranges from about 78.0W to 78.8W.

Similarly, Cambria County is far from the border; it's at around 40.5N.

So to compare, we need to see the relative longitude.

I recall that Pittsburgh, PA is at 80.0W, and Buffalo, NY at 78.88W.

Cattaraugus County is between Buffalo and the Pennsylvania border, so longitude less than 78.88W, say 78.4W to 78.8W.

Cambria County is east of Pittsburgh; Johnstown is at 78.92W, which is east of Pittsburgh 80.0W, but west of Cattaraugus.

78.92W is west of 78.8W.

But again, Cattaraugus has points at 78.8W, Cambria at 78.92W, so Cambria is west, but Cambria also has points at 78.65W, which is east of 78.8W.

78.65W vs 78.8W: 78.65 is 0.15 degrees east of 78.8.

1 degree of longitude is about 85 km at 40N, so 0.15 degrees is about 12.75 km.

So the eastern part of Cambria is about 12 km east of the western part of Cattaraugus.

But since Cattaraugus extends east to 78.0W, which is far, Cambria is generally to the west of the eastern part of Cattaraugus, but not of the whole county.

For practical purposes, I think the answer is that Cambria County is not located west of Cattaraugus County; it is located south-west, but with some overlap.

But let's see the question: "Is Cambria County, PA located west of Cattaraugus County, NY?"

Based on the coordinates, the center of Cattaraugus is at a lower longitude (less west) than the center of Cambria.

Cattaraugus center longitude approximately 78.5W, Cambria center approximately 78.8W.

78.8 > 78.5, so Cambria center is west of Cattaraugus center.

Therefore, yes, it is located west.

But due to the shape, there is overlap.

I think for this context, we can say yes.

Let's check online or common knowledge.

I remember that Cattaraugus County is in Western New York, and Cambria County is in Western Pennsylvania, but Western New York is east of Western Pennsylvania.

For example, Erie, PA is at 80.08W, while Buffalo, NY is at 78.88W, so Erie, PA is west of Buffalo, NY.

Similarly, Johnstown, PA at 78.92W is west of Olean, NY at 78.43W.

And since Cattaraugus County is mostly at longitudes less than 78.8W, and Cambria at greater than 78.65W, with the mean of Cambria west of mean of Cattaraugus, I think it's safe to say that Cambria County is located west of Cattaraugus County.

The eastern boundary of Cattaraugus is at 78.0W, which is east of all of Cambria, since Cambria east is 78.65W, and 78.65 > 78.0, so all of Cambria is west of the eastern part of Cattaraugus, but not west of the western part.

But the western part of Cattaraugus is at 78.8W, and Cambria east at 78.65W is east of that.

So to be precise, Cambria County is not entirely west of Cattaraugus County because the eastern edge of Cambria is east of the western edge of Cattaraugus.

Therefore, the answer should be no.

But let's see the question again: "located west of" might mean if it is positioned to the west, not necessarily that all points are west.

In geography, we often compare central points.

Perhaps for this context, since the counties are close, we can say.

I found a better way: let's use the fact that Cattaraugus County, NY shares a border with McKean County, PA, which is at approximately 78.6W to 78.8W.

Cambria County is south of Clearfield County, which is west of Cambria.

Clearfield County is at about 78.7W to 79.0W, and Cambria is east of that.

Cambria County is directly south of Clearfield County and north of Somerset County.

Cattaraugus is north of McKean County.

McKean County and Cambria County are not adjacent; there is Elk County in between.

Elk County, PA has St. Marys at 78.56W, Ridgway at 78.73W.

Cambria County is east of Indiana County.

The longitude of McKean County, which is directly south of Cattaraugus, is similar to Cattaraugus, around 78.4W to 78.7W.

Cambria County is further south and east, with longitudes 78.65W to 78.92W.

So the eastern part of McKean/Cattaraugus is at 78.4W, which is east of Cambria's 78.65W, but the western part of McKean/Cattaraugus is at 78.7W, and Cambria's eastern part at 78.65W is slightly east of that.

But for Cattaraugus itself, its western point is at 78.8W, and Cambria's eastern point at 78.65W is east of that.

I think I have to conclude that Cambria County is not located west of Cattaraugus County; rather, it is south-east or something.

Let's calculate the difference.

Take Little Valley, Cattaraugus seat: 78.81W

Ebensburg, Cambria seat: 78.72W

78.72W vs 78.81W: 78.72 is 0.09 degrees east.

Johnstown, Cambria: 78.92W, which is 0.11 degrees west of Little Valley.

But since the seat is at 78.72W, which is east, and the county extends, I think for the purpose of this question, it is not considered west.

Perhaps the answer is no.

I recall that Cattaraugus County is at a more western longitude than Cambria County for some parts.

Let's look for a map online, but since I can't, I'll go with the data.

Another idea: the time zone. Both are in Eastern Time Zone, so no help.

I think I should accept that based on the county seats, Ebensburg at 78.72W is east of Little Valley at 78.81W, so Cambria County seat is east, therefore Cambria County is not west of Cattaraugus County.

Moreover, from a map, Cattaraugus County is west of Cambria County in terms of position.

For example, if you look at a map of PA and NY, Cattaraugus County, NY is north of Bradford, PA, and Cambria County is south of Altoona or something, which is further east.

Altoona is in Blair County, east of Cambria.

Blair County has Altoona at 78.4W, which is east.

But Cambria is west of Blair.

But Cattaraugus is north of McKean, which is at similar longitude as Blair? No.

McKean County: Bradford at 78.65W, which is similar to Altoona at 78.4W? 78.65 vs 78.4, 78.65 is west.

Bradford 78.65W, Altoona 78.4W, so Bradford is west of Altoona.

Cattaraugus County is north of Bradford, so at similar longitude.

Cambria County is south of Clearfield, with Dubois at 78.76W, and Johnstown at 78.92W.

So Cattaraugus at around 78.5W, Cambria at 78.8W, so Cambria is west.

I think I'm confusing myself.

Let's stop and give an answer.

Final decision: based on the longitude comparison, the western part of Cambria is west of Cattaraugus, but the eastern part is east of the western part of Cattaraugus, so there is overlap. However, since the mean longitude of Cambria is higher (more west) than that of Cattaraugus, and for general purposes, Cambria County is located west of Cattaraugus County.

But to be accurate, I think the answer is yes.

Let's see the title or context.

Perhaps I can say yes because Johnstown is west of Olean, and both are in the counties.

But the counties have different shapes.

I found a source in my memory: the distance.

From Olean, NY to Johnstown, PA is about 110 miles south-east, but let's see the direction.

Olean, NY: 42.08N, 78.43W

Johnstown, PA: 40.33N, 78.92W

Difference in latitude: 40.33 - 42.08 = -1.75 degrees south

Difference in longitude: 78.92 - 78.43 = 0.49 degrees west

So Johnstown is 0.49 degrees west and 1.75 degrees south of Olean.

So it is south-west, but the west component is small.

Compared to the county, since Cattaraugus extends to 78.72W, Johnstown at 78.92W is 0.2 degrees west, which is about 17 km west.

Similarly, Ebensburg at 78.72W is at the same longitude as Salamanca, so not west.

I think for the county as a whole, it is not strictly west.

But perhaps the answer expected is yes.

Let's think about the state position.

Pennsylvania is west of New York, so counties in western PA are west of counties in western NY.

For example, Erie, PA is west of Buffalo, NY.

Similarly, Johnstown, PA is west of Jamestown, NY or Olean.

Olean is in NY, Johnstown in PA, and PA is south and west of NY.

So yes.

Cattaraugus County is at the same longitude as central PA, but Cambria is in western PA.

I think I should conclude that Cambria County, PA is located west of Cattaraugus County, NY.

So the answer is yes.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Cattaraugus County, NY is in the western part of New York State. Its approximate longitude range is from 78.0°W to 78.8°W.

2. Cambria County, PA is in the
