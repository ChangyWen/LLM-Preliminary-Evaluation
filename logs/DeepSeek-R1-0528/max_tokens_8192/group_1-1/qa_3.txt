*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given two movies:
  1. "Nightmare Honeymoon" directed by Elliot Silverstein
  2. "Gold" directed by Peter R. Hunt

We need to determine if "Nightmare Honeymoon" was released later than "Gold".

Step 1: Recall or research the release years of both films.

For "Gold":
- Directed by Peter R. Hunt.
- Released in 1974.

For "Nightmare Honeymoon":
- Directed by Elliot Silverstein.
- Released in 1974 as well? Let's check.

Wait, let me be precise:
- "Gold" (1974) is a British adventure film directed by Peter R. Hunt.
- "Nightmare Honeymoon" (also known as "Deadly Honeymoon") is a 1974 American thriller film directed by Elliot Silverstein.

So both were released in 1974? Then we need to know the exact release dates.

Step 2: Check the specific release dates.

For "Gold":
- The release date in the United Kingdom was 18 April 1974.
- The release date in the United States was 27 December 1974.

But note: we are comparing the release dates. The film might have been released in different countries at different times. However, typically we consider the earliest release in any country as the release date for the film? Or the country of origin?

But the problem doesn't specify. We'll try to get the initial release dates.

For "Gold":
- UK release: 18 April 1974.

For "Nightmare Honeymoon":
- It was released in the United States on 17 May 1974.

Therefore:
- "Gold" was first released in the UK on 18 April 1974.
- "Nightmare Honeymoon" was released in the US on 17 May 1974.

Step 3: Compare the dates.
- The first release of "Gold" (April 18, 1974) is earlier than the release of "Nightmare Honeymoon" (May 17, 1974).

Therefore, "Nightmare Honeymoon" was released later than "Gold".

Answer: Yes.
