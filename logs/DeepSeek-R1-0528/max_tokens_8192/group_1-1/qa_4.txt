*********************************** End of Inputs **************************************




*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: Is WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan located south of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan? I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Williamsburg and Hillman Houses are both in Manhattan, New York City. But I should confirm the exact locations.

Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" – that might be a mistake. Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Similarly, Hillman Houses is a public housing development located in Manhattan.

Hillman Houses is in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. I think it's at 75 Pitt Street, which is on the Lower East Side.

But Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, which is a separate borough. So, if Williamsburg is in Brooklyn and Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, how can we compare their north-south positions? Brooklyn is to the east and southeast of Manhattan.

I need to think about geographical coordinates. Manhattan and Brooklyn are adjacent, but Manhattan is generally west of Brooklyn. In terms of latitude, the southern part of Brooklyn is south of the southern tip of Manhattan, but Williamsburg is in northern Brooklyn, so it might be at a similar latitude to parts of Manhattan.

Let me recall a map of New York City. Manhattan is oriented roughly north-south, with uptown being north and downtown being south. Brooklyn is to the east, across the East River.

Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, directly east of the Lower East Side of Manhattan. So, it's opposite the Lower East Side.

Hillman Houses is specifically in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which is in the southern part of Manhattan.

The Lower East Side is south of, say, 14th Street, which is roughly the dividing line between downtown and midtown. Lower Manhattan is the southern tip.

Now, Williamsburg, Brooklyn: it's north of neighborhoods like Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant, and south of Greenpoint. But in terms of latitude, since it's directly across from the Lower East Side, it should be at a similar latitude.

I should look up the approximate latitudes.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I might not have real-time data, but I can use general knowledge.

The southern tip of Manhattan is around 40.70°N latitude. The Lower East Side is around 40.72°N to 40.73°N, I think. Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is at approximately 40.71°N to 40.72°N.

I remember that the Williamsburg Bridge connects the Lower East Side of Manhattan to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The bridge is roughly horizontal, meaning that the areas it connects are at about the same latitude.

Therefore, Williamsburg and the Lower East Side are at similar latitudes; one is not significantly north or south of the other; they are roughly east-west of each other.

Hillman Houses is in the Lower East Side, so it should be at the same latitude as the part of Williamsburg across the river.

But the question is about Williamsburg, Manhattan. That says "Manhattan", but Williamsburg is not in Manhattan. That might be a typo or misnomer.

Perhaps the user meant Williamsburg in Brooklyn but wrote "Manhattan" by mistake. Or maybe there is a place called Williamsburg in Manhattan? I don't think so. Williamsburg is firmly in Brooklyn.

Another thought: there is a Williamsburg Bridge, but that's a bridge, not a neighborhood in Manhattan.

I think it's safe to assume that "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" is an error, and it should be Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Similarly, "HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan" is correct; it's in Manhattan.

So, comparing Williamsburg, Brooklyn to Hillman Houses, Manhattan.

Now, to determine if Williamsburg is south of Hillman Houses.

Since they are on opposite sides of the river but connected by a bridge that runs east-west, they should be at approximately the same latitude.

For example, let's take specific points.

Hillman Houses is located at 40.7136° N, 73.9814° W, I believe. I might not have exact coordinates, but roughly.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn, say around Bedford Avenue, might be 40.714° N, 73.957° W or something like that.

Actually, upon thinking, Williamsburg is a bit north of the southern part of the Lower East Side.

Let me think about streets. In Manhattan, the Lower East Side is roughly from Houston Street down to the Manhattan Bridge or so. Houston Street is at about 40.726° N, and further south, say Delancey Street, is around 40.718° N.

Hillman Houses is on Pitt Street, which is between East Broadway and Grand Street, I think. Grand Street is around 40.715° N.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has its main area around Grand Street and Bedford Avenue, which is also around 40.714° N or so.

The Williamsburg Bridge connects from Delancey Street in Manhattan to Williamsburg in Brooklyn. Delancey Street is at approximately 40.718° N.

In Brooklyn, the bridge lands around Marcy Avenue, which is at a similar latitude.

So, the areas immediately adjacent to the bridge are at the same latitude.

Hillman Houses is on the Lower East Side, near the waterfront. Pitt Street is between Cherry Street and the East River, near the Manhattan Bridge.

The Manhattan Bridge is a bit south of the Williamsburg Bridge. The Williamsburg Bridge is north of the Manhattan Bridge.

Let's order the bridges from north to south:

- Williamsburg Bridge: around 40.713° N? I need better recall.

Standard latitude reference: let's take 40.7° as the southern tip.

- Brooklyn Bridge: south end around 40.705° N, but it spans.

Bridges:

- Williamsburg Bridge: approximately 40.712° N to 40.714° N

- Manhattan Bridge: approximately 40.708° N to 40.710° N? I think Manhattan Bridge is south of Williamsburg Bridge.

Actually, Williamsburg Bridge is the northernmost of the East River bridges connecting to Manhattan south of 14th Street.

From north to south:

- Williamsburg Bridge: connects to Delancey Street area, latitude about 40.715° N

- Manhattan Bridge: connects to Canal Street and Chinatown, latitude about 40.710° N

- Brooklyn Bridge: connects to City Hall, latitude about 40.708° N

Delancey Street is at 40.718° N? I think I have conflicting numbers.

Let me use a consistent source mentally. In Manhattan, streets increase in number as you go north.

Houston Street is the northern boundary of the Lower East Side, at about 40.726° N.

Delancey Street is south of Houston, around 40.718° N.

Grand Street is further south, around 40.715° N.

East Broadway is south of that, around 40.711° N.

Hillman Houses is at 75 Pitt Street, which is between Grand Street and East Broadway, so approximately 40.713° N.

Now, Williamsburg, Brooklyn: the neighborhood center, say at Bedford Avenue and North 7th Street, is around 40.717° N, which is slightly north of Delancey Street.

Williamsburg spans from about North 15th Street to the river, but the core is around North 7th to Grand Street.

Grand Street in Williamsburg is at the same latitude as Grand Street in Manhattan? No, streets are not continuous across boroughs.

In Brooklyn, Grand Street runs east-west and is at approximately 40.712° N to 40.714° N, similar to Manhattan.

But let's be precise.

The Williamsburg Bridge Manhattan side is at Delancey Street, 40.718° N.

The Brooklyn side is at Broadway and Driggs Avenue, also around 40.714° N to 40.716° N, roughly the same.

Now, Hillman Houses is at Pitt Street, which is south of Delancey. Pitt Street runs north-south from East Houston to Grand Street, so near Grand Street.

Pitt Street and Grand Street intersection is about 40.715° N.

Similarly, in Williamsburg, the area directly across might be slightly different, but generally, the waterfront areas align.

Williamsburg as a whole extends north to Greenpoint, but the southern part is near the bridge.

For practical purposes, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is at a latitude similar to the Lower East Side, perhaps slightly north or south depending on the exact spot.

But Hillman Houses is in the southern part of the Lower East Side, while Williamsburg has parts both north and south.

However, since the bridge connects at Delancey, and Hillman is south of that, Williamsburg might be slightly north.

Let's find the latitude of Hillman Houses.

I can reason that Pitt Street is near Rutgers Street and the Manhattan Bridge.

Manhattan Bridge is at Canal Street, which is 40.711° N.

Canal Street is 40.719° N? No.

Standard latitudes:

- 14th Street: 40.734° N

- Houston Street: 40.726° N

- Delancey Street: 40.718° N

- Grand Street: 40.715° N

- Canal Street: 40.719° N? Canal Street is north of Delancey? No.

Streets from north to south:

- 14th St: 40.734° N

- Houston St: 40.726° N (south of Houston is Lower East Side)

- Stanton St: around 40.722° N

- Rivington St: 40.720° N

- Delancey St: 40.718° N

- Broome St: 40.720° N? Broome is between Delancey and Grand.

Better to use:

- Delancey Street: approximately 40.718° N

- Grand Street: 40.715° N

- East Broadway: 40.711° N

Pitt Street runs from East Houston to Grand Street, so it covers from about 40.726° N to 40.715° N. But Hillman Houses is at 75 Pitt Street, which is between Grand and East Broadway, so closer to 40.713° N.

Now, Williamsburg, Brooklyn: the neighborhood is bounded roughly by the river, Flushing Avenue, Bushwick Avenue, and Division Avenue.

The latitude ranges from about 40.705° N (south near Broadway) to 40.725° N (north near McCarren Park).

But the core of Williamsburg is around Bedford Avenue and North 7th, which is about 40.717° N.

The Williamsburg Bridge connects at approximately 40.714° N on both sides.

Since Hillman Houses is at around 40.713° N, and the southern part of Williamsburg is near the bridge, let's say the area across from Hillman Houses might be around 40.713° N.

But Williamsburg as a whole has a northern part that is further north.

However, when we say "Williamsburg, Manhattan" – but it's not in Manhattan, so we have to take it as Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Perhaps the user is referring to a specific point, but I think for the purpose of this question, we should consider the general location.

Another idea: maybe "Williamsburg" is a typo and they mean something else, but I doubt it.

Perhaps there is a Williamsburg Houses in Manhattan? Williamsburg Houses is a public housing project in Brooklyn, not Manhattan.

Williamsburg Houses is in Brooklyn, in the Williamsburg neighborhood.

Hillman Houses is in Manhattan.

So, back to the comparison.

To answer if Williamsburg is south of Hillman Houses.

From above, Hillman Houses latitude is approximately 40.713° N.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn: the southern part, near the bridge, is about 40.712° N to 40.714° N, so similar.

The center of Williamsburg is around 40.717° N, which is north of 40.713° N.

40.717 > 40.713, so if Hillman is at 40.713 N, and central Williamsburg is at 40.717 N, then Williamsburg is north of Hillman Houses.

But the southern edge of Williamsburg might be south.

For example, near the Williamsburg Bridge on the Brooklyn side, it's around 40.714 N, similar to Delancey.

But Hillman Houses is at Pitt and Grand, which is about 40.715 N, and south of that.

Grand Street Manhattan is 40.715 N, and Pitt Street at Grand is the same.

In Brooklyn, Grand Street Williamsburg is at approximately 40.714 N, so slightly south.

40.714 vs 40.715, so Williamsburg Grand Street is slightly south of Manhattan Grand Street.

Similarly, Hillman Houses is on Pitt near Grand, so around 40.715 N.

In Williamsburg, the area directly east might be around 40.714 N.

So, 40.714 is less than 40.715, so it is slightly south.

But the difference is very small, like 0.001 degree, which is about 100 meters, so not significant.

But technically, since latitude decreases as you go south, 40.714 N is south of 40.715 N.

Therefore, parts of Williamsburg are slightly south of Hillman Houses, but not the whole neighborhood.

However, the question is "Is WILLIAMSBURG... located south of HILLMAN HOUSES?"

Since Williamsburg is a area, and its southern part is south, but the central part might not be.

Generally, when we say a neighborhood is south of another, we mean its geographic center or general position.

But in this case, since they are close, it's ambiguous.

But let's think about the context.

Hillman Houses is at a specific location, and Williamsburg is a neighborhood.

Perhaps for simplicity, we can say that Williamsburg is not south of Hillman Houses; they are roughly at the same latitude.

But the question asks for a yes or no, so I need to decide.

Another way: using the bridge as reference.

The Williamsburg Bridge is at about 40.714 N on both sides.

Hillman Houses is at Pitt Street, which is between Cherry Street and the river. Cherry Street is just west of the Manhattan Bridge.

Manhattan Bridge is at Canal Street, which is 40.711 N? Canal Street is at 40.719 N? I think I have a mistake.

Let's clarify Manhattan street latitudes.

From online knowledge (but since I can't search, from memory):

- 1st Street: 40.730 N

- Houston Street: 40.726 N (but Houston is 1st Street? No, streets start at 1st St above Houston.

In Manhattan, the grid starts at 5th Ave and Washington Square, with 1st St at 40.730 N.

- Houston Street: 40.726 N

- Stanton St: 40.723 N

- Rivington St: 40.721 N

- Delancey St: 40.718 N

- Broome St: 40.720 N? Broome is between Delancey and Spring.

Delancey is 40.718 N, Grand St is 40.715 N, Broome St is 40.720 N? No.

List from north to south:

- Houston St: 40.726 N

- Stanton St: 40.723 N (approximately)

- Rivington St: 40.721 N

- Delancey St: 40.718 N

- Broome St: 40.720 N? Broome should be north of Delancey? I think I'm confused.

Standard: Houston St is north, then 1st St is above Houston? No.

The Lower East Side streets:

North to south:

- East Houston Street: 40.726 N

- Stanton Street: 40.724 N (est)

- Rivington Street: 40.722 N

- Delancey Street: 40.718 N

- Broome Street: 40.720 N? Broome is parallel, but between Houston and Delancey.

Houston to Delancey, streets are: between them, e.g., Stanton, Rivington, then Delancey.

South of Delancey: Broome, Grand, etc.

Delancey St: 40.718 N

Broome St: 40.720 N? That can't be, Broome should be north of Delancey.

I think I have it.

Delancey Street is at 40.718 N.

South of Delancey is Broome Street at approximately 40.720 N? No, latitude decreases south, so south of Delancey should be lower latitude.

Latitude decreases as you go south.

So Houston St at 40.726 N

Then Stanton St at about 40.724 N

Rivington St at 40.722 N

Delancey St at 40.718 N

Then south of Delancey: Broome St at 40.720 N? 40.720 is higher than 40.718, which is north, so Broome must be north of Delancey.

I think Delancey is south of Broome.

Let's reset.

From north to south in LES:

- Houston Street: 40.726 N

- Stanton Street: 40.724 N (between Houston and Delancey)

- Rivington Street: 40.722 N

- Delancey Street: 40.718 N

- Broome Street: 40.720 N? Broome Street is actually north of Delancey? No, Broome is south of Delancey in some parts, but it's parallel.

Streets are not strictly ordered; they have east-west names.

Generally, from north to south:

- East Houston Street

- Stanton Street

- Rivington Street

- Delancey Street

- Broome Street (south of Delancey)

- Grand Street

- Broome Street is at 40.720 N, but if Delancey is 40.718, 40.720 is north, so Broome must be north of Delancey.

I think I have a mistake in numbers.

Upon better recollection, Delancey Street is at approximately 40.718 N, and Broome Street is at 40.720 N, which is slightly north, so Broome is north of Delancey.

But in Manhattan, Delancey is south of Houston, and Broome is between Houston and Delancey.

Houston: 40.726 N

Stanton: 40.724 N

Rivington: 40.722 N

Delancey: 40.718 N

Then south of Delancey: Grand Street at 40.715 N

Then Canal Street at 40.719 N? Canal Street is north of Delancey? No.

Canal Street is at the base of Manhattan Bridge, and it's at 40.715 N or so? Canal Street is around 40.719 N, which is north of Delancey's 40.718, but Delancey is 40.718, Canal is 40.719, so Canal is slightly north.

Canal Street is at 40.719 N, Delancey at 40.718 N, so Delancey is south of Canal.

Canal Street is the northern boundary of Chinatown, and Delancey is south.

Latitudes:

- Canal Street: 40.719 N

- Delancey Street: 40.718 N

- Broome Street: 40.720 N (north of Delancey)

- Grand Street: 40.715 N (south of Delancey)

- East Broadway: 40.711 N

Hillman Houses is at 75 Pitt Street. Pitt Street runs from East Houston to Grand Street, so from 40.726 N to 40.715 N. 75 Pitt Street is near Grand Street, so approximately 40.715 N.

In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the latitude at the Williamsburg Bridge is around 40.714 N on the Brooklyn side.

For example, the intersection of Broadway and Driggs Avenue is about 40.714 N.

The center of Williamsburg, like Bedford and N 7th, is 40.717 N.

So, the Williamsburg Bridge area is at 40.714 N, which is south of 40.715 N, so slightly south.

40.714 < 40.715, so yes, south.

But the neighborhood includes areas north.

However, for the purpose of this question, since the bridge connects and the areas are adjacent, Williamsburg is generally considered to be at the same latitude, but technically, the southern part is slightly south.

But let's see Hillman Houses specifically.

Hillman Houses is at 40.7136° N, based on online data if I recall, but roughly 40.714 N.

Similarly, Williamsburg, the southern part is 40.712 N, central 40.717 N.

But to be fair, the point directly opposite Hillman Houses across the river would be in Williamsburg at a similar latitude, but since the river is there, it's not part of Manhattan.

So, for the neighborhood, Williamsburg is not entirely south; it's mostly at the same latitude or slightly north.

But the question is "located south of", which might imply the position relative to each other.

Perhaps we can say that the geographic center of Williamsburg is north of Hillman Houses.

For example, the center of Williamsburg is around 40.717 N, Hillman at 40.714 N, so Williamsburg is north.

40.717 > 40.714, so north.

If we take the southern boundary, it might be south.

But I think for such questions, we consider the general location.

Moreover, in common parlance, Williamsburg is not described as south of the Lower East Side; it's east.

So, I think the answer should be no.

But let's confirm with the "Manhattan" part. The question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" which is incorrect, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Maybe the user means the Williamsburg Bridge or something, but it says "WILLIAMSBURG", which is a place.

Another possibility: there is a Williamsburg in Manhattan? I don't think so.

Or perhaps it's a historical reference, but I doubt it.

I think it's a mistake, and we should proceed with Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

So, to answer: Is Williamsburg, Brooklyn south of Hillman Houses, Manhattan?

Based on latitude, Hillman Houses is at about 40.714 N, Williamsburg center at 40.717 N, so Williamsburg is north, not south.

Even the southern part of Williamsburg is around 40.712 N, which is south of 40.714, but since Hillman is at 40.714, and 40.712 is south, so parts are south, but the neighborhood as a whole is not.

But for a yes/no question, I think the expected answer is no, because they are at similar latitudes, and Williamsburg is not distinctly south.

Moreover, in terms of boroughs, Brooklyn is not south of Manhattan; Manhattan's southern tip is south of parts of Brooklyn.

But Williamsburg is in northern Brooklyn, so it is north of the southern tip of Manhattan.

Hillman Houses is in Lower Manhattan, so south.

But compared to each other.

I think I'm overcomplicating.

Step by step reasoning:

1. Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not in Manhattan. So "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" is likely a mistake, and we assume it's Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

2. Hillman Houses is a housing development in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

3. The Lower East Side is in southern Manhattan, approximately between latitudes 40.71 N and 40.73 N.

4. Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is directly east of the Lower East Side, across the East River.

5. The Williamsburg Bridge connects the two areas at approximately the same latitude, around 40.714 N.

6. Hillman Houses is located at Pitt Street near Grand Street, which is about 40.715 N latitude.

7. The core of Williamsburg is around 40.717 N latitude, which is north of 40.715 N.

8. Therefore, Williamsburg is generally north of Hillman Houses, not south.

9. Some southern parts of Williamsburg may be slightly south of Hillman Houses, but the neighborhood as a whole is not considered south of it.

10. Thus, the answer should be No.

Final answer: No

The question is "located south of", so for the location, it's not south.

Yes.
*********************************** End of Thinking ************************************




**************************************** Content ***************************************
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations:**
   - **Williamsburg**: This is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City. It is not located in Manhattan. The query mentions "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," but this appears to be a mistake, as Williamsburg is definitively in Brooklyn. I will proceed with Williamsburg, Brooklyn, as the intended location.
   - **Hillman Houses**: This is a public housing development located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, specifically at 75 Pitt Street, New York, NY 10002. It is correctly situated in Manhattan.

2. **Geographical orientation:**
   - Manhattan and Brooklyn are adjacent boroughs, with Manhattan lying to the west of Brooklyn, separated by the East River.
   - The Lower East Side of Manhattan (where Hillman Houses is located) is in the southern part of Manhattan, roughly bounded by Houston Street to the north and the Manhattan Bridge to the south.
   - Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is directly east of the Lower East Side, across the East River. It is connected to Manhattan by the Williamsburg Bridge.

3. **Latitude comparison:**
   - Latitude measures north-south position, with lower latitudes being farther south.
   - **Hillman Houses**: Located at approximately 40.714°N latitude (based on its address near Pitt and Grand Streets).
   - **Williamsburg, Brooklyn**: The neighborhood spans a range of latitudes, but its core (e.g., around Bedford Avenue and North 7th Street) is at approximately 40.717°N. The southern edge (near the Williamsburg Bridge) is around 40.714°N, similar to the bridge itself.
   - Comparing key points:
     - Hillman Houses: ~40.714°N
     - Williamsburg core: ~40.717°N (north of Hillman Houses)
     - Williamsburg southern edge: ~40.714°N (same as Hillman Houses) or slightly lower (e.g., ~40.712°N in some areas), but this is not representative of the neighborhood as a whole.

4. **Analysis of "south of":**
   - For Williamsburg to be south of Hillman Houses, its typical or central location should have a lower latitude than Hillman Houses.
   - Williamsburg's central latitude (40.717°N) is higher than Hillman Houses' latitude (40.714°N), meaning Williamsburg is north of Hillman Houses.
   - While the southernmost part of Williamsburg may be slightly south of Hillman Houses (e.g., near the waterfront at ~40.712°N), this is a minor area and does not define the neighborhood's general location. Geographically, Williamsburg is considered to be at the same latitude or slightly north of the Lower East Side.
   - The Williamsburg Bridge, which connects the two areas, runs roughly east-west, indicating that the connected points are at similar latitudes, not with one significantly south of the other.

5. **Conclusion based on overall position:**
   - Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is not located south of Hillman Houses, Manhattan. Instead, it is primarily east and slightly north of it. The two areas are at roughly the same latitude due to their proximity across the East River, but Williamsburg as a neighborhood is not positioned to the south.

**Final Answer: No**
