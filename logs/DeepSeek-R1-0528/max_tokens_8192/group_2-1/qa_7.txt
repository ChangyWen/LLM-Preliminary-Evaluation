*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is a cheetah faster than a lion?" I need to provide a step-by-step reasoning process and end with a final answer of Yes or No.

I recall that cheetahs are known for being the fastest land animals. Lions are also fast, but I think cheetahs are faster.

Key points about cheetah speed:
- Cheetahs can run up to speeds of around 60 to 70 miles per hour (mph) in short bursts. I think the top speed is often cited as 70 mph or even a bit higher.
- They can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just a few seconds, like 3 to 4 seconds.

Now, for lions:
- Lions are powerful but not as fast as cheetahs.
- I think lions can run up to about 50 mph, but I'm not entirely sure. I should look this up in my knowledge base.

Since I'm an AI, I have access to general knowledge. From what I know:
- Cheetah top speed: approximately 70-75 mph (112-120 km/h).
- Lion top speed: approximately 50 mph (80 km/h).

So, based on that, cheetahs are faster.

But let's confirm the reasoning step by step.

Step 1: Identify the top speeds.
- Cheetah: The fastest land animal, capable of speeds up to 70-75 mph in short sprints.
- Lion: A large cat, but built for strength and endurance rather than pure speed. Top speed is around 50 mph.

Step 2: Compare the speeds.
- 70 mph (cheetah) vs. 50 mph (lion) – that's a significant difference. Cheetah is about 20 mph faster.

Step 3: Consider other factors.
- Cheetahs are sprinters; they can only maintain top speed for short distances, like 20-30 seconds.
- Lions might have more endurance, but for top speed comparison, we're looking at maximum capability.
- The question is about who is faster, so top speed is the key metric.

Step 4: Final answer should be based on this comparison.

Is there any scenario where a lion might be faster? I don't think so. Lions are faster than humans, but not compared to cheetahs.

Also, in terms of hunting, cheetahs rely on speed to catch prey like gazelles, while lions use teamwork and ambush.

So, unequivocally, cheetahs are faster.

Final answer: Yes.

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)." So I need to present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether a cheetah is faster than a lion. This requires comparing the top speeds of both animals.

2. **Recall Key Facts about Cheetahs**:
   - Cheetahs are widely recognized as the fastest land animals on Earth.
   - Their top speed is achieved in short bursts during a chase, typically reaching **60–75 miles per hour (mph)** or **97–120 kilometers per hour (km/h)**.
   - This speed is possible due to their lightweight build, long legs, flexible spine, and specialized adaptations like non-retractable claws for traction.

3. **Recall Key Facts about Lions**:
   - Lions are powerful predators but are not built for extreme speed. They rely more on strength, teamwork, and ambush tactics for hunting.
   - Their top speed is around **50 mph (80 km/h)** in short sprints, but they can sustain this for only a short distance.
   - Lions are heavier and more muscular than cheetahs, which limits their acceleration and top speed.

4. **Compare the Speeds**:
   - Cheetah top speed: **Up to 75 mph (120 km/h)**.
   - Lion top speed: **Up to 50 mph (80 km/h)**.
   - Based on these values, the cheetah's top speed is significantly higher—about 25 mph (40 km/h) faster than the lion's.

5. **Consider Context**:
   - Speed is often measured in short bursts for both animals, as neither can maintain top speed for long. However, cheetahs are specialized sprinters, while lions focus on endurance over shorter distances.
   - In real-world scenarios, such as hunting, cheetahs use their speed to catch agile prey like gazelles, whereas lions use stealth and cooperation. This reinforces that cheetahs are evolutionarily optimized for speed.

6. **Address Potential Misconceptions**:
   - Some might think lions are faster due to their size and power, but data shows this is not the case. Lions are faster than humans (average human sprint speed is about 15–20 mph) but slower than cheetahs.
   - All credible sources, such as wildlife organizations and scientific studies, confirm that cheetahs hold the land speed record.

7. **Conclusion**: Since the cheetah's top speed exceeds the lion's by a substantial margin, the cheetah is faster.

**Final Answer: Yes**
