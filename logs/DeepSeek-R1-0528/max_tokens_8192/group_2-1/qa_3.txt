*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Did Albert Einstein die later than Isaac Newton?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to recall the death dates of both scientists.

Starting with Isaac Newton: He was born in 1643 and died in 1727. I think he died on March 31, 1727. But I should confirm that.

Now, Albert Einstein: He was born in 1879 and died in 1955. I believe he died on April 18, 1955.

So, let's write down the death years:

- Isaac Newton: 1727

- Albert Einstein: 1955

1955 is later than 1727, right? Because 1955 comes after 1727 in the timeline.

But to be thorough, I should consider the exact dates, not just the years, because if they died in the same year, the month and day would matter. But here, the years are different and far apart, so the year alone should suffice.

1727 vs. 1955: 1955 is clearly after 1727. For example, 1727 is in the 18th century, and 1955 is in the 20th century.

Just to double-check:

- Isaac Newton died in 1727.

- Albert Einstein died in 1955.

Yes, 1955 is 228 years after 1727. So, Einstein died much later.

The question is "did Albert Einstein die later than Isaac Newton?" Since Einstein died in 1955 and Newton in 1727, Einstein died later.

But let me make sure I have the correct dates.

I recall: Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643, and died on March 31, 1727. (Sometimes dates are given in the Julian calendar, but for death dates, it should be fine.)

Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, and died on April 18, 1955.

So, death dates:

- Newton: March 31, 1727

- Einstein: April 18, 1955

Comparing 1955 to 1727, 1955 is greater than 1727, so Einstein died later.

Since the years are different, the month and day don't affect the comparison because 1955 is after 1727.

If they died in the same year, I'd need the full date, but here it's not necessary.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The question is straightforward, but I need to show step-by-step reasoning.

Step 1: Recall the death year of Isaac Newton.

- Isaac Newton died in 1727.

Step 2: Recall the death year of Albert Einstein.

- Albert Einstein died in 1955.

Step 3: Compare the years.

- 1955 is greater than 1727, meaning 1955 comes after 1727 in the calendar.

Therefore, Albert Einstein died later than Isaac Newton.

Final answer: Yes.

I think that's it. No tricks here.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Isaac Newton's death date:**
   - Isaac Newton, the English physicist and mathematician, died on March 31, 1727. (Source: Historical records, such as those from the Royal Society or Encyclopedia Britannica.)

2. **Identify Albert Einstein's death date:**
   - Albert Einstein, the German-born physicist, died on April 18, 1955. (Source: Historical records, such as those from the Einstein Archives or reputable biographies.)

3. **Compare the death years:**
   - Newton died in 1727, which is in the 18th century.
   - Einstein died in 1955, which is in the 20th century.
   - Since 1955 is numerically greater than 1727, Einstein died after Newton.

4. **Consider the full dates for precision:**
   - Even though the years are centuries apart, comparing the exact dates confirms the result:
     - Newton: March 31, 1727
     - Einstein: April 18, 1955
   - 1955 is clearly later than 1727, so the specific months and days do not change the outcome.

5. **Conclusion based on the comparison:**
   - Einstein's death in 1955 occurred after Newton's death in 1727 by 228 years.

**Final Answer: Yes**
