*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the Sahara Desert hotter than the Gobi Desert?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the Sahara Desert is in Africa, and it's the largest hot desert in the world. The Gobi Desert is in Asia, covering parts of northern China and southern Mongolia. Both are deserts, but they have different climates.

Now, to compare their temperatures, I should look at average temperatures, especially during the hottest months, since we're talking about which one is hotter.

I recall that the Sahara is known for extreme heat. For example, in places like Timbuktu or Death Valley (though Death Valley is in the Mojave, not Sahara, but similar idea), temperatures can exceed 50°C (122°F) in summer. The Sahara has very high temperatures due to its location near the equator, low humidity, and clear skies.

The Gobi Desert, on the other hand, is a cold desert. It has hot summers but also very cold winters because it's at a higher latitude and elevation. So, while it can get hot, it's not as consistently hot as the Sahara.

Let me think about specific temperature data.

For the Sahara:

- Average high temperatures in summer (July) can be around 38-40°C (100-104°F), but it can reach up to 50°C (122°F) in some areas.

- For instance, in Al Aziziyah, Libya, which is in the Sahara, it once recorded one of the highest temperatures on Earth at 58°C (136°F), but that's disputed. Generally, summer highs are very high.

For the Gobi:

- In summer, temperatures can reach 40°C (104°F), but average highs are lower. For example, in Ulaanbaatar, which is near the Gobi, but not exactly in it, summers are warm but not extreme.

Actually, Ulaanbaatar is in Mongolia, but it's a steppe, not the desert. Better to look at specific Gobi locations.

Dalandzadgad in Mongolia is in the Gobi. I think average July high is around 31°C (88°F), but I'm not sure.

I should rely on general knowledge or averages.

I remember that the Sahara has higher average annual temperatures and higher peak temperatures compared to the Gobi.

The Gobi is classified as a cold desert because of its temperature range; it has a continental climate with hot summers and frigid winters.

The Sahara has a more consistent hot climate, especially in the central and southern parts.

Also, latitude plays a role. The Sahara is between about 15°N and 30°N, so it's closer to the equator, receiving more direct sunlight year-round.

The Gobi is around 40°N to 50°N, so it's farther from the equator, meaning less intense sunlight and more seasonal variation.

Elevation: The Gobi is at a higher elevation, around 1000 meters on average, which can make it cooler. The Sahara has low-lying areas, but also some highlands, but generally lower elevation.

For example, the Qattara Depression in Sahara is below sea level, while the Gobi has the Altai Mountains nearby.

But for temperature comparison, we should focus on the desert basins.

Let me try to find some temperature records.

I know that the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth was in the Sahara, like in Kebili, Tunisia, or El Azizia, Libya, though those are debated. The current official record is Death Valley at 56.7°C (134°F), but Sahara has similar extremes.

For Gobi, I think the highest recorded temperature is around 45°C (113°F) or so, which is high but less than Sahara's peaks.

But for the question, it might be about average temperatures, not extremes.

The question says "hotter," which could mean higher average temperatures or higher maximum temperatures. I think it's generally about which one is warmer overall.

Perhaps I should compare average summer temperatures.

Let me recall:

- Sahara: Average July temperature can be 35-40°C (95-104°F) in many parts.

- Gobi: Average July temperature is around 25-30°C (77-86°F) for most areas, with some spots reaching higher.

For example, in the Gobi Desert, places like Hami in China have average highs of 36°C (97°F) in July, but that's on the edge.

Generally, the Gobi has lower averages.

Also, annual mean temperature: Sahara is higher.

For instance, Sahara annual mean might be 25-30°C, while Gobi is 5-10°C or so, because of the cold winters.

But the question is about "hotter," which probably refers to summer heat or peak temperatures.

In common parlance, when we say a desert is hot, we mean during the day in summer.

So, let's compare maximum temperatures.

Based on climate data:

Sahara Desert:

- Average high in summer: 38-45°C (100-113°F)

- Record high: over 50°C (122°F)

Gobi Desert:

- Average high in summer: 30-38°C (86-100°F), with some variation.

- Record high: about 45°C (113°F)

So, Sahara tends to be hotter on average and has higher extremes.

Another way: the Sahara is a subtropical desert, while the Gobi is a cold winter desert.

Deserts are classified based on temperature; hot deserts like Sahara, Arabian, etc., and cold deserts like Gobi, Patagonian, etc.

So, by definition, the Sahara is a hot desert, and the Gobi is a cold desert, meaning the Sahara is hotter.

But let's confirm with data.

I can think about personal experiences or common knowledge. Most people would say the Sahara is hotter.

For accuracy, let's see if there's any source.

Since I'm an AI, I can access general knowledge up to my training data.

According to what I know:

- The Sahara has one of the highest average temperatures for deserts.

- The Gobi has a greater temperature range, but lower averages.

For example, in Dalanzadgad, Mongolia (Gobi Desert):

- July average high: 31°C (88°F)

- January average low: -25°C (-13°F)

Whereas in In Salah, Algeria (Sahara):

- July average high: 46°C (115°F)

- January average low: 10°C (50°F)

Big difference.

Even in Cairo, which is not deep Sahara but on the edge, July average high is 34°C (93°F), but deeper in, it's hotter.

For Gobi, a place like Ejin Banner in Inner Mongolia might have similar summer highs, but overall, Sahara is hotter.

Another point: the Gobi can be hot, but it's not as persistently hot as the Sahara.

Therefore, yes, the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert.

Final answer should be Yes.

But let me make sure there's no trick.

Is there any part of Gobi that is hotter than parts of Sahara? Probably not, on average.

Sahara has areas like the Libyan Desert with extreme heat.

Gobi has cooler summers due to latitude and elevation.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the deserts: Sahara in North Africa, Gobi in East Asia.

2. Consider geographic factors: Sahara near equator, lower latitude; Gobi at higher latitude, higher elevation.

3. Climate classification: Sahara is hot desert, Gobi is cold desert.

4. Temperature data: Sahara has higher average summer temperatures and higher record temperatures.

5. Conclusion: Sahara is hotter.

Therefore, the answer is Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert. "Hotter" likely refers to higher average temperatures during the hottest periods (e.g., summer) or higher peak temperatures, as deserts can have significant seasonal variations.

2. **Geographic and Climatic Context**:
   - **Sahara Desert**: Located in North Africa, it is the world's largest hot desert. It lies primarily between 15°N and 30°N latitude, which is closer to the equator. This results in intense, direct sunlight year-round, low humidity, and minimal cloud cover. The Sahara is classified as a subtropical desert, known for extremely high temperatures.
   - **Gobi Desert**: Located in East Asia (covering parts of northern China and southern Mongolia), it is a cold desert. It lies at higher latitudes (40°N to 50°N) and has a higher average elevation (around 1,000 meters or 3,300 feet). This contributes to a continental climate with large temperature swings—hot summers but very cold winters. It is classified as a cold winter desert due to its significant seasonal extremes.

3. **Temperature Comparison**:
   - **Average Summer High Temperatures**: This is a key metric for determining which desert is "hotter" during peak heat.
     - Sahara: Average high temperatures in summer (July) range from **38°C to 45°C (100°F to 113°F)** in most areas. For example:
       - In Salah, Algeria: Average July high is **46°C (115°F)**.
       - Timbuktu, Mali: Average July high is **40°C (104°F)**.
     - Gobi: Average high temperatures in summer (July) are lower, ranging from **25°C to 35°C (77°F to 95°F)**. For example:
       - Dalanzadgad, Mongolia (central Gobi): Average July high is **31°C (88°F)**.
       - Ejin Banner, China (eastern Gobi): Average July high is **36°C (97°F)**, but this is an exception near the desert's edge.
     - **Conclusion**: The Sahara consistently has higher average summer highs, often by 5–10°C (9–18°F), due to its lower latitude and more intense solar radiation.
   
   - **Peak Recorded Temperatures**: Extreme highs indicate the upper limits of heat.
     - Sahara: Record highs exceed **50°C (122°F)** in multiple locations (e.g., 55°C/131°F in Kebili, Tunisia, though some records are debated). The Sahara frequently experiences temperatures above 45°C (113°F) in summer.
     - Gobi: Record highs are generally lower, around **40–45°C (104–113°F)** (e.g., 45°C/113°F recorded in parts of Inner Mongolia). The Gobi's higher elevation and latitude limit its peak temperatures compared to the Sahara.
     - **Conclusion**: The Sahara has higher extreme temperatures, reinforcing that it is hotter.

   - **Annual Mean Temperatures**: While not the focus for "hotter" (which emphasizes peak heat), this shows overall warmth.
     - Sahara: Annual mean temperatures range from **25°C to 30°C (77°F to 86°F)** due to consistently high year-round temperatures.
     - Gobi: Annual mean temperatures are much lower, around **3°C to 10°C (37°F to 50°F)**, because of bitterly cold winters (e.g., January averages can drop to -20°C/-4°F).
     - **Conclusion**: The Sahara's climate is more uniformly hot, while the Gobi has a broader range with cold seasons, making it less hot on average.

4. **Key Factors Influencing Heat**:
   - **Latitude**: The Sahara's proximity to the equator allows for more direct and consistent solar radiation. The Gobi's higher latitude reduces solar intensity.
   - **Elevation**: The Gobi's average elevation (1,000–1,500 meters) contributes to cooler temperatures, while much of the Sahara is at lower elevations (e.g., the Qattara Depression is below sea level), trapping heat.
   - **Climate Type**: The Sahara is a "hot desert" under the Köppen classification, while the Gobi is a "cold desert," defined by its temperature extremes and colder winters.

5. **Overall Assessment**: Based on average summer highs, peak temperatures, and climatic classification, the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert. The Gobi can experience high temperatures, but they are generally lower and less sustained than in the Sahara.

**Final Answer: Yes**
