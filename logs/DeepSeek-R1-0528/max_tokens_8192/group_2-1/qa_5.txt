*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Russia larger in area than Australia?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Russia is the largest country in the world by land area, and Australia is also quite large, but I think Russia is bigger. Let me confirm the actual areas.

I recall that Russia's total area is about 17 million square kilometers. Specifically, I think it's 17,098,246 square kilometers. For Australia, I think it's around 7.7 million square kilometers. Australia includes the mainland and some islands, but I believe it's smaller than Russia.

Let me double-check these figures. I should use reliable sources or common knowledge.

From memory:

- Russia: approximately 17.1 million km²

- Australia: approximately 7.692 million km²

Yes, that seems right. But let me be precise.

I think Russia spans across Europe and Asia, covering a vast area from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean. Australia is a continent-country, mostly desert and has a smaller landmass.

Now, to be thorough, I should compare the official areas.

I remember that the United Nations or CIA World Factbook has these statistics.

According to the CIA World Factbook:

- Russia: total area 17,098,242 km²

- Australia: total area 7,741,220 km²? Wait, that might include water areas or something. I need land area specifically.

The question says "area," which probably means total area, including land and water, but for country comparisons, it's usually the total area.

For Australia, the land area is smaller because it has a lot of coast, but total area includes territorial waters sometimes? I need to clarify.

Typically, when comparing country sizes, we use total area: land plus inland water bodies, but excluding territorial waters beyond the coast.

Let me think.

For Russia, total area is about 17.1 million km², with land around 16.4 million km² or something, but I think the standard comparison is total area.

Similarly, for Australia, total area is about 7.692 million km² land, and including water, it might be different, but I think the figure I have is for land area.

Perhaps I should look for consistent sources.

I can reason based on ranks: Russia is 1st, and Australia is 6th or 7th.

List of countries by area:

1. Russia: ~17.1 million km²

2. Canada: ~9.98 million km²

3. China: ~9.6 million km²? Wait, no, China is about 9.7, but including disputed areas.

Better to use standard figures.

Canada is second with about 9.984 million km².

Then United States is about 9.833 million km² including territories.

China is about 9.6 million km².

Brazil is about 8.5 million km².

Australia is about 7.692 million km² land area.

Yes, so Australia is sixth after Brazil, I think.

Countries larger than Australia: Russia, Canada, China, USA, Brazil. So Australia is 6th.

Russia is 1st with 17.1 million km², which is more than double Australia's 7.7 million km².

17.1 vs 7.7, so Russia is larger.

To be precise:

Russia area: 17,098,242 km² (source: Wikipedia or CIA Factbook)

Australia area: 7,692,024 km² (land area, but total area might be similar as it's mostly land)

Australia includes external territories, but the main land area is about 7.692 million km².

Total area for Australia is often listed as 7,741,220 km² including coastal waters, but for country size comparison, it's usually the land area that matters.

I think the standard is to use total area as defined by the country.

But in any case, Russia is significantly larger.

Let me calculate the difference.

17,098,242 minus 7,692,024 = 9,406,218 km². So Russia is larger by about 9.4 million km², which is itself larger than Australia.

Therefore, Russia is larger than Australia.

But the question is straightforward, and I think I'm overcomplicating it.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. I recall that Russia is the largest country in the world by land area.

2. Australia is the sixth largest country by land area.

3. Therefore, since Russia is larger than all other countries, it must be larger than Australia.

To be more detailed:

- The land area of Russia is approximately 17.1 million square kilometers.

- The land area of Australia is approximately 7.7 million square kilometers.

- Since 17.1 > 7.7, Russia has a larger area than Australia.

For accuracy:

Exact figures from a reliable source: I can use the CIA World Factbook data.

CIA World Factbook:

- Russia: total area: 17,098,242 sq km

- Australia: total area: 7,741,220 sq km (this includes Lord Howe Island and Macquarie Island, but it's the official area)

But 7,741,220 is less than 17,098,242.

Even if we consider land area only:

- Russia land area: about 16,376,870 sq km? I think the total area includes inland waters.

Standard total area for Russia is 17,098,242 km² including land and water.

For Australia, total area is 7,741,220 km², which includes land and inland waters.

But Australia's land area alone is 7,682,300 km² or something. Still, 7.7 million vs 17.1 million.

7,741,220 < 17,098,242, so Russia is larger.

Another source: United Nations data.

But I think it's consistent.

Therefore, Russia is larger in area than Australia.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question is: "Is Russia larger in area than Australia?" So Yes.

But to present it:

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Step 1: Identify the areas of both countries.

  - Russia's total area: approximately 17,098,242 square kilometers.

  - Australia's total area: approximately 7,741,220 square kilometers.

- Step 2: Compare the two areas.

  - 17,098,242 > 7,741,220

- Step 3: Conclude that Russia has a larger area than Australia.

Final Answer: Yes

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether Russia is larger in area than Australia. This requires comparing the total land area (including inland water bodies) of both countries.

2. **Recall Key Facts**: 
   - Russia is widely recognized as the largest country in the world by total area.
   - Australia is the sixth-largest country by total area.
   - To answer precisely, I need the specific area figures for both countries.

3. **Source of Data**: I will use reliable and commonly accepted sources for area measurements, such as the CIA World Factbook or the United Nations Statistics Division, which provide standardized data for country comparisons. These sources report total area, including land and inland water bodies (e.g., lakes, rivers), but excluding coastal and territorial waters.

4. **Area of Russia**:
   - According to the CIA World Factbook, Russia's total area is **17,098,242 square kilometers**.
   - This figure includes land and inland water bodies across its vast territory spanning Eastern Europe and Northern Asia.

5. **Area of Australia**:
   - According to the CIA World Factbook, Australia's total area is **7,741,220 square kilometers**.
   - This includes the Australian mainland, Tasmania, and other smaller islands under its sovereignty, plus inland water bodies.

6. **Numerical Comparison**:
   - Compare the two areas directly:
     - Russia: 17,098,242 km²
     - Australia: 7,741,220 km²
   - Calculate the difference: 17,098,242 - 7,741,220 = 9,357,022 km².
   - Since 17,098,242 is greater than 7,741,220, Russia has a larger area.

7. **Contextual Verification**:
   - Russia's area (17.1 million km²) is more than double Australia's area (7.7 million km²).
   - In global country size rankings:
     - Russia ranks 1st.
     - Australia ranks 6th.
   - This confirms that Russia is larger than all other countries, including Australia.

8. **Conclusion**: Based on the data and comparison, Russia is indeed larger in area than Australia.

**Final Answer: Yes**
