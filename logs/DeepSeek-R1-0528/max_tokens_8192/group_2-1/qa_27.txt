*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the melting point of ice lower than the boiling point of water?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the melting point of ice is the temperature at which ice turns into water. For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, that's 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

The boiling point of water is the temperature at which water turns into steam. At standard atmospheric pressure, that's 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

So, comparing 0 degrees Celsius to 100 degrees Celsius, 0 is less than 100. Therefore, the melting point is lower than the boiling point.

I should confirm the units. The question doesn't specify units, but in science, we usually use Celsius for such comparisons. Also, in Kelvin, melting point is 273 K and boiling point is 373 K, so 273 < 373, same thing.

Is there any condition where this might not be true? For example, under different pressures, the melting and boiling points can change. But the question doesn't mention any specific conditions, so I think we assume standard conditions, like sea level pressure.

The melting point of ice is generally lower under high pressure, but it's still around 0°C for practical purposes. Similarly, boiling point decreases with lower pressure. But again, for this question, it's probably about standard values.

The question says "ice" and "water," implying pure water under normal conditions.

So, step by step:

1. Identify the melting point of ice: 0°C.

2. Identify the boiling point of water: 100°C.

3. Compare: 0°C < 100°C.

Therefore, yes, the melting point of ice is lower than the boiling point of water.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question asks to show step-by-step reasoning and then the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the key terms:**
   - The **melting point** of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from a solid to a liquid.
   - The **boiling point** of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a gas.
   - Here, we are comparing the melting point of ice (solid water) to the boiling point of liquid water.

2. **Recall standard values:**
   - Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.3 kPa), which is the typical condition for such comparisons unless specified otherwise:
     - The melting point of ice is **0°C (32°F or 273 K)**.
     - The boiling point of water is **100°C (212°F or 373 K)**.

3. **Compare the temperatures:**
   - Using the Celsius scale for simplicity (as it is commonly used for water):
     - 0°C (melting point) vs. 100°C (boiling point).
     - Since 0 is less than 100, the melting point is lower numerically.
   - This holds true in other scales:
     - Fahrenheit: 32°F < 212°F.
     - Kelvin: 273 K < 373 K.

4. **Consider any potential exceptions:**
   - Pressure can affect both melting and boiling points. For example:
     - Lower pressure (e.g., at high altitudes) reduces the boiling point of water (e.g., below 100°C).
     - Higher pressure can slightly lower the melting point of ice (e.g., due to the regelation effect), but it remains close to 0°C under normal conditions.
   - However, the question does not specify any non-standard conditions, so we assume standard atmospheric pressure. Under these conditions, the relationship remains consistent.

5. **Conclusion based on comparison:**
   - Since 0°C is less than 100°C, the melting point of ice is indeed lower than the boiling point of water.

**Final Answer:** Yes
