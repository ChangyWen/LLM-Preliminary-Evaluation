*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are comparing the length of a day on Venus and Earth.

 First, we need to define what a "day" means. There are two common definitions:
 1. Sidereal day: the time it takes for a planet to rotate once on its axis relative to the distant stars.
 2. Solar day: the time it takes for the Sun to appear in the same position in the sky (from noon to noon). This is what we typically use for a day.

 However, note that the question does not specify, but in common language, we usually refer to the solar day.

 But let's check the facts:

 For Earth:
   - Sidereal day: about 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds (which is 86164 seconds).
   - Solar day: exactly 24 hours (86400 seconds) by definition.

 For Venus:
   - Venus has a very slow rotation and also rotates in the opposite direction (retrograde rotation).
   - The sidereal rotation period of Venus (the time for one rotation relative to the fixed stars) is about 243 Earth days. This is longer than a Venusian year (about 225 Earth days).
   - However, because Venus rotates in the opposite direction and has a long rotation period, the solar day on Venus (the time from one noon to the next) is different.

 How to calculate the solar day on Venus?

 The formula for the solar day (T_solar) in terms of the sidereal rotation period (T_sidereal) and the orbital period (T_orbital) is:

   1 / T_solar = 1 / T_sidereal - 1 / T_orbital   (if the rotation is prograde)
   But note: Venus rotates retrograde. So we have to adjust the sign.

 For a planet with retrograde rotation, the formula becomes:

   1 / T_solar = -1 / T_sidereal - 1 / T_orbital   (if we consider prograde as positive and retrograde as negative)

 However, a more standard way is to think in terms of the angular speeds:

   Let:
     ω_sidereal = angular speed of rotation (positive for prograde, negative for retrograde)
     ω_orbital = angular speed of orbital motion (always positive in the same direction as prograde rotation)

   The angular speed of the Sun relative to the planet's surface is:
     ω_solar = ω_sidereal - ω_orbital

   But note: because of the retrograde rotation, ω_sidereal is negative.

   Then the solar day T_solar = 2π / |ω_solar|

   However, we can write:

     ω_solar = ω_sidereal - ω_orbital

   For Venus, the rotation is retrograde so ω_sidereal is negative. Therefore:

     ω_solar = (negative value) - (positive value) = even more negative.

   But the magnitude of the solar day is the absolute value of the period.

   Alternatively, we can use:

     T_solar = 1 / ( |1 / T_sidereal| + 1 / T_orbital )   [for retrograde rotation]

 Why? Because the solar day is shorter than the sidereal day for a prograde rotation (like Earth) but for a retrograde rotation, the solar day is shorter than the sidereal day? Actually, no. Let's think:

   In a retrograde rotation, the planet is rotating in the opposite direction to its orbit. So the Sun would appear to move faster? Actually, the solar day on Venus is less than the sidereal day.

   Actually, let me recall: the sidereal rotation period of Venus is 243 Earth days (which is the time for one rotation relative to the stars). The orbital period of Venus is about 224.7 Earth days.

   The solar day on Venus can be calculated by:

     T_solar = (T_sidereal * T_orbital) / (T_sidereal + T_orbital)   for a prograde planet? Wait, no.

   The general formula for the solar day (for both prograde and retrograde) is:

     T_solar = | (T_sidereal * T_orbital) / (T_sidereal ± T_orbital) |

   But for retrograde rotation, we use the plus sign? Actually, let's derive:

   In one solar day, the planet rotates by an angle of 360 degrees plus (for prograde) or minus (for retrograde) the angle it moves in its orbit during that day? Actually, the motion is relative.

   Alternatively, we can use the formula:

     1 / T_solar = | 1 / T_sidereal - 1 / T_orbital |   for prograde rotation? But for Venus we have to account for the retrograde.

   Actually, a better way is:

     T_solar = (T_sidereal * T_orbital) / | T_sidereal ∓ T_orbital |

   where the minus sign is for prograde and the plus sign for retrograde.

   Since Venus has retrograde rotation, we use:

     T_solar = (T_sidereal * T_orbital) / (T_sidereal + T_orbital)

   Why? Because the rotation is opposite to the orbital motion, so the relative motion is additive.

   Let me plug in the numbers:

     T_sidereal (Venus) = 243 Earth days (this is the sidereal rotation period, and note it's in Earth days)
     T_orbital (Venus) = 224.7 Earth days (approximate)

     T_solar (Venus) = (243 * 224.7) / (243 + 224.7) ≈ (243 * 224.7) / 467.7

     Calculate:

        243 * 224.7 ≈ 54620.1
        467.7
        T_solar ≈ 54620.1 / 467.7 ≈ 116.8 Earth days.

   But wait, I've seen sources that say the solar day on Venus is about 116.75 Earth days.

   So a day on Venus (solar day) is about 116.75 Earth days.

 Now, a day on Earth is 1 Earth day (24 hours).

 Therefore, 116.75 Earth days is much longer than 1 Earth day.

 Hence, a day on Venus is longer than a day on Earth.

 But wait, let's double-check the calculation:

     T_sidereal = 243.0185 Earth days (more precise value from NASA)
     T_orbital = 224.701 Earth days

     Then:

        T_solar = (243.0185 * 224.701) / (243.0185 + 224.701) 
                 = (54600.0) / (467.7195)   (approximately, using the given numbers)
                 ≈ 116.75 Earth days.

   So yes, the solar day on Venus is 116.75 Earth days.

   Therefore, a day on Venus (solar day) is longer than a day on Earth (1 Earth day).

   The answer is: Yes.

 However, note that sometimes the sidereal day is also considered. The sidereal day of Venus (243 Earth days) is also longer than a day on Earth.

 But the question is about a "day", which in common usage is the solar day. So we are comparing:

   Venus: 116.75 Earth days (solar day)
   Earth: 1 Earth day (solar day)

 So the day on Venus is much longer.

 Final Answer: Yes.

To determine if a day on Venus lasts longer than a day on Earth, we need to compare the length of a solar day on both planets. A solar day is the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky (from noon to noon), which is the common definition of a day.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Earth's Solar Day**:
   - Earth's solar day is exactly 24 hours, which is 1 Earth day.
   - This is the standard we use for comparison.

2. **Venus's Rotation and Orbit**:
   - Venus rotates on its axis very slowly and in the opposite direction (retrograde rotation) compared to most planets.
   - The sidereal rotation period (time for one rotation relative to distant stars) of Venus is approximately 243 Earth days.
   - Venus's orbital period (time to complete one orbit around the Sun) is approximately 225 Earth days.

3. **Calculating Venus's Solar Day**:
   - For a planet with retrograde rotation, the formula for the solar day (\(T_{\text{solar}}\)) is:
     \[
     T_{\text{solar}} = \frac{T_{\text{sidereal}} \times T_{\text{orbital}}}{T_{\text{sidereal}} + T_{\text{orbital}}}
     \]
     where:
     - \(T_{\text{sidereal}} = 243\) Earth days (sidereal rotation period),
     - \(T_{\text{orbital}} = 225\) Earth days (orbital period).
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     T_{\text{solar}} = \frac{243 \times 225}{243 + 225} = \frac{54675}{468} \approx 116.75 \text{ Earth days}.
     \]
   - Thus, one solar day on Venus is about 116.75 Earth days.

4. **Comparison**:
   - Earth's solar day: 1 Earth day.
   - Venus's solar day: 116.75 Earth days.
   - Since 116.75 > 1, a solar day on Venus is significantly longer than a solar day on Earth.

### Final Answer:
Yes
