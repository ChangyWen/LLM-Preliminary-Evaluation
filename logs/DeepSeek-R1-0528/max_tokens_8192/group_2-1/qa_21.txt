*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Japan located east of China?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that China and Japan are both countries in East Asia. China is a large country on the mainland, and Japan is an island nation to the east.

Let me recall some basic geography. China is located on the continent of Asia, with its eastern coast bordering the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea. Japan is a series of islands in the Pacific Ocean, east of the Asian mainland.

Specifically, Japan consists of several main islands: Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku. The closest part of Japan to China is probably Kyushu or the southern islands, which are near the Korean Peninsula and China.

China's easternmost point is around Shanghai or the Shandong Peninsula, and Japan's westernmost point is the island of Yonaguni, which is part of Okinawa Prefecture.

But to answer generally, Japan is east of China. Most maps show Japan to the east of China.

I should think in terms of longitude. The longitude can help determine east-west positioning.

China spans from about 73°E to 135°E longitude. For example, the westernmost point is around 73°E in Xinjiang, and the easternmost is around 135°E in Heilongjiang.

Japan's longitude: Tokyo is around 139°E, and the country spans from about 129°E to 146°E. For instance, Sapporo in Hokkaido is around 141°E, and Fukuoka in Kyushu is around 130°E.

Comparing to China: China's eastern coast is around 120°E to 125°E for major cities like Shanghai (121°E) and Beijing (116°E). Beijing is at about 116°E, Shanghai at 121°E.

Japan's westernmost point is Yonaguni Island at about 122°E or 123°E? Let me confirm.

Actually, Yonaguni is at approximately 123°E. And China's easternmost point is at the junction of the Amur and Ussuri rivers at about 135°E, but that's in the northeast. For the main part of China, near the coast, it's around 120°E to 122°E.

Shanghai is at 121.47°E, roughly.

Now, Japan: the main islands start from Kyushu. Fukuoka is at about 130.4°E, which is east of 121°E. Even Yonaguni, which is part of Japan, is at 122.93°E, which is still east of Shanghai's 121.47°E.

122.93°E vs 121.47°E – so Yonaguni is slightly east of Shanghai.

But is that accurate? Longitude increases as you go east, so 122.93°E is east of 121.47°E.

For example, 121°E to 122°E is a difference of about 1 degree, which is roughly 111 kilometers at the equator, but less at higher latitudes, but still, it's east.

However, Japan has islands further west? No, Yonaguni is the westernmost point of Japan.

What about the Senkaku Islands? They are disputed, but controlled by Japan, and they are at around 123°E to 124°E, which is east of Taiwan and China's coast.

Taiwan is part of China, but even then, Japan is east of Taiwan.

Taiwan's longitude: Taipei is at about 121.5°E, similar to Shanghai.

Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands) are at approximately 123°E to 124°E, so east of Taiwan and mainland China.

Therefore, all of Japan is east of China's eastern coast.

But let's consider the entire country. China extends further east in the northeast, near Russia.

For example, the city of Fuyuan in Heilongjiang is at about 134.5°E, which is quite far east.

Japan's easternmost point is Minami Torishima at about 153°E, but that's remote. The main islands go up to about 145°E.

Compared to Fuyuan at 134.5°E, Tokyo at 139°E is still east, but Hokkaido is around 141°E to 145°E, so yes, east.

But Fuyuan is in the northeast, while Japan is south of that, but in terms of longitude, Japan is still east of most of China.

Perhaps I should think directionally.

Generally, from China, Japan is to the east, across the East China Sea.

In fact, the East China Sea is between China and Japan, and Japan is east of it.

So, without overcomplicating, I think it's clear that Japan is located east of China.

Is there any part of China that is east of Japan? I don't think so. The easternmost point of China is about 135°E, and Japan starts from around 122°E to 153°E, so the western part of Japan overlaps in longitude with eastern China, but since Japan is to the east, it is still east of China.

For example, Yonaguni at 123°E is east of Shanghai at 121°E, but what about cities in eastern China that are further north? Like, Dalian is at about 121.6°E, similar.

But Japan's main islands are further east.

Perhaps I can consider the capital cities for simplicity.

Beijing, China: approximately 116°E

Tokyo, Japan: approximately 139°E

Since 139°E is greater than 116°E, Tokyo is east of Beijing.

Similarly, for Shanghai at 121°E, Tokyo at 139°E is still east.

Even the closest points: for example, from Shanghai to Nagasaki, Japan. Nagasaki is at about 129.87°E, Shanghai at 121.47°E, difference of about 8.4 degrees, which is roughly 930 km east (since 1 degree is about 111 km, but varies).

So, yes, Japan is east of China.

I think I'm overthinking it. Geographically and commonly, Japan is known to be east of China.

Final answer should be Yes.

But the question says "east of China." Is there any ambiguity?

China includes all its territories, like Taiwan, which is at about 120°E to 122°E, and Japan is east of that.

So, no issue.

Therefore, the answer is Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether Japan is located east of China. This requires a geographical comparison of their positions, primarily in terms of longitude, as east-west positioning is determined by longitudinal coordinates.

2. **Recall Basic Geography**:
   - China is a large country in East Asia, primarily on the Asian mainland. Its eastern coast borders the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, and the Pacific Ocean.
   - Japan is an island nation in East Asia, consisting of several main islands (Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku) and smaller islands, located in the Pacific Ocean.

3. **Compare Longitudes**:
   - Longitude measures east-west position, with higher values indicating locations farther east.
   - China's longitudinal range:
     - Westernmost point: Approximately 73°E (near the Pamir Mountains in Xinjiang).
     - Easternmost point: Approximately 135°E (at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri rivers in Heilongjiang Province, near Russia).
     - Key eastern cities: Beijing (~116°E), Shanghai (~121°E), and the eastern coast generally spans from about 120°E to 135°E.
   - Japan's longitudinal range:
     - Westernmost point: Yonaguni Island (~122.93°E), part of Okinawa Prefecture.
     - Easternmost point: Minami Torishima (~153.99°E), but for practical purposes, the main islands range from about 129°E (e.g., Fukuoka on Kyushu) to 146°E (e.g., Nemuro on Hokkaido).
     - Key cities: Tokyo (~139.76°E), Osaka (~135.50°E).

4. **Analyze Relative Positioning**:
   - Japan's westernmost point (Yonaguni Island at ~122.93°E) is east of China's easternmost major city, Shanghai (~121.47°E), by about 1.46 degrees longitude (roughly 160 km east, accounting for latitude).
   - Japan's main islands (e.g., Kyushu at ~130°E) are significantly east of China's eastern coast (e.g., Shanghai at ~121°E), with a difference of about 9 degrees longitude (over 1,000 km east).
   - China's easternmost point (~135°E) is in the far northeast (Heilongjiang), but Japan's main islands (e.g., Hokkaido at ~141°E) are still farther east.
   - The entire landmass of Japan lies east of the entirety of China when considering their standard geographical extents. For example:
     - From Beijing (116°E) to Tokyo (139°E), Tokyo is about 23 degrees east.
     - From Shanghai (121°E) to Nagasaki (129°E), Nagasaki is about 8 degrees east.

5. **Consider Directional Context**:
   - The East China Sea lies between China and Japan, with Japan positioned to the east of this sea.
   - On a map, Japan is consistently depicted east of China, across the Pacific Ocean.
   - There are no parts of China that are east of any part of Japan; the longitudinal overlap occurs only in the sense that Japan's western islands (e.g., Yonaguni) are slightly east of China's eastern coast, but still firmly in the eastern direction relative to the mainland.

6. **Address Potential Ambiguities**:
   - Taiwan: Often considered part of China politically, is located at approximately 120°E to 122°E. Japan (starting from ~122.93°E) is east of Taiwan.
   - Disputed territories (e.g., Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands): Controlled by Japan and located at ~123°E to 124°E, which is east of both Taiwan and mainland China.
   - No significant geographical exceptions challenge the general eastward positioning.

**Final Answer: Yes**
