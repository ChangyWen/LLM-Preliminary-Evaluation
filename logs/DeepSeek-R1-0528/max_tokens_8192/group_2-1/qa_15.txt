*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the speed of light faster than the speed of sound?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the speed of light is a fundamental constant in physics. In a vacuum, it's approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. That's about 3 × 10^8 m/s.

The speed of sound is not constant; it depends on the medium it's traveling through. For example, in air at room temperature (around 20°C), the speed of sound is about 343 meters per second. In other materials, like water or steel, it's faster, but it's generally much slower than light.

Even in the fastest mediums for sound, like solids, the speed of sound is still way less than the speed of light. For instance, in diamond, sound might travel at around 12,000 m/s, which is still only 1.2 × 10^4 m/s, compared to light's 3 × 10^8 m/s. That's a huge difference.

Light travels at about 874,000 times the speed of sound in air. Let me calculate that: 299,792,458 / 343 ≈ 874,030. So yes, roughly 874,000 times faster.

Even if we consider sound in water, where it's about 1,480 m/s, light is still about 202,563 times faster (299,792,458 / 1,480 ≈ 202,563).

And in a vacuum, light is at its fastest, while sound can't even travel in a vacuum because it needs a medium. So, in any scenario where both can exist, light is vastly faster.

The question doesn't specify the medium, but it's a general comparison. I think it's safe to say that universally, the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound.

I recall that in physics, this is a well-known fact. For example, you see lightning before you hear thunder because light travels much faster than sound.

So, my reasoning is:

1. Speed of light in vacuum: ≈ 3.00 × 10^8 m/s

2. Speed of sound in air: ≈ 343 m/s at 20°C

3. Comparison: 3.00 × 10^8 / 343 ≈ 8.74 × 10^5, meaning light is about 874,000 times faster.

4. In other media, sound is slower or comparable, but never faster than light. For example, the speed of sound in steel is about 5,960 m/s, which is still only 0.00596 × 10^8 m/s, so light is about 5,000 times faster even in steel.

5. Fundamentally, light is an electromagnetic wave and travels at the speed limit of the universe, while sound is a mechanical wave that depends on the medium's properties.

Therefore, yes, the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound.

Final answer should be Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the speeds involved**:
   - The speed of light in a vacuum is a universal constant, approximately **299,792,458 meters per second** (often rounded to **3.00 × 10⁸ m/s**).
   - The speed of sound is not constant; it varies depending on the medium (e.g., air, water, or solids). For example:
     - In dry air at 20°C (68°F), the speed of sound is approximately **343 meters per second**.
     - In water, it is about **1,480 m/s**, and in solids like steel, it can be up to **5,960 m/s**.

2. **Compare the speeds directly**:
   - Convert both speeds to the same units for easy comparison (e.g., meters per second):
     - Speed of light: **299,792,458 m/s**.
     - Speed of sound (in air): **343 m/s**.
   - Calculate the ratio:
     - Light speed / Sound speed (in air) = 299,792,458 / 343 ≈ **874,000**.
     - This means light is about **874,000 times faster** than sound in air.
   - Even in denser media where sound travels faster, light is still vastly faster:
     - In water: Light speed / Sound speed = 299,792,458 / 1,480 ≈ **202,563 times faster**.
     - In steel: Light speed / Sound speed = 299,792,458 / 5,960 ≈ **50,306 times faster**.

3. **Consider fundamental principles**:
   - Light (an electromagnetic wave) travels at the maximum possible speed in the universe and does not require a medium. In a vacuum, it reaches its peak speed.
   - Sound (a mechanical wave) requires a medium (e.g., air, liquid, or solid) to propagate and is always slower than light in any real-world scenario. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum, whereas light can.
   - This difference is observable in everyday phenomena, such as seeing lightning before hearing thunder during a storm, due to light arriving almost instantly while sound takes seconds to travel the same distance.

4. **Conclusion based on evidence**:
   - In all conditions where both light and sound can propagate, the speed of light is greater than the speed of sound by orders of magnitude. There are no known natural situations where sound travels faster than light.

**Final Answer: Yes**
