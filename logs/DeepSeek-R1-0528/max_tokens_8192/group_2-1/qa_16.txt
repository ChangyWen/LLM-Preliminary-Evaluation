First, the question is: "Is the boiling point of water higher than the freezing point of water?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the freezing point of water is the temperature at which water turns into ice, which is 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit. The boiling point is when water turns into steam, which is 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

Comparing these values: 100 degrees Celsius is greater than 0 degrees Celsius. Similarly, 212 degrees Fahrenheit is greater than 32 degrees Fahrenheit. So, in both common temperature scales, the boiling point is higher than the freezing point.

I should consider if there are any units or contexts where this might not be true. For example, in the Kelvin scale, freezing point is 273 K and boiling point is 373 K, and 373 is still greater than 273. So, no matter the scale, boiling point is higher.

The question is straightforward; it doesn't specify any particular scale, but since it's about the physical properties, the relative comparison should hold true.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall the definition: Freezing point is the temperature where liquid water solidifies, and boiling point is where liquid water vaporizes.

2. Standard values: At sea level, freezing point is 0°C, boiling point is 100°C.

3. Compare: 100 > 0, so boiling point is higher.

4. Confirm with other scales: Fahrenheit: 32°F freezing, 212°F boiling; 212 > 32. Kelvin: 273 K freezing, 373 K boiling; 373 > 273.

5. Consider any exceptions: Under different pressures, these points can change. For example, at higher altitudes, boiling point is lower, but freezing point is relatively stable. However, even then, the boiling point is still higher than the freezing point. For instance, on Mount Everest, boiling point is about 70°C, which is still higher than 0°C. Freezing point doesn't change significantly with pressure for water; it's mostly boiling point that does.

Freezing point can change slightly with pressure, but the effect is small. For example, under high pressure, freezing point decreases a bit, but it's still above 0°C in most cases? No, actually, for water, increasing pressure lowers the freezing point slightly. But even so, the boiling point is affected more.

But in all practical scenarios, boiling point is always higher than freezing point for water. I can't think of a situation where water boils at a temperature lower than it freezes. That would violate the laws of thermodynamics because liquid phase exists between solid and gas phases.

Yes, fundamentally, for any substance, the melting point (freezing point) is lower than the boiling point under standard conditions. The triple point might be different, but for water, triple point is around 0.01°C, which is still below boiling point.

So, no exceptions here.

Therefore, the answer should be yes.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether the boiling point of water is higher than its freezing point. This involves comparing two specific temperatures: the point where water freezes (turns to ice) and where it boils (turns to steam).

2. **Recall Standard Values**: Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or sea level):
   - The **freezing point** of water is **0°C** (32°F or 273 K).
   - The **boiling point** of water is **100°C** (212°F or 373 K).

3. **Compare the Values**: 
   - In Celsius: 100°C (boiling) vs. 0°C (freezing). Since 100 > 0, the boiling point is higher.
   - In Fahrenheit: 212°F (boiling) vs. 32°F (freezing). Since 212 > 32, the boiling point is higher.
   - In Kelvin: 373 K (boiling) vs. 273 K (freezing). Since 373 > 273, the boiling point is higher.

4. **Consider Potential Exceptions**:
   - **Pressure Effects**: Changes in pressure can alter the boiling point (e.g., at high altitudes, boiling point decreases), and to a lesser extent, the freezing point (e.g., under high pressure, freezing point may decrease slightly). However, even under non-standard conditions:
     - At extreme altitudes (e.g., Mount Everest), boiling point might be around 70°C, which is still higher than 0°C.
     - In all known scenarios, the boiling point of water remains above the freezing point because the liquid phase must exist between solid and gas phases. No conditions cause boiling point to fall below freezing point for water.
   - **Thermodynamic Principle**: For any substance, the boiling point is always higher than the freezing point under equilibrium conditions, as this reflects the energy required for phase changes (less energy to melt than to vaporize).

5. **Conclusion**: Based on standard definitions and real-world observations, the boiling point of water is consistently higher than its freezing point across all temperature scales and typical conditions.

**Final Answer: Yes**
