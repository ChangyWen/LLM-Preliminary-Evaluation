*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is a blue whale heavier than an elephant?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, and elephants are also very large, but I should recall specific weight ranges.

Let me start with the blue whale. Blue whales are marine mammals and can grow to enormous sizes. I think an adult blue whale can weigh up to 200 tons. But I should be precise. I recall that blue whales typically weigh between 100 and 150 tons, with some reaching up to 180 tons or more. But let's use average figures for comparison.

Actually, tons might not be the best unit; I should use kilograms or pounds for accuracy. But since the question is about heaviness, any unit is fine as long as I'm consistent.

Standard weight for a blue whale: I think the average weight is about 100 to 150 metric tons. Let me confirm: 1 metric ton is 1000 kilograms, so 100 tons is 100,000 kg.

Now, for elephants: there are two main species, African elephants and Asian elephants. African elephants are larger.

African bush elephants are the largest land animals. I think they weigh between 5,000 to 7,000 kilograms for males, and up to 6,000 kg or more.

Let me gather specific data:

- Blue whale: Average weight is approximately 100,000 to 150,000 kg (100 to 150 metric tons). The maximum recorded weight is about 173,000 kg, but for comparison, I'll use a typical figure.

- African elephant: Adult males weigh about 5,000 to 6,000 kg, with some up to 7,500 kg. Females are smaller, around 3,000 to 4,000 kg. But since we're comparing to the largest, I should consider the largest elephants.

The question doesn't specify, so I should use average or typical weights. But to be thorough, even the largest elephant is much smaller than a blue whale.

Let me get numbers:

Blue whale weight range:

- Minimum adult weight: around 50,000 kg (50 tons) for smaller individuals, but typically 70,000 to 150,000 kg.

- Average: about 110,000 kg (110 metric tons) for females, males are slightly lighter, but both are massive.

I found online that the average blue whale weighs about 100-120 metric tons, which is 100,000 to 120,000 kg.

Now for elephants:

African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana):

- Male: 4,500 to 6,000 kg, up to 7,500 kg in rare cases.

- Female: 2,500 to 3,500 kg.

Asian elephant (Elephas maximus):

- Male: 3,500 to 5,000 kg, up to 6,000 kg.

- Female: 2,500 to 3,000 kg.

So the heaviest elephants are African bush elephants, with maximum weights around 7,500 kg.

Now, comparing:

Blue whale: even the smallest adult blue whales are around 70,000 kg, which is 70 metric tons.

Elephant: maximum around 7,500 kg, which is 7.5 metric tons.

So, 70,000 kg vs 7,500 kg – that's a huge difference. 70,000 divided by 7,500 is about 9.33, so a blue whale is roughly 10 times heavier than the heaviest elephant.

To be precise:

Let's take average figures.

Average blue whale weight: let's say 110,000 kg (from sources).

Average African elephant male: about 5,500 kg.

110,000 / 5,500 = 20. So about 20 times heavier.

Even if I take the heaviest elephant at 10,000 kg (though rare), blue whale at 150,000 kg is 15 times heavier.

The largest blue whale ever recorded was about 190,000 kg, and the largest elephant recorded was about 10,400 kg, still less than 1/18th.

So, clearly, a blue whale is much heavier.

But is there any elephant species larger? No, African bush elephant is the largest land animal.

What about prehistoric animals? But the question is about current animals, I assume.

So, based on this, blue whale is heavier.

But let me make sure about the weights.

I recall that sometimes people say blue whales weigh as much as 30 elephants or something, which matches.

Another way: 1 ton = 1000 kg.

Blue whale: 100-150 tons

Elephant: African elephant 5-7 tons

So 100 tons vs 7 tons, blue whale is heavier.

Yes.

Therefore, the answer should be yes.

Final answer: Yes.

The question says "heavier than an elephant," and since all elephants are lighter, it's fine.

Also, for completeness, even a small blue whale calf might be lighter, but adults are compared.

The question implies typical adult sizes, I think.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the average weight of a blue whale: approximately 100,000 to 150,000 kilograms (100 to 150 metric tons).

2. Identify the average weight of the largest elephant species, the African bush elephant: adult males weigh about 4,500 to 6,000 kilograms, with a maximum of around 7,500 kg.

3. Compare the weights: The minimum blue whale weight (around 70,000 kg) is still greater than the maximum elephant weight (around 10,000 kg, though rare).

4. Therefore, a blue whale is significantly heavier than an elephant.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the key animals and their species**: 
   - The blue whale (*Balaenoptera musculus*) is the largest animal on Earth and a marine mammal.
   - Elephants are the largest land animals, with the African bush elephant (*Loxodonta africana*) being the largest species. For comparison, I will focus on the African bush elephant as it is heavier than the Asian elephant (*Elephas maximus*).

2. **Recall average weights for blue whales**:
   - Adult blue whales typically weigh between 100,000 and 150,000 kilograms (kg), or 100 to 150 metric tons.
   - Some sources cite an average weight of around 110,000 kg for females (which are larger than males), with maximum recorded weights reaching up to 173,000 kg. However, for a fair comparison, I will use the typical range of 100,000–150,000 kg.
   - Even the smallest adult blue whales (e.g., young adults) weigh at least 70,000 kg.

3. **Recall average weights for elephants**:
   - African bush elephants are the heaviest elephant species. Adult males weigh between 4,500 kg and 6,000 kg, with rare individuals reaching up to 7,500 kg.
   - Females are smaller, averaging 2,500–3,500 kg, but since the question is about elephants in general, I will consider the largest and most relevant comparison (adult males).
   - The absolute maximum recorded weight for an African bush elephant is about 10,400 kg, but this is exceptional.

4. **Compare the weights**:
   - Minimum blue whale weight (70,000 kg) vs. maximum elephant weight (10,400 kg): 70,000 kg > 10,400 kg.
   - Average blue whale weight (110,000 kg) vs. average elephant weight (5,500 kg for males): 110,000 kg > 5,500 kg.
   - This means a blue whale is at least 7 times heavier than the heaviest elephant ever recorded and about 20 times heavier on average.
   - Since all adult blue whales are heavier than all adult elephants (including the largest species), the comparison holds true.

5. **Consider any edge cases**:
   - Elephant calves or smaller species (like Asian elephants) are even lighter, so they do not affect the conclusion.
   - Blue whale calves can weigh around 2,700 kg at birth, but this is still less than an adult elephant. However, the question likely refers to adult animals, as weight comparisons typically do. Even so, adult blue whales are unequivocally heavier.

**Final Answer: Yes**
