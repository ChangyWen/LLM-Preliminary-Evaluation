*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Mount Everest taller than K2?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Mount Everest and K2 are both mountains, and they are among the tallest in the world. Mount Everest is widely recognized as the tallest mountain above sea level, but I should confirm the exact heights.

Let me recall the heights:

- Mount Everest is in the Himalayas, on the border between Nepal and China. Its height is approximately 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. I think this is the standard figure, but it might have been updated recently. I remember there was a new measurement in 2020, but I think it's still around 8,848 meters.

- K2 is also in the Himalayas, specifically in the Karakoram range, on the border between Pakistan and China. K2 is the second-highest mountain in the world. I think its height is about 8,611 meters (28,251 feet).

I should use the most accurate and recent data available. Since I'm an AI, I have access to general knowledge up to my last training data, which includes these facts.

Confirming the heights:

- Mount Everest: The commonly accepted height is 8,848 meters, but in December 2020, China and Nepal jointly announced a new height of 8,848.86 meters, but it's often rounded to 8,849 meters. For practical purposes, it's still about 8,848-8,849 meters.

- K2: I believe it's 8,611 meters. I think there was an expedition that measured it, but it hasn't changed significantly.

I can think about the rankings: Mount Everest is number one, and K2 is number two in terms of elevation above sea level.

So, based on that, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

But let me double-check the exact figures to be precise.

From memory:

- Mount Everest: 8,848 meters

- K2: 8,611 meters

That's a difference of about 237 meters, which is significant.

I can also think in feet:

- Mount Everest: 29,029 feet

- K2: 28,251 feet

Difference of about 778 feet.

So, yes, Everest is taller.

The question is straightforward, but I need to show step-by-step reasoning.

Step-by-step:

1. Identify the heights of both mountains.

2. Compare the heights.

3. Conclude which is taller.

Final answer: Yes, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

But to be thorough, I should mention the sources or the standard measurements.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I can state the heights.

Also, ensure there's no trick here. For example, sometimes people talk about tallest from base to peak, but in this context, it's standard elevation above sea level.

Mount Everest has the highest elevation above sea level.

K2 is sometimes considered more difficult to climb or has a higher death rate, but that doesn't affect the height.

Another thing: There's Mauna Kea in Hawaii, which is taller when measured from base to summit, but that's underwater, so above sea level, it's shorter. But here, we're comparing Everest and K2, both measured above sea level.

So, no issue.

Therefore, Mount Everest is taller.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says: "Is Mount Everest taller than K2?" so Yes.

And I need to box the final answer.

Reasoning process:

- Step 1: Recall that Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth when measured from sea level.

- Step 2: K2 is the second-highest mountain.

- Step 3: The height of Mount Everest is approximately 8,848 meters.

- Step 4: The height of K2 is approximately 8,611 meters.

- Step 5: Since 8,848 meters is greater than 8,611 meters, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

For accuracy, I can use the exact figures.

According to the latest data I have:

- Mount Everest: 8,848.86 meters (as per 2020 survey)

- K2: 8,610 meters (I think it's often cited as 8,611, but let's say approximately 8,610)

Actually, K2 is measured at 8,611 meters by most sources.

For example, from Wikipedia or standard references.

But since this is reasoning, I don't need to cite, just use common knowledge.

Step-by-step:

1. Mount Everest is located in the Himalayas and is recognized as the tallest mountain above sea level.

2. K2, also in the Karakoram range of the Himalayas, is recognized as the second-tallest mountain above sea level.

3. The elevation of Mount Everest is about 8,849 meters (using the rounded figure from the 2020 measurement).

4. The elevation of K2 is about 8,611 meters.

5. Comparing the two, 8,849 > 8,611, so Mount Everest is taller.

Therefore, the answer is Yes.

Final answer: Yes

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the key mountains and their rankings:**  
   - Mount Everest is widely recognized as the highest mountain on Earth when measured from sea level.  
   - K2 is recognized as the second-highest mountain on Earth when measured from sea level.  

2. **Recall the official heights:**  
   - The height of Mount Everest was most recently updated in 2020 through a joint survey by China and Nepal. The official elevation is **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)**, often rounded to **8,849 meters** for simplicity.  
   - The height of K2, based on the latest reliable surveys (e.g., by satellite and ground measurements), is **8,610 meters (28,251 feet)**, though it is sometimes cited as 8,611 meters. For consistency, we'll use the widely accepted figure of **8,610 meters**.  

3. **Compare the heights numerically:**  
   - Mount Everest: 8,849 meters  
   - K2: 8,610 meters  
   - Calculate the difference: 8,849 - 8,610 = 239 meters.  
   - Since 8,849 > 8,610, Mount Everest is taller than K2 by approximately 239 meters (or about 784 feet).  

4. **Consider potential nuances:**  
   - Heights are measured from sea level, which is the standard for comparing mountain elevations.  
   - Some mountains may appear taller based on other metrics (e.g., base-to-peak prominence), but for this question, sea-level elevation is the relevant measure.  
   - Mount Everest's height was reaffirmed in 2020, and K2's height has remained consistent, so no recent changes affect this comparison.  

5. **Conclusion based on the data:**  
   - The numerical comparison confirms that Mount Everest is taller than K2.  

**Final Answer: Yes**
