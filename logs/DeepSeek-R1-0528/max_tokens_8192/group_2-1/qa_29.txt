First, the question is: "Is the wavelength of red light longer than that of blue light?" I need to answer with a step-by-step reasoning process and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. Red light and blue light are both in the visible spectrum.

The visible spectrum ranges from about 380 nanometers (nm) to 750 nm. Blue light is on the shorter wavelength end, and red light is on the longer wavelength end.

Specifically:

- Blue light has wavelengths around 450 to 495 nm.

- Red light has wavelengths around 620 to 750 nm.

I should recall the order of colors in the visible spectrum. It's often remembered by the acronym ROYGBIV: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.

- Red has the longest wavelength.

- Violet has the shortest wavelength.

Blue is closer to violet, so it should have a shorter wavelength than red.

Confirming the wavelength ranges:

- Violet: ~380-450 nm

- Blue: ~450-495 nm

- Green: ~495-570 nm

- Yellow: ~570-590 nm

- Orange: ~590-620 nm

- Red: ~620-750 nm

Yes, so red light has wavelengths starting from about 620 nm up to 750 nm, while blue light is from about 450 nm to 495 nm. Therefore, the shortest red light (620 nm) is still longer than the longest blue light (495 nm). 620 nm is greater than 495 nm, so red light always has a longer wavelength than blue light in the visible spectrum.

Is that always true? Well, in the standard visible light context, yes. There might be variations, but generally, for typical red and blue light, red has longer wavelengths.

I can think about the relationship between wavelength and frequency. Wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) are related by the speed of light (c): c = λf. Since c is constant, if wavelength is longer, frequency is lower.

Red light has a lower frequency than blue light. For example, red light frequency is around 430-480 THz, and blue light is around 620-670 THz. Higher frequency means shorter wavelength, so blue has higher frequency, thus shorter wavelength.

Therefore, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Light is an electromagnetic wave, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths within the visible spectrum.

2. The visible spectrum is typically from about 380 nm (violet) to 750 nm (red).

3. Blue light is in the range of approximately 450-495 nm.

4. Red light is in the range of approximately 620-750 nm.

5. Comparing the ranges: the maximum wavelength for blue light is about 495 nm, and the minimum for red light is about 620 nm.

6. Since 495 nm < 620 nm, all blue light has shorter wavelengths than all red light.

7. Therefore, the wavelength of red light is longer than that of blue light.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "the wavelength of red light" and "that of blue light," which might imply a general comparison, not specific values. But in physics, it's well-established that red has longer wavelengths.

I think I'm confident with this.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Understand the electromagnetic spectrum**: Light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and visible light consists of different colors, each corresponding to a specific range of wavelengths. Wavelength is measured in nanometers (nm).

2. **Recall the order of visible light colors**: The visible spectrum is ordered from longest to shortest wavelength: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. This is often remembered using the acronym ROYGBIV.
   - Red light has the longest wavelengths in the visible spectrum.
   - Violet light has the shortest wavelengths, with blue light having shorter wavelengths than red.

3. **Identify specific wavelength ranges**:
   - Red light: approximately 620–750 nm.
   - Blue light: approximately 450–495 nm.

4. **Compare the wavelength ranges**:
   - The longest wavelength for blue light is about 495 nm.
   - The shortest wavelength for red light is about 620 nm.
   - Since 495 nm (blue) is less than 620 nm (red), blue light has shorter wavelengths than red light across their entire ranges.

5. **Consider the physics behind the relationship**: Wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) are inversely related by the speed of light (c), where \( c = \lambda f \). Since the speed of light is constant:
   - Blue light has a higher frequency (approximately 620–670 THz) because of its shorter wavelength.
   - Red light has a lower frequency (approximately 430–480 THz) because of its longer wavelength.
   This confirms that red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the established ranges and the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency, red light consistently has a longer wavelength than blue light.

### Final Answer:
Yes
