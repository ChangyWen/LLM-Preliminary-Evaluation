*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the atomic number of oxygen higher than that of carbon?"

I need to recall what atomic number means. Atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It defines the element and its position on the periodic table.

Now, I need to remember the atomic numbers for oxygen and carbon.

Starting with carbon: Carbon is element number 6. That means its atomic number is 6. So, carbon has 6 protons.

Next, oxygen: Oxygen is element number 8. So, its atomic number is 8, meaning it has 8 protons.

Comparing the two: Atomic number of carbon is 6, atomic number of oxygen is 8. Since 8 is greater than 6, oxygen has a higher atomic number than carbon.

I should double-check this to be sure. I know the periodic table order: Hydrogen (1), Helium (2), Lithium (3), Beryllium (4), Boron (5), Carbon (6), Nitrogen (7), Oxygen (8), and so on. Yes, that confirms it. Carbon is before oxygen, so oxygen has a higher atomic number.

The question asks for step-by-step reasoning and a final answer of Yes or No.

So, my reasoning:

1. Atomic number is the number of protons in an atom.

2. The atomic number of carbon is 6.

3. The atomic number of oxygen is 8.

4. Since 8 > 6, oxygen has a higher atomic number than carbon.

Therefore, the answer is Yes.

Final answer should be "Yes".

The question says: "Show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

So, I'll present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand atomic number**: The atomic number of an element is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It determines the element's identity and position in the periodic table.

2. **Recall the atomic number of carbon**: Carbon is an element with the symbol "C". From the periodic table, carbon has an atomic number of 6. This means a carbon atom has 6 protons.

3. **Recall the atomic number of oxygen**: Oxygen is an element with the symbol "O". From the periodic table, oxygen has an atomic number of 8. This means an oxygen atom has 8 protons.

4. **Compare the atomic numbers**:  
   - Carbon atomic number = 6  
   - Oxygen atomic number = 8  
   Since 8 is greater than 6, oxygen has a higher atomic number than carbon.

5. **Verify with periodic table order**: The periodic table is arranged in order of increasing atomic number. Elements are ordered as follows: hydrogen (1), helium (2), lithium (3), beryllium (4), boron (5), carbon (6), nitrogen (7), oxygen (8). This confirms that oxygen comes after carbon, so its atomic number is higher.

### Final Answer:
Yes
