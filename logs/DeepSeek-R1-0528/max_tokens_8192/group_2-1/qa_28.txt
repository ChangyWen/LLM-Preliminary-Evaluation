*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is a peregrine falcon faster than an eagle?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I recall that the peregrine falcon is known for being the fastest bird in the world, especially when it's diving or stooping. Eagles are also fast, but I'm not sure if they're as fast as peregrine falcons.

Let me think about the speeds. I remember that the peregrine falcon can reach speeds over 200 miles per hour (mph) during its high-speed dive. Specifically, I think it's around 240 mph or even higher in some cases. That's its stooping speed to catch prey.

Now, for eagles, there are different types. For example, the golden eagle or the bald eagle. Eagles are powerful flyers, but they don't typically dive as fast as falcons. I think eagles can reach speeds up to 100-150 mph in a dive, but it's less than the peregrine falcon.

Let me confirm this with some facts. From what I know:

- Peregrine falcon: Diving speed can be 200-240 mph (320-390 km/h).

- Bald eagle: Diving speed is around 75-100 mph (120-160 km/h).

- Golden eagle: I think they can dive faster, maybe up to 150-200 mph, but still, I believe the peregrine falcon is faster.

I should be precise. The peregrine falcon holds the record for the fastest animal in a dive. According to various sources, it's been clocked at over 200 mph, with some records at 242 mph or more.

For eagles, the golden eagle might be one of the faster eagles. I think golden eagles can reach speeds of about 150-200 mph in a steep dive, but it's generally less than the peregrine falcon.

In level flight, peregrine falcons are also fast, but not as fast as in a dive. Eagles might be comparable in level flight, but the question is about speed in general, I think. But when people say "faster," they often refer to the maximum speed, which for birds is usually during a dive.

The question doesn't specify, so I should consider the maximum speed.

Let me think about reliable sources. From biology classes or nature documentaries, peregrine falcons are consistently cited as the fastest birds.

Also, in terms of hunting, peregrine falcons use high-speed dives to strike prey, while eagles might use different techniques like soaring or grabbing with talons.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the birds: Peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and eagles (various species, but generally referring to large birds of prey like golden eagle or bald eagle).

2. Compare maximum speeds:
   - Peregrine falcon: Maximum recorded dive speed is approximately 242 mph (389 km/h), as per Guinness World Records or similar.
   - Eagle: For example, golden eagle's maximum dive speed is about 150-200 mph (240-320 km/h). Bald eagle is slower, around 100 mph.

3. Therefore, the peregrine falcon's top speed is higher than that of any eagle species.

4. Additionally, peregrine falcons are specialized for speed with their streamlined bodies and pointed wings, while eagles are built for strength and soaring.

5. So, based on this, the peregrine falcon is faster than an eagle.

But to be thorough, let's consider if there's any eagle that might be faster. I think the golden eagle is one of the fastest eagles, but still, it doesn't match the peregrine falcon. For instance, some sources say golden eagles can reach 200 mph, but peregrine falcons exceed that.

Moreover, peregrine falcons are often listed as the fastest bird, so eagles wouldn't be faster.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "an eagle," which could be ambiguous, but in common understanding, eagles are not faster than peregrine falcons.

So, step-by-step:

- Step 1: Peregrine falcon is renowned for its high-speed dive, reaching over 200 mph.

- Step 2: Eagles, such as golden or bald eagles, have maximum dive speeds less than 200 mph, typically 100-150 mph for bald eagles and up to 200 mph for golden eagles, but still below peregrine falcon records.

- Step 3: Therefore, the peregrine falcon is faster in terms of maximum speed.

- Final Answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question is whether a peregrine falcon is faster than an eagle. I need to compare their speeds, specifically focusing on maximum achievable speeds, as this is the standard way to determine which animal is "faster." Birds can have different speeds in level flight versus dives, but the peregrine falcon is most famous for its dive speed, which is often the key metric for such comparisons.

2. **Identify Key Species**:
   - **Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus)**: This bird is widely recognized as the fastest animal on Earth when in a hunting dive (also called a stoop). It is a medium-sized falcon found worldwide.
   - **Eagle**: Eagles are large birds of prey, and there are many species (e.g., golden eagle, bald eagle). For a fair comparison, I'll consider the fastest eagles, such as the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), as it is often cited for its speed. Bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) are slower and not typically known for high-speed dives.

3. **Gather Speed Data**:
   - **Peregrine Falcon Speed**: According to scientific records (e.g., from the Guinness World Records, National Geographic, and ornithological studies), the peregrine falcon can reach speeds of **over 200 mph (322 km/h)** in a controlled dive. The highest verified speed is approximately **242 mph (389 km/h)** during a stoop. This is due to its streamlined body, pointed wings, and specialized hunting technique.
   - **Eagle Speed**: 
     - Golden eagles are among the fastest eagles and can achieve high speeds in a dive. They are recorded reaching up to **150–200 mph (240–320 km/h)** in a steep descent, but this is less consistent and generally lower than the peregrine falcon's top speed.
     - Bald eagles, for comparison, have a maximum dive speed of around **75–100 mph (120–160 km/h)**, which is significantly slower.
     - In level flight, both peregrine falcons and eagles are slower (e.g., peregrine falcons cruise at 40–60 mph, while eagles can soar at 20–50 mph). However, since the peregrine falcon's dive speed is its defining trait and the context of "faster" often implies maximum speed, we focus on dive speeds for this comparison.

4. **Compare the Speeds**:
   - The peregrine falcon's maximum recorded speed (242 mph) exceeds the golden eagle's top speed (about 200 mph, with most sources capping it at 190–200 mph for golden eagles).
   - Even the fastest eagles do not match the peregrine falcon's dive capabilities. Peregrine falcons are evolutionarily adapted for speed, with a more aerodynamic build and hunting style that involves high-velocity strikes, while eagles rely more on strength, agility, and soaring for hunting.
   - Based on authoritative sources like the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), the peregrine falcon is consistently ranked as the fastest bird, with no eagle species surpassing it.

5. **Consider Context**: If the question refers to average speeds or level flight, eagles might be comparable or even faster in some scenarios (e.g., golden eagles can sustain high speeds in wind-assisted flight). However, given that the peregrine falcon's dive is its most notable speed feat and the question doesn't specify, the maximum speed is the most relevant metric. Thus, the peregrine falcon is faster overall.

6. **Conclusion**: Yes, the peregrine falcon is faster than any eagle species, primarily due to its unparalleled dive speed.

**Final Answer: Yes**
