*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the pH of lemon juice lower than that of water?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, where lower numbers mean more acidic, higher numbers mean more basic, and 7 is neutral.

Water is neutral, so its pH is 7. Pure water at 25°C has a pH of 7.

Lemon juice is acidic because it contains citric acid. I think lemon juice has a pH around 2 or 3. Let me confirm that.

From what I remember, lemon juice is quite acidic. I think it's between pH 2 and 3. For example, I've heard that it's about 2.4 or something like that. I should be precise.

Lemon juice has a lot of citric acid, which gives it a low pH. Water has no acids or bases, so it's neutral.

Therefore, since lemon juice is acidic, its pH should be less than 7, and water is 7, so lemon juice has a lower pH than water.

Lower pH means more acidic. So, if lemon juice has a pH of, say, 2, and water has 7, then 2 is less than 7, so yes, lemon juice has a lower pH.

I should make sure about the pH values. Let me think scientifically.

Standard pH values:

- Pure water: pH = 7 (neutral)

- Lemon juice: typically between 2.0 and 2.6, depending on the lemon and ripeness, but generally around 2.4.

Yes, that sounds right. For instance, vinegar has a pH of about 2.5 to 3, and lemon juice is similar or slightly lower.

Water from the tap might not be exactly 7 due to dissolved minerals, but pure water is 7, and we're comparing to lemon juice, which is definitely more acidic.

The question says "water," so I think we mean pure water or neutral water.

Similarly, lemon juice is the juice from lemons, which is acidic.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. pH measures acidity: lower pH = more acidic, higher pH = more basic.

2. Water is neutral with pH = 7.

3. Lemon juice contains citric acid, making it acidic.

4. Acidic substances have pH < 7.

5. Specifically, lemon juice has a pH around 2-3.

6. Therefore, pH of lemon juice (approximately 2-3) is less than pH of water (7).

7. So, the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

So, I need to present it clearly.

Also, I should be accurate. Is there any case where water might not be pH 7? Like, distilled water is pH 7, but some water might be slightly acidic or basic, but generally, for this context, water refers to neutral water.

Lemon juice is consistently acidic.

So, no doubt.

Let me phrase the reasoning.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand pH scale**: pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is, on a scale from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral (like pure water), values below 7 are acidic, and values above 7 are basic.

2. **pH of water**: Pure water at 25°C has a pH of exactly 7, as it is neutral and contains no significant acids or bases that would alter its pH. For the purpose of this comparison, we consider water to have a pH of 7.

3. **pH of lemon juice**: Lemon juice is acidic due to its high content of citric acid. Based on scientific measurements:
   - The typical pH range for lemon juice is between 2.0 and 2.6, with an average around 2.4.
   - This low pH confirms that lemon juice is strongly acidic.

4. **Comparison**:
   - Lemon juice pH ≈ 2.4 (acidic, less than 7).
   - Water pH = 7 (neutral).
   - Since 2.4 is less than 7, the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water.

5. **Conclusion**: Yes, the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water because lemon juice is acidic (pH < 7), while water is neutral (pH = 7).

**Final Answer**: Yes
