*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth less than that on the Moon?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that acceleration due to gravity depends on the mass and radius of the celestial body. The formula for gravitational acceleration at the surface is:

\[ g = \frac{G M}{R^2} \]

where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant,
- \( M \) is the mass of the body,
- \( R \) is the radius of the body.

So, for Earth and the Moon, I need to compare \( g_{\text{earth}} \) and \( g_{\text{moon}} \).

I recall that on Earth, \( g_{\text{earth}} \) is approximately 9.8 m/s². For the Moon, I think it's about 1.6 m/s². That means Earth's gravity is stronger, so \( g_{\text{earth}} \) should be greater than \( g_{\text{moon}} \), not less.

But the question is asking if Earth's gravity is less than the Moon's, which would be false. So, I should say No.

But let me confirm the values to be sure.

Mass of Earth, \( M_{\text{earth}} \): approximately \( 5.97 \times 10^{24} \) kg.

Radius of Earth, \( R_{\text{earth}} \): about 6,371 km, which is \( 6.371 \times 10^6 \) meters.

Mass of Moon, \( M_{\text{moon}} \): I think it's about \( 7.35 \times 10^{22} \) kg.

Radius of Moon, \( R_{\text{moon}} \): approximately 1,737 km, which is \( 1.737 \times 10^6 \) meters.

Gravitational constant, \( G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \) m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻². But I might not need the exact value since I'm comparing.

First, let's calculate \( g_{\text{earth}} \):

\[ g_{\text{earth}} = \frac{G \times M_{\text{earth}}}{R_{\text{earth}}^2} \]

Plug in the values:

\[ g_{\text{earth}} = \frac{(6.67430 \times 10^{-11}) \times (5.97 \times 10^{24})}{(6.371 \times 10^6)^2} \]

Calculate the denominator: \( (6.371 \times 10^6)^2 = 4.0589641 \times 10^{13} \)

Numerator: \( (6.67430 \times 10^{-11}) \times (5.97 \times 10^{24}) = 6.67430 \times 5.97 \times 10^{-11 + 24} = 6.67430 \times 5.97 \times 10^{13} \)

Compute 6.67430 × 5.97:

6.67430 × 6 = 40.0458, but better to calculate:

6.67430 × 5 = 33.3715

6.67430 × 0.97 = approximately 6.67430 × 1 - 6.67430 × 0.03 = 6.67430 - 0.200229 = 6.474071

So total 33.3715 + 6.474071 = 39.845571

Thus numerator ≈ 39.845571 × 10^{13} = 3.9845571 × 10^{14}

Now divide by denominator:

g_earth = (3.9845571 × 10^{14}) / (4.0589641 × 10^{13}) = (3.9845571 / 4.0589641) × 10^{14 - 13} = (3.9845571 / 4.0589641) × 10

Compute division: 3.9845571 / 4.0589641 ≈ 0.9817

Then × 10 = 9.817 m/s², which is about 9.8 m/s², as expected.

Now for the Moon:

g_moon = G * M_moon / R_moon^2

M_moon = 7.35 × 10^{22} kg

R_moon = 1.737 × 10^6 m

R_moon^2 = (1.737 × 10^6)^2 = 3.015169 × 10^{12}

Numerator: G * M_moon = (6.67430 × 10^{-11}) * (7.35 × 10^{22}) = 6.67430 × 7.35 × 10^{-11+22} = 6.67430 × 7.35 × 10^{11}

Compute 6.67430 × 7.35:

6.67430 × 7 = 46.7201

6.67430 × 0.35 = 2.335905

Total 46.7201 + 2.335905 = 49.056005

So numerator ≈ 49.056005 × 10^{11} = 4.9056005 × 10^{12}

Denominator R_moon^2 = 3.015169 × 10^{12}

g_moon = (4.9056005 × 10^{12}) / (3.015169 × 10^{12}) = 4.9056005 / 3.015169 ≈ 1.6268

So about 1.63 m/s², which is close to the standard value of 1.62 m/s² or so.

Therefore, g_earth ≈ 9.8 m/s² and g_moon ≈ 1.6 m/s², so g_earth > g_moon.

The question is: "Is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth less than that on the Moon?" Since 9.8 is greater than 1.6, it is not less; it is more.

So the answer should be No.

I can think in terms of ratios.

g_earth / g_moon = [ (G M_earth / R_earth^2) ] / [ (G M_moon / R_moon^2) ] = (M_earth / M_moon) * (R_moon^2 / R_earth^2)

M_earth / M_moon = 5.97e24 / 7.35e22 = 5.97e24 / 7.35e22 = (5.97 / 7.35) * 10^{2} = approximately 0.8122 * 100 = 81.22

R_moon / R_earth = 1737 / 6371 ≈ 0.2726

So (R_moon / R_earth)^2 ≈ (0.2726)^2 ≈ 0.0743

Then g_earth / g_moon = (M_earth / M_moon) * (R_moon / R_earth)^2 = 81.22 * 0.0743 ≈ ?

First, 80 * 0.0743 = 5.944, and 1.22 * 0.0743 ≈ 0.0906, total about 6.0346

So g_earth / g_moon ≈ 6.03, meaning g_earth is about 6 times g_moon, so g_earth is larger.

Therefore, acceleration due to gravity on Earth is not less than that on the Moon; it is greater.

So the answer to the question is No.

The question specifically asks if it is less, and since it is not, it's false.

Final answer should be No.

I think I should state it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

To determine if the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is less than that on the Moon, we use the formula for gravitational acceleration at the surface of a celestial body:

\[ g = \frac{G \cdot M}{R^2} \]

where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant (\( 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \)),
- \( M \) is the mass of the body,
- \( R \) is the radius of the body.

We need to compare \( g_{\text{earth}} \) and \( g_{\text{moon}} \).

**Step 1: Gather known values for Earth and the Moon.**

- **Earth:**
  - Mass, \( M_{\text{earth}} = 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \)
  - Radius, \( R_{\text{earth}} = 6.371 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \)

- **Moon:**
  - Mass, \( M_{\text{moon}} = 7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg} \)
  - Radius, \( R_{\text{moon}} = 1.737 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \)

**Step 2: Calculate \( g_{\text{earth}} \).**

\[
g_{\text{earth}} = \frac{G \cdot M_{\text{earth}}}{R_{\text{earth}}^2}
\]

First, compute the denominator:
\[
R_{\text{earth}}^2 = (6.371 \times 10^6)^2 = 4.0589641 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^2
\]

Next, compute the numerator:
\[
G \cdot M_{\text{earth}} = (6.67430 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (5.97 \times 10^{24}) = 3.9845571 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^3 \text{s}^{-2}
\]

Now, divide:
\[
g_{\text{earth}} = \frac{3.9845571 \times 10^{14}}{4.0589641 \times 10^{13}} \approx 9.817 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

(Approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), which is the standard value.)

**Step 3: Calculate \( g_{\text{moon}} \).**

\[
g_{\text{moon}} = \frac{G \cdot M_{\text{moon}}}{R_{\text{moon}}^2}
\]

First, compute the denominator:
\[
R_{\text{moon}}^2 = (1.737 \times 10^6)^2 = 3.015169 \times 10^{12} \, \text{m}^2
\]

Next, compute the numerator:
\[
G \cdot M_{\text{moon}} = (6.67430 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (7.35 \times 10^{22}) = 4.9056005 \times 10^{12} \, \text{m}^3 \text{s}^{-2}
\]

Now, divide:
\[
g_{\text{moon}} = \frac{4.9056005 \times 10^{12}}{3.015169 \times 10^{12}} \approx 1.6268 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

(Approximately \( 1.6 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), which is the standard value.)

**Step 4: Compare \( g_{\text{earth}} \) and \( g_{\text{moon}} \).**

- \( g_{\text{earth}} \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)
- \( g_{\text{moon}} \approx 1.6 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)

Since \( 9.8 > 1.6 \), \( g_{\text{earth}} > g_{\text{moon}} \). Therefore, the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is greater than that on the Moon, not less.

**Step 5: Answer the question directly.**

The question asks: "Is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth less than that on the Moon?" Based on the calculations, it is not less.

**Final Answer: No**
