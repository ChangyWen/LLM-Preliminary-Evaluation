*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine the years when Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein died. Then, I can compare those years to see who died later.

Isaac Newton: He was a famous physicist and mathematician. I think he lived in the 17th and 18th centuries. I recall that Newton was born in 1643 and died in 1727. Let me confirm that. Yes, Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643, and died on March 31, 1727.

Albert Einstein: He was a physicist known for the theory of relativity. He lived in the 20th century. Einstein was born in 1879 and died in 1955. Specifically, born on March 14, 1879, and died on April 18, 1955.

Now, I have:

- Newton died in 1727

- Einstein died in 1955

To find out who died later, I need to see which year is more recent. 1955 is much later than 1727. 1955 minus 1727 is 228 years later. So, Einstein died much later than Newton.

The question is: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?" That means: Did Newton die after Einstein? In other words, is Newton's death year after Einstein's death year?

From above:

- Newton died in 1727

- Einstein died in 1955

So, 1727 is before 1955, meaning Newton died before Einstein. Therefore, Newton did not die later than Einstein; Einstein died later than Newton.

The phrase "die later than" means that the death occurred at a later point in time. So, if A dies later than B, it means A's death year is greater than B's death year.

In this case:

- Newton death year: 1727

- Einstein death year: 1955

Since 1727 < 1955, Newton died before Einstein, so he did not die later than Einstein. Einstein died later than Newton.

Therefore, the answer to "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?" is No.

I should make sure about the dates. Let me double-check the death years.

Isaac Newton: Confirmed, died 1727. He was born in 1642 or 1643, but died in 1727. Yes.

Albert Einstein: Died 1955. Yes, he died in Princeton, New Jersey, on April 18, 1955.

No issues with the dates.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify Isaac Newton's death year: 1727.

2. Identify Albert Einstein's death year: 1955.

3. Compare the years: 1727 vs. 1955.

4. Since 1727 is less than 1955, Newton died before Einstein.

5. Therefore, Newton did not die later than Einstein.

Final answer: No.

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

So, I need to present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Identify Isaac Newton's death year:**
   - Isaac Newton was a renowned physicist and mathematician.
   - Historical records show that Newton died on March 31, 1727.
   - Therefore, Newton's death year is **1727**.

2. **Identify Albert Einstein's death year:**
   - Albert Einstein was a famous physicist known for the theory of relativity.
   - Historical records show that Einstein died on April 18, 1955.
   - Therefore, Einstein's death year is **1955**.

3. **Compare the death years:**
   - Newton died in 1727, and Einstein died in 1955.
   - Numerically, 1727 is less than 1955 (1727 < 1955), meaning 1727 comes before 1955 in the timeline.
   - Therefore, Newton died before Einstein, not later.

4. **Interpret the question:**
   - The question asks: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?"
   - "Die later than" means that Newton's death occurred after Einstein's death in time.
   - Since Newton died in 1727 and Einstein died in 1955, Newton did not die later than Einstein; Einstein died later than Newton.

5. **Conclusion based on comparison:**
   - Because 1727 is earlier than 1955, the answer to the question is **No**.

**Final Answer: No**
