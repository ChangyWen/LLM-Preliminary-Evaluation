*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. It ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and greater than 7 is basic.

Water is typically neutral, so its pH is around 7. Pure water has a pH of 7 at 25°C because it has an equal concentration of H+ and OH- ions.

Lemon juice is acidic because it contains citric acid. I know that lemon juice has a low pH, meaning it's acidic. I think lemon juice has a pH around 2 or 3. Let me confirm that.

From general knowledge, citrus fruits like lemons are acidic. Lemon juice is often cited as having a pH between 2 and 3. For example, it might be about 2.4 or so. I should be precise.

The pH scale is logarithmic, so a pH of 2 is more acidic than pH 3, and both are much more acidic than pH 7.

Water has a pH of 7, which is neutral.

Lemon juice has a pH less than 7, say around 2 to 3.

Therefore, lemon juice has a lower pH than water because lower pH means more acidic.

The question is: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?"

If lemon juice has a lower pH than water, then water does not have a lower pH; it has a higher pH.

Let me denote:

- pH of water = 7 (approximately)

- pH of lemon juice ≈ 2.5 (for example)

Since 7 > 2.5, the pH of water is higher than the pH of lemon juice.

Therefore, the pH of water is not lower; it is higher.

So, is the pH of water lower than lemon juice? No, it is higher.

The question is: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?"

We need to compare: pH_water vs pH_lemon_juice.

pH_water = 7

pH_lemon_juice ≈ 2.5

Since 7 is greater than 2.5, pH_water is greater than pH_lemon_juice, so pH_water is not lower; it is higher.

Therefore, the answer should be No.

But let me make sure about the pH values.

Is tap water exactly 7? Sometimes it can be slightly different due to dissolved minerals, but generally, we consider pure water as pH 7.

Lemon juice: I recall that the pH of lemon juice is typically between 2.0 and 2.6. Let me confirm with a reliable source in my mind.

For example, in chemistry, lemon juice is often used as an example of a weak acid with pH around 2.5.

Yes.

Vinegar has pH around 2.4 to 3.4, and lemon juice is similar.

So, lemon juice pH < 7, water pH = 7.

Therefore, lemon juice has lower pH than water.

Hence, water does not have lower pH than lemon juice.

The question is phrased as "lower than", so if A is lower than B, it means A < B.

Here, pH_water < pH_lemon_juice? Is that true?

No: pH_water = 7, pH_lemon_juice = 2.5, so 7 < 2.5? False, because 7 is greater than 2.5.

7 > 2.5, so pH_water > pH_lemon_juice, meaning pH_water is not less than; it is greater.

Therefore, the statement "pH of water is lower than that of lemon juice" is false.

So, answer is No.

But let me think if there's any trick.

Is distilled water exactly 7? Yes.

Lemon juice might vary, but it's always acidic, pH less than 4, I think.

Even if it's 3 or 4, it's still less than 7.

Water is 7, so no.

Unless it's alkaline water or something, but the question says "water", which I assume is pure water.

Similarly, lemon juice is the juice from lemons.

So, I think it's straightforward.

Final answer should be No.

The question asks for step-by-step reasoning and final answer.

So, in reasoning:

Step 1: pH is a scale from 0 to 14, with lower values being more acidic.

Step 2: Pure water has a neutral pH of 7.

Step 3: Lemon juice is acidic due to citric acid, and its pH is typically around 2 to 3.

Step 4: Since 2 to 3 is less than 7, lemon juice has a lower pH than water.

Step 5: Therefore, the pH of water is not lower than that of lemon juice; it is higher.

Step 6: So, the answer to the question "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?" is No.

Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand pH**: pH is a scale that measures how acidic or basic a substance is, ranging from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral, values below 7 are acidic, and values above 7 are basic. Lower pH values indicate higher acidity.

2. **pH of Water**: Pure water (such as distilled water) has a neutral pH of 7.0 at 25°C. This is because water dissociates slightly into equal concentrations of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions, resulting in a balanced pH.

3. **pH of Lemon Juice**: Lemon juice is acidic due to the presence of citric acid and other organic acids. Its pH typically ranges from 2.0 to 2.6, depending on factors like ripeness and concentration. For this comparison, we can use an average pH of approximately 2.3.

4. **Compare the pH Values**:
   - pH of water = 7.0
   - pH of lemon juice ≈ 2.3
   - Since 7.0 is greater than 2.3, the pH of water is higher than the pH of lemon juice.

5. **Answer the Question**: The question asks if the pH of water is lower than that of lemon juice. Based on the comparison:
   - Water pH (7.0) is not lower than lemon juice pH (2.3); it is higher.
   - Therefore, the statement is false.

### Final Answer:
No
