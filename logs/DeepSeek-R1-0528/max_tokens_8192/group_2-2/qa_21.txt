*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is China located east of Japan?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I should recall the geographical locations of China and Japan. Both are countries in East Asia. China is a large country, and Japan is an island nation to the east of the Asian mainland.

Now, let's think about their relative positions. Japan consists of several islands, including Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku. It's situated in the Pacific Ocean, east of the Korean Peninsula and China.

China is on the mainland of Asia. Its eastern coast faces the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea. Japan is to the east of that, across the sea.

Specifically, if I look at a map, China's easternmost point is around Shanghai or the Shandong Peninsula, and Japan's westernmost point is, for example, Kyushu or the islands near Korea.

The longitude coordinates might help. I remember that Japan is generally between approximately 125°E to 145°E longitude, and China is between about 73°E to 135°E longitude. China's easternmost longitude is around 135°E, which is in Heilongjiang province, but the coast is around 120°E to 125°E.

Let me be more precise. Beijing is at about 116°E, Shanghai is around 121°E. Tokyo, Japan, is at about 139°E. So Tokyo is east of Shanghai because 139°E is greater than 121°E.

Longitude increases as you go east from the Prime Meridian (0°). So higher longitude means further east.

Therefore, since Tokyo is at 139°E and Shanghai is at 121°E, Tokyo is east of Shanghai. But the question is about China and Japan as countries, not specific cities.

Generally, Japan as a whole is east of China. For example, the closest points: China's eastern coast is around 120°E to 125°E, and Japan's western islands are around 130°E to 135°E. So Japan is east of China.

But let's confirm with the easternmost point of China. I think it's at Fuyuan, Heilongjiang, which is about 134°E. Japan's westernmost point is Yonaguni Island, which is around 123°E. Yonaguni is part of Japan and is at approximately 122°56'E, which is about 123°E.

China's easternmost point: I believe it's at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri rivers, around 135°E, but that's in the north. For the main part, the coast is south of that.

To be thorough:

- China's easternmost point: Fuyuan County, Heilongjiang, at about 134°40'E.

- Japan's westernmost point: Yonaguni Island, Okinawa Prefecture, at about 122°56'E.

Now, comparing longitudes: 134°40'E for China and 122°56'E for Japan. 134°40'E is greater than 122°56'E, meaning Fuyuan is east of Yonaguni.

But that can't be right because Japan is supposed to be east of China. I think I have a mistake here.

Yonaguni Island is part of Japan, and it's at 122°56'E, which is west of China's easternmost point at 134°40'E.

Longitude: 122°56'E is approximately 122.93°E, and 134°40'E is approximately 134.67°E. So 134.67°E is larger, meaning it's further east.

Therefore, China's easternmost point at 134.67°E is east of Japan's westernmost point at 122.93°E.

But that suggests that part of China is east of part of Japan. However, Japan has points further east, like Tokyo at 139°E.

The question is about the countries' positions. Typically, when we say "China is located east of Japan," it means that China as a whole is to the east of Japan, which isn't true.

Let's think about the core areas. Most of China is west of Japan. For example, Beijing is at 116°E, Tokyo at 139°E, so Tokyo is east of Beijing. Shanghai at 121°E is west of Tokyo.

But Japan has islands that are west of China's eastern coast? No.

Yonaguni Island is at 122.93°E, and Shanghai is at 121.47°E. So Shanghai is at 121.47°E, Yonaguni at 122.93°E, so Yonaguni is east of Shanghai because 122.93 > 121.47.

Similarly, China's eastern coast is around 120-125°E, Japan's western islands around 122-130°E, so generally, Japan is east of China.

But earlier, with the easternmost point of China being at 134.67°E, which is east of some parts of Japan.

Let's clarify: Japan's territory includes the Ryukyu Islands, with Yonaguni at 122.93°E, and also the Ogasawara Islands which are further east, but the main islands are from about 130°E to 145°E.

China's territory includes all of its land, so Fuyuan at 134.67°E is part of China, and it is east of Yonaguni Island (122.93°E) since 134.67 > 122.93.

In fact, Fuyuan is even east of Okinawa (around 128°E) and east of Kyushu (around 130-132°E). Fuyuan at 134.67°E is east of Fukuoka at about 130°E, for example.

So, geographically, there is an overlap or China extends further east than some western parts of Japan.

Therefore, it is not accurate to say that China is located east of Japan. Instead, most of Japan is east of China, but parts of China are east of parts of Japan.

For the purpose of this question, I think we need a general answer.

Perhaps the question means relative to the main territories.

I recall that Japan is often described as being to the east of China. For example, in a regional context, Japan is east of the East China Sea, while China is to the west.

In terms of standard geographical references, China is west of Japan.

Let me think about the prime meridian. Places with higher longitude are east.

The average longitude of China is about 104°E, and for Japan, it's about 138°E, so Japan is east of China.

The easternmost point of China is at 135°E or so, but Japan extends to 153°E with Minami-Tori-shima, but that's remote. For practical purposes, the main islands are 130-140°E.

China's main eastern point is around 120-125°E.

So, to answer "is China located east of Japan," it should be no, because China is west of Japan.

But let's confirm with the coordinates.

Take two points:

- Eastern China: Shanghai, 121.47°E

- Western Japan: Fukuoka, 130.45°E

130.45 > 121.47, so Fukuoka is east of Shanghai.

Eastern Japan: Tokyo, 139.69°E, even further east.

Now, China's easternmost: Fuyuan, 134.67°E

Japan's westernmost: Yonaguni, 122.93°E

Since 122.93°E < 134.67°E, Yonaguni is west of Fuyuan.

Therefore, Yonaguni (Japan) is west of Fuyuan (China), meaning that part of Japan is west of part of China.

However, in terms of the bulk of the territory, China is to the west, and Japan to the east.

But the question is "located east of," which might be interpreted as the entire country being east.

I think for such questions, we consider the relative position based on the center or the main part.

Perhaps I should think about the direction.

If I am in Japan, China is to the west. If I am in China, Japan is to the east.

So, China is west of Japan, not east.

Therefore, China is not located east of Japan; it is located west of Japan.

The question says "east of Japan," so if Japan is the reference, China is west.

For example, "east of Japan" would be places like the Pacific Ocean, Hawaii, etc., not China.

China is west of Japan.

So, the answer should be no.

But let's make sure about the easternmost point.

China has a point at 134.67°E, and Japan has points as west as 122.93°E, so there are areas where China is east of Japan, but that's not the standard way to answer.

In geography, when we say one country is east of another, we mean that the first country is entirely or mostly east of the second, which is not the case here.

For instance, we say Canada is north of the USA, even though parts of Canada are south of parts of the USA (like Point Pelee in Canada is south of parts of California), but generally, Canada is north.

Similarly, here, generally, China is west of Japan.

Moreover, in the context of East Asia, Japan is east of China.

So, for this question, China is not located east of Japan; it is located west of Japan.

Therefore, the answer is no.

Final answer should be No.

But let's see the reasoning step by step.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether China is located east of Japan. This requires comparing the geographical positions of both countries.

2. **Recall Basic Geography**: 
   - China is a large country primarily located on the Asian mainland.
   - Japan is an island nation situated in the Pacific Ocean, separated from the Asian mainland by the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea.

3. **Consider Relative Positions**:
   - China's eastern coast faces the East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and part of the Pacific Ocean.
   - Japan lies to the east of this coast, across the East China Sea. For example:
     - Major Chinese cities like Shanghai (approximately 121°E longitude) and Beijing (approximately 116°E longitude) are on or near the eastern coast.
     - Major Japanese cities like Tokyo (approximately 139°E longitude) and Osaka (approximately 135°E longitude) are on the main islands, which are further east.

4. **Analyze Longitude Coordinates**:
   - Longitude measures east-west position, with higher values indicating locations further east.
   - China's easternmost point is at Fuyuan, Heilongjiang (approximately 134.67°E), but most of its population and territory lie west of 120°E to 125°E.
   - Japan's westernmost point is Yonaguni Island, Okinawa Prefecture (approximately 122.93°E), and its main islands (e.g., Honshu, Kyushu) range from about 129°E to 146°E.
   - Comparing key points:
     - Shanghai, China (121.47°E) vs. Fukuoka, Japan (130.45°E): Fukuoka is east of Shanghai.
     - Fuyuan, China (134.67°E) vs. Yonaguni, Japan (122.93°E): Fuyuan is east of Yonaguni, but this is an exception due to Japan's remote western islands. The core territories show Japan is generally east of China.

5. **General Geographic Consensus**:
   - Geographically, Japan is considered to be east of China, not the other way around. This is standard in maps, atlases, and regional descriptions (e.g., Japan is often referred to as "east of China" in East Asia).
   - If China were east of Japan, it would imply that China is in the Pacific Ocean beyond Japan, which is not the case. Instead, China is west of Japan, with the Korean Peninsula and seas in between.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the overall positions, China is not located east of Japan; it is located west of Japan. Therefore, the answer is no.

**Final Answer: No**
