*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world. K2 is also one of the tallest mountains, but I think Everest is taller. Let me recall the heights.

Mount Everest's height is approximately 8,848 meters above sea level. I think that's the standard figure.

K2, also known as Mount Godwin-Austen, is the second-highest mountain. I believe its height is around 8,611 meters.

Let me double-check that. I should be precise.

From memory:

- Mount Everest: 8,848 meters (29,029 feet)

- K2: 8,611 meters (28,251 feet)

Yes, that sounds right. So, Everest is taller.

But I should make sure about the exact measurements. Heights can vary slightly based on sources, but generally, Everest is accepted as taller.

I recall that there was some controversy about Everest's height, like with rock height versus snow height, but I think the consensus is that Everest is taller than K2.

In 2020, China and Nepal announced a new height for Everest as 8,848.86 meters, but that's still higher than K2.

K2's height is often listed as 8,611 meters.

So, 8,848 vs 8,611 â€“ that's a difference of about 237 meters, so Everest is clearly taller.

The question is straightforward: "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?" Based on the heights, no, K2 is not taller; Everest is taller.

But let me confirm the heights to be thorough.

I can think about the rankings: Mount Everest is number one, K2 is number two in terms of height above sea level.

K2 is sometimes called the "Savage Mountain" because it's more difficult to climb, but that doesn't affect its height.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the heights:

   - Mount Everest: Approximately 8,848 meters

   - K2: Approximately 8,611 meters

2. Compare the heights:

   - 8,848 meters > 8,611 meters

3. Therefore, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

4. So, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.

Final answer: No.

The question is: "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?" So, the answer is No.

I should present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the heights of both mountains**:
   - **Mount Everest**: The widely accepted height, as confirmed by multiple surveys (including the 2020 joint survey by China and Nepal), is **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)** above sea level. This makes it the highest mountain on Earth.
   - **K2**: The second-highest mountain, with a height of **8,611 meters (28,251 feet)** above sea level, based on standard measurements.

2. **Compare the heights**:
   - Mount Everest: 8,848.86 meters
   - K2: 8,611 meters
   - Since 8,848.86 > 8,611, Mount Everest is taller than K2 by approximately 237 meters.

3. **Consider any potential controversies**:
   - There have been minor debates about measurement methods (e.g., rock height vs. snow cap height), but these do not change the fact that Mount Everest is consistently recognized as taller. For example, even if using older or alternative figures (e.g., Everest at 8,848 meters and K2 at 8,611 meters), Everest remains higher.
   - K2 is known for being more challenging to climb (earning it the nickname "Savage Mountain"), but this does not affect its height relative to Everest.

4. **Conclusion based on data**:
   - K2 is not taller than Mount Everest; it is the second-highest mountain.

**Final Answer: No**
