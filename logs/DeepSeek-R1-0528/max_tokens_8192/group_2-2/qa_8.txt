*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the Gobi Desert hotter than the Sahara Desert?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that both are deserts, but they have different characteristics. The Sahara is in North Africa, and it's known for being extremely hot. The Gobi Desert is in Asia, covering parts of northern China and southern Mongolia. It's a cold desert, meaning it can get very cold in winter.

Key point: The Sahara is often considered the hottest desert in the world. I should recall some temperature data to compare.

Average temperatures:

- Sahara Desert: Average high temperatures can be around 38°C (100°F) in summer, but it can get much hotter, like over 50°C (122°F) in some places. The annual average temperature is high.

- Gobi Desert: Because it's a cold desert, summers can be hot, but winters are very cold. Average summer temperatures might be around 25-30°C (77-86°F), but winter temperatures can drop to -40°C (-40°F) or lower. The annual average is lower.

The question is about which one is hotter. I need to clarify if it's asking about peak temperatures, average temperatures, or overall heat.

Typically, when people say "hotter," they might mean higher maximum temperatures or higher average temperatures. But since the Gobi has extreme cold, its average temperature is probably lower.

Let me think about specific data.

From what I remember:

- Sahara: One of the hottest places on Earth. For example, in places like Death Valley (which is similar, but Sahara has recorded high temperatures). The highest temperature recorded in the Sahara is over 50°C, and average summer highs are around 40°C.

- Gobi: The Gobi has a continental climate. In summer, it can get hot, like 30-35°C, but not as high as the Sahara. And in winter, it's freezing.

So, for maximum temperatures, the Sahara is hotter.

But let's confirm with reliable sources. Since I'm an AI, I can access general knowledge.

I recall that the Sahara Desert has higher average annual temperatures compared to the Gobi.

For instance:

- Sahara average annual temperature: around 30°C in some parts.

- Gobi average annual temperature: around 3°C to 10°C, depending on the region. That's much lower.

The Gobi is classified as a cold desert because of its temperature range and low precipitation.

Whereas the Sahara is a hot desert.

Therefore, overall, the Sahara is hotter.

But the question is: "Is the Gobi Desert hotter than the Sahara Desert?" So, based on this, no, the Gobi is not hotter; the Sahara is hotter.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the deserts: Gobi Desert in Asia, Sahara Desert in Africa.

2. Climate types: Gobi is a cold desert with large temperature variations; Sahara is a hot desert with consistently high temperatures.

3. Temperature comparison:

   - Maximum temperatures: Sahara can exceed 50°C; Gobi reaches about 40°C in summer but much colder in winter.

   - Minimum temperatures: Sahara can be cool at night but rarely freezing; Gobi can be below -40°C in winter.

   - Average temperatures: Sahara has a higher annual average temperature. For example, in the central Sahara, average annual temperature is around 25-30°C, while in the Gobi, it's around 2-8°C (sources vary, but significantly lower).

4. Supporting facts:

   - According to climate data, the hottest desert is the Sahara, with places like Al Aziziyah, Libya (though records are disputed, but generally Sahara is hottest).

   - The Gobi is not known for extreme heat; it's known for cold winters and being arid.

Therefore, the Gobi Desert is not hotter than the Sahara Desert.

Final answer should be No.

The question says "hotter," which might be ambiguous. But in common usage, it refers to higher temperatures, and based on averages or extremes, Sahara wins.

To be precise, if we compare summer highs, the Sahara still has higher temperatures. For example, average July high in Gobi might be 32°C, while in Sahara it's 40°C or more.

Specific locations:

- In the Gobi, Ulaanbaatar (though not in desert, nearby) has cold winters; desert areas like Dalanzadgad in Mongolia: summer highs average 30°C, winter lows -25°C.

- In Sahara, Timbuktu or similar: summer highs 42°C, winter highs still around 30°C.

So, in all aspects, Sahara is hotter.

Thus, Gobi is not hotter.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks if the Gobi Desert is hotter than the Sahara Desert. "Hotter" typically refers to higher average temperatures, peak temperatures, or overall heat intensity. I'll consider both average annual temperatures and extreme maximum temperatures for a comprehensive comparison.

2. **Climate Classification**:
   - The **Sahara Desert** (located in North Africa) is classified as a "hot desert." It experiences consistently high temperatures year-round due to its low latitude, clear skies, and minimal cloud cover.
   - The **Gobi Desert** (located in northern China and southern Mongolia) is classified as a "cold desert." It has a continental climate with extreme seasonal temperature variations—hot summers but very cold winters—due to its higher latitude and inland position.

3. **Average Annual Temperature Comparison**:
   - Sahara Desert: The average annual temperature ranges from **25°C to 30°C (77°F to 86°F)** in many areas, with some regions exceeding this. For example, in places like Timbuktu (Mali), the average annual temperature is around 28°C (82°F).
   - Gobi Desert: The average annual temperature is much lower, typically between **3°C and 10°C (37°F to 50°F)**. For instance, in Dalanzadgad (Mongolia), a key Gobi city, the average annual temperature is about 3.5°C (38°F).
   - **Conclusion**: The Sahara has a significantly higher average annual temperature than the Gobi, making it hotter overall.

4. **Peak Summer Temperature Comparison**:
   - Sahara Desert: Summer temperatures frequently exceed **40°C (104°F)**, with record highs reaching **50–58°C (122–136°F)** in locations like Al Aziziyah, Libya (though some records are disputed, it consistently ranks among the hottest places on Earth).
   - Gobi Desert: Summer temperatures are warm but not as extreme, with highs averaging **30–35°C (86–95°F)**. The highest recorded temperature in the Gobi is around **40–45°C (104–113°F)**, which is lower than the Sahara's peaks.
   - **Conclusion**: Even during the hottest months, the Sahara experiences higher peak temperatures than the Gobi.

5. **Seasonal Variations**:
   - Sahara: Winters are mild, with average lows rarely dropping below 10°C (50°F) in most areas. Nighttime temperatures can be cooler but seldom reach freezing.
   - Gobi: Winters are extremely cold, with temperatures often plummeting to **-20°C to -40°C (-4°F to -40°F)**. This contributes to a lower annual average and means the Gobi is not "hot" for a significant part of the year.
   - **Conclusion**: The Gobi's harsh winters reduce its overall heat profile, while the Sahara maintains consistently high temperatures.

6. **Overall Heat Assessment**:
   - Based on all factors (average annual temperature, peak summer heat, and consistency), the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert. The Gobi's classification as a cold desert, with its severe winter cold, means it cannot match the Sahara's sustained high temperatures.

**Final Answer: No**
