*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is an elephant heavier than a blue whale?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that elephants are large land animals, and blue whales are the largest animals on Earth. But I should confirm the average weights.

Let me recall some facts:

- African elephants are the largest land animals. Adult males can weigh between 4,500 to 6,800 kilograms (about 5 to 7.5 tons).

- Blue whales are marine mammals and are much larger. An adult blue whale can weigh up to 150,000 kilograms (about 165 tons) or more.

I think I should be more precise. Let me think about average weights.

For elephants:

- African bush elephant: males average around 6,000 kg (6.6 tons), females smaller.

- But there might be variations; some sources say up to 12,000 kg, but that's rare. Typically, it's 4,000 to 7,000 kg.

For blue whales:

- Blue whales are the heaviest animals known. The average weight is about 100,000 to 150,000 kg for adults. The maximum recorded is around 173,000 kg.

Now, comparing these:

Even the heaviest elephant is around 12,000 kg, which is 12 tons, and that's exceptional. A typical large elephant is 6,000 kg.

A blue whale, even a small one, might be around 50,000 kg, but adults are usually over 100,000 kg.

So, 6,000 kg vs. 100,000 kg – that's a huge difference. The blue whale is about 16 times heavier than an elephant on average.

I can think in tons to make it easier.

- Elephant: 5 to 7 tons (average)

- Blue whale: 100 to 150 tons (average)

Clearly, a blue whale is much heavier.

The question says "an elephant" and "a blue whale," so it's general, but we should consider typical representatives.

Also, there are different species. For elephants, African elephants are larger than Asian elephants. But even the largest African elephant is not close to a blue whale.

Similarly, for blue whales, they are all massive.

Is there any elephant that could be heavier than a small blue whale? Blue whale calves might be smaller, but the question probably refers to adults, as we usually compare adult animals.

The question doesn't specify age, but in such contexts, it's implied to be mature animals.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the typical weight range for an adult elephant.

   - African elephant: 4,000 to 6,800 kg (4.4 to 7.5 tons)

   - Asian elephant: 3,000 to 5,000 kg (3.3 to 5.5 tons) – smaller.

   Since the question says "an elephant," and African is larger, we should use that for comparison, but even then, it's lighter.

2. Identify the typical weight range for an adult blue whale.

   - Blue whale: 70,000 to 150,000 kg (77 to 165 tons), with average around 100,000 to 120,000 kg.

3. Compare the maximums:

   - Heaviest recorded elephant: about 10,400 kg (from what I recall, but let's verify mentally). Actually, the heaviest was estimated at 12,000 kg or so.

   - Heaviest blue whale: over 170,000 kg.

   So, 12,000 kg vs. 170,000 kg – blue whale is heavier.

4. Compare minimums:

   - Smallest adult elephant, say a female Asian elephant, might be 2,700 kg.

   - Smallest adult blue whale? I think they are still huge, but perhaps around 50,000 kg for a young adult or something. But generally, adults start from about 70,000 kg.

   Even 2,700 kg vs. 70,000 kg – blue whale is heavier.

Therefore, in all cases, a blue whale is heavier than an elephant.

So, the answer should be no, an elephant is not heavier than a blue whale.

The question is: "Is an elephant heavier than a blue whale?" So, if elephant is not heavier, then no.

Final answer: No.

But let me make sure there's no trick. Is there any elephant species or individual that could be heavier? Like prehistoric elephants, but the question is about present-day animals, I assume.

Also, blue whales are consistently the heaviest.

I recall that the blue whale is not only the largest animal alive but also the heaviest known animal ever, including dinosaurs.

Some dinosaurs like Argentinosaurus might have been longer, but blue whales are heavier.

So, no issue.

Step-by-step:

- Step 1: Determine average weight of elephant: approximately 5,000 kg for a large one.

- Step 2: Determine average weight of blue whale: approximately 140,000 kg.

- Step 3: Compare: 5,000 kg < 140,000 kg, so elephant is lighter.

- Step 4: Therefore, elephant is not heavier than blue whale.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine whether an elephant is heavier than a blue whale, I need to compare the typical weights of these animals. I'll use reliable biological data for adult individuals, as the question likely refers to mature animals in a general sense. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the typical weight range for an elephant:**
   - Elephants come in different species, but the largest and most commonly referenced is the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana).
   - Adult male African bush elephants typically weigh between **4,500 kg and 6,800 kg (5 to 7.5 tons)**.
   - The heaviest recorded African elephant weighed about **10,400 kg (11.5 tons)**, but this is exceptional.
   - For comparison, Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are smaller, with males averaging **3,500 to 5,500 kg (3.9 to 6.1 tons)**.
   - Since the question says "an elephant," I'll use the African elephant as the benchmark, as it is the largest land animal and represents the upper limit for elephant weight.

2. **Identify the typical weight range for a blue whale:**
   - Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) are the largest animals on Earth, living in oceans.
   - Adult blue whales typically weigh between **100,000 kg and 150,000 kg (110 to 165 tons)**.
   - The heaviest reliably recorded blue whale weighed about **173,000 kg (190 tons)**.
   - Even smaller or younger adult blue whales rarely weigh less than **70,000 kg (77 tons)**, as they are massive from birth (calves weigh about 2,700 kg at birth but grow rapidly).

3. **Compare the weights directly:**
   - Minimum comparison: The lightest adult African elephant (e.g., a small female) might weigh around **4,000 kg**, while the lightest adult blue whale is still at least **70,000 kg**. Thus, 4,000 kg < 70,000 kg.
   - Average comparison: A typical large male African elephant weighs about **6,000 kg**, while a typical adult blue whale weighs about **140,000 kg**. Thus, 6,000 kg < 140,000 kg.
   - Maximum comparison: The heaviest recorded elephant was **10,400 kg**, while the heaviest recorded blue whale was **173,000 kg**. Thus, 10,400 kg < 173,000 kg.
   - In all scenarios, the blue whale is significantly heavier—by a factor of 15 to 20 times on average.

4. **Consider any potential exceptions:**
   - There are no known elephant species or individuals (including extinct relatives like mammoths) that approach the weight of a blue whale. For example, the largest prehistoric elephant, Palaeoloxodon namadicus, is estimated to have weighed up to **22,000 kg (24 tons)**, which is still far less than even a small blue whale.
   - Age or health could affect individual weights, but adult blue whales are always heavier than adult elephants in typical biological contexts.
   - The question does not specify species, age, or other factors, so the comparison is based on standard adult representatives.

**Conclusion:** Based on the weight data, an elephant is not heavier than a blue whale. The blue whale is consistently and significantly heavier in all realistic comparisons.

**Final Answer: No**
