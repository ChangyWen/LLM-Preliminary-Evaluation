*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Australia larger in area than Russia?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Russia is the largest country in the world by land area, and Australia is also quite large, but I think Russia is bigger. Let me recall the actual areas.

From memory, Russia's total area is about 17 million square kilometers. I think it's 17,098,242 square kilometers to be precise. And Australia is around 7.6 million square kilometers. Australia is a continent, but it's smaller than Russia.

I should confirm the areas. Since this is a reasoning process, I can think about general knowledge.

Russia spans across Europe and Asia, covering a vast territory from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean. Australia is an island continent, mostly covered by desert.

Now, to be accurate, let's recall the exact figures.

Russia's area: I think it's approximately 17.1 million km².

Australia's area: I believe it's about 7.692 million km². I'm not entirely sure, but I know it's less than 10 million.

There's also the consideration of whether we're talking about land area or total area including water bodies. But for country comparisons, it's usually land area or total area including inland waters.

Russia has a lot of land, and Australia is surrounded by ocean, so its land area might be comparable, but still smaller.

I think I should look this up, but since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll use what I know.

Another way: I remember that Canada is the second largest, then China or the USA, and Australia is sixth or seventh.

List of countries by area:

1. Russia - 17,098,242 km²

2. Canada - 9,984,670 km²

3. United States - 9,833,517 km² (including territories)

4. China - 9,596,961 km²

5. Brazil - 8,515,767 km²

6. Australia - 7,692,024 km²

Yes, that sounds right. So Australia is sixth, and Russia is first with more than double the area of Australia.

17 million vs 7.6 million, so Russia is larger by about 9.4 million km², which is huge.

Therefore, Australia is not larger than Russia; Russia is larger.

The question is "Is Australia larger than Russia?" So the answer should be no.

But let me double-check the areas to be sure.

I can think about it comparatively. For example, Russia covers about 1/8 of the world's land area, while Australia is about 5% or something.

World land area is about 148 million km², so Russia is 17/148 ≈ 11.5%, Australia is 7.7/148 ≈ 5.2%, so yes, Russia is bigger.

Also, geographically, Russia extends over 11 time zones, while Australia has only 3, indicating its smaller size.

So, all evidence points to Russia being larger.

Therefore, Australia is not larger than Russia.

Final answer: No.

But the question says "larger in area," so I think it's clear.

Just to be thorough, is there any source that might say otherwise? I don't think so. Sometimes people include coastal waters or exclusive economic zones, but for country area, it's standard to use land area.

Australia might have a large exclusive economic zone because it's an island, but that's maritime area, not land area. The question specifies "area," which in this context means land area.

The question says "larger in area," which for countries typically means total surface area including land and inland waters.

But in any case, Russia has more land.

Australia's total area including territorial waters might be different, but I think for comparison, we use the standard figures.

According to CIA World Factbook or similar sources:

Russia: total area 17,098,242 sq km

Australia: total area 7,741,220 sq km (I think this includes some islands, but still less).

I think Australia is about 7.692 million km² land area, and total area might be similar since it's a continent.

Whereas Russia has land area of about 16.4 million km² or something? No, the 17 million includes inland waters like lakes.

Standard figures:

- Russia: 17,098,246 km² (land + water within borders)

- Australia: 7,692,024 km² (land area; since it's an island, water area is minimal or not counted in the same way)

Actually, for Australia, the total area is often given as the land area because there are no large inland seas, whereas Russia has areas like the Caspian Sea, but it's included.

But in any case, 7.7 million vs 17.1 million, no
