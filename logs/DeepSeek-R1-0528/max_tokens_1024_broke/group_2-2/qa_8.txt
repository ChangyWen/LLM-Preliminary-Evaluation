*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the Gobi Desert hotter than the Sahara Desert?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that both are deserts, but they have different characteristics. The Sahara is in Africa, and it's the largest hot desert in the world. The Gobi Desert is in Asia, covering parts of northern China and southern Mongolia.

Now, to compare their temperatures, I should look at average temperatures or record highs. I recall that the Sahara is extremely hot; it's known for having some of the highest temperatures on Earth. For example, places like Death Valley are often cited, but Death Valley is in North America. The Sahara has areas that get very hot, like in Algeria or Libya, where temperatures can exceed 50°C (122°F).

The Gobi Desert, on the other hand, is a cold desert. I think it has more extreme temperature variations between summer and winter. In summer, it can get hot, but not as hot as the Sahara. In winter, it can be very cold, with temperatures dropping below freezing.

Let me think about specific temperature data. I don't have exact numbers memorized, but I can reason based on general knowledge.

- The Sahara Desert: Average high temperatures in summer can be around 38-40°C (100-104°F), and it can reach up to 58°C (136°F) in some places, like in El Azizia, Libya, but that record was disputed. Still, it's consistently very hot.

- The Gobi Desert: I believe the average summer temperatures are lower. I think it's around 30-35°C (86-95°F) for highs, but it can get colder at night. Also, because it's at a higher latitude and altitude, it doesn't get as hot as the Sahara.

The Gobi Desert is located on a plateau, so it's higher in elevation. Parts of it are around 900 to 1500 meters above sea level, which would make it cooler than low-lying deserts like the Sahara. The Sahara has areas below sea level, like the Qattara Depression, but most of it is low, hot desert.

Sahara's elevation varies, but it has vast areas that are hot and dry. The Gobi, being in Mongolia and China, experiences continental climate with cold winters and warm summers, but not extremely hot like the Sahara.

I should confirm with some data. Since I'm an AI, I can access general knowledge up to my training data.

From what I know:

- The highest temperature recorded in the Sahara is around 55°C (131°F) in Kebili, Tunisia, or similar.

- For the Gobi, the highest recorded temperature is lower. I think it's around 40-45°C (104-113°F) in some areas, but not as high as the Sahara.

Also, on average, the Sahara is hotter. For instance, average July temperatures in the Sahara can be 35-40°C (95-104°F), while in the Gobi, average July temperatures are around 25-30°C (77-86°F) in many parts. I need to be precise.

Let me think about specific locations:

- In the Sahara: Timbuktu, Mali, average high in June is about 42°C (108°F).

- In the Gobi: Dalanzadgad, Mongolia, average high in July is about 31°C (88°F). That's significantly cooler.

Moreover, the Gobi is known for its cold winters, with temperatures dropping to -40°C (-40°F), while the Sahara rarely gets that cold; winter lows might be around 10-15°C (50-59°F) in some areas.

But the question is specifically about "hotter," so I should focus on summer or peak temperatures.

The question says "hotter," which might imply average temperature or maximum temperature. I think it's safe to say that the Sahara has higher peak temperatures and higher average temperatures in summer.

Let me see if there's any part of the Gobi that gets as hot as the Sahara. I don't think so, because of the geography.

The Gobi is a rain shadow desert, formed by the Himalayas blocking moisture, but it's also at higher latitudes, around 40-45 degrees north, while the Sahara is closer to the equator, around 15-30 degrees north. So, the Sahara receives more direct sunlight, making it hotter.

Therefore, overall, the Sahara is hotter than the Gobi Desert.

But just to be thorough, let's consider if there are exceptions. For example, on a particular day, the Gobi might be hotter, but on average, no.

Also, the Sahara has larger areas of extreme heat.

I think I'm confident in saying that the Sahara is hotter.

Final answer should be No, the
