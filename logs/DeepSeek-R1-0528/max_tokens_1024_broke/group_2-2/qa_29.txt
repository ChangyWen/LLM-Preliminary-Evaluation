First, the question is: "Is the wavelength of blue light longer than that of red light?" I need to answer with a step-by-step reasoning process and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I recall that visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. Red light and blue light are at opposite ends of the visible spectrum.

Let me think about the order of colors in the visible spectrum. It goes from red to violet, with red having the longest wavelength and violet having the shortest. Blue is closer to violet, so it should have a shorter wavelength than red.

The visible spectrum ranges from about 400 nanometers (nm) for violet to 700 nm for red. Specifically:

- Violet light: around 400 nm

- Blue light: around 475 nm

- Green light: around 510 nm

- Yellow light: around 580 nm

- Orange light: around 620 nm

- Red light: around 650-700 nm

I should confirm the exact wavelengths. From memory:

- Red light: approximately 620-750 nm

- Orange: 590-620 nm

- Yellow: 570-590 nm

- Green: 495-570 nm

- Blue: 450-495 nm

- Violet: 380-450 nm

So, for blue light, the wavelength is roughly 450 to 495 nm, and for red light, it's about 620 to 750 nm. Therefore, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

The question is: "Is the wavelength of blue light longer than that of red light?" Based on this, blue light has a shorter wavelength, not longer. So, the answer should be no.

Let me make sure I'm not confusing wavelength with frequency. I know that wavelength and frequency are inversely related by the speed of light: c = f * λ, where c is speed of light, f is frequency, λ is wavelength.

Since c is constant, if wavelength is longer, frequency is lower, and vice versa.

In the visible spectrum, red light has the longest wavelength and lowest frequency, while violet has the shortest wavelength and highest frequency. Blue is closer to violet, so it has shorter wavelength and higher frequency compared to red.

Therefore, blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light.

So, to answer the question: Is blue wavelength longer than red? No, it's shorter.

Final answer should be No.

Now, for the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall that visible light consists of different colors with varying wavelengths.

2. The visible spectrum ranges from red (longest wavelength) to violet (shortest wavelength).

3. Blue light is near the violet end, so it has a shorter wavelength.

4. Red light is at the opposite end, with the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum.

5. Therefore, the wavelength of blue light is shorter than that of red light.

6. Hence, the statement "the wavelength of blue light is longer than that of red light" is false.

Answer: No.

I should also include the approximate wavelengths for clarity.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The electromagnetic spectrum shows that for visible light, wavelength decreases from red to violet.

- Red light has wavelengths approximately between 620 nm and 750 nm.

- Blue light has wavelengths approximately between 450 nm and 495 nm.

- Since 450-495 nm is less than 620-750 nm, blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light.

- Therefore, blue light does not have a longer wavelength; red light has a longer wavelength.

Answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the electromagnetic spectrum**: Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. The spectrum ranges from red (longest wavelength) to violet (shortest wavelength) within the visible range.

2. **Recall the order of visible light colors**: The visible spectrum is typically ordered as follows, from longest to shortest wavelength:
   - Red
   - Orange
   - Yellow
   - Green
   - Blue
   - Violet

3. **Compare approximate wavelengths**:
   - Red light has wavelengths in the range of approximately **620–750 nanometers (nm)**.
   - Blue light has wavelengths in the range of approximately **450–495 nm**.
   - Since the maximum wavelength for blue light (495 nm) is less than the minimum wavelength for red light (620 nm), blue light consistently has a shorter wavelength than red light.

4. **Consider the inverse relationship with frequency**: Wavelength and frequency are inversely related by the equation \( c = f \lambda \), where \( c \) is the speed of light (constant). Red light has a longer wavelength and lower frequency, while blue light has a shorter wavelength and higher frequency. This confirms that blue light cannot have a longer wavelength than red light.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the electromagnetic spectrum properties, blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light. Therefore, the statement that
