*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the atomic number of carbon higher than that of oxygen?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I recall that the atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It defines the element.

Now, I need the atomic numbers for carbon and oxygen.

Carbon is element 6. That means its atomic number is 6.

Oxygen is element 8. So its atomic number is 8.

I should confirm this. The periodic table starts with hydrogen (1), helium (2), lithium (3), beryllium (4), boron (5), carbon (6), nitrogen (7), oxygen (8), and so on. Yes, carbon is 6, oxygen is 8.

So, atomic number of carbon is 6, and atomic number of oxygen is 8.

Now, is 6 higher than 8? No, 6 is less than 8. Higher would mean greater than, so 6 is not higher than 8; it's lower.

The question says "higher than," which means greater than. So, is carbon's atomic number greater than oxygen's? 6 > 8? False.

Therefore, the answer should be No.

Let me make sure there's no trick here. Is there any isotope or something? No, atomic number is fixed for an element; it doesn't change with isotopes. Isotopes have different mass numbers but same atomic number.

Carbon always has atomic number 6, oxygen always has 8.

So, clearly, 6 < 8, so carbon has a lower atomic number, not higher.

Final answer: No.

The question asks to show step-by-step reasoning and then the final answer.

So, my reasoning:

1. Atomic number is the number of protons in an atom.

2. The atomic number of carbon is 6.

3. The atomic number of oxygen is 8.

4. Comparing 6 and 8, 6 is less than 8.

5. Therefore, the atomic number of carbon is not higher than that of oxygen; it is lower.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand Atomic Number**: The atomic number of an element is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It uniquely identifies the element and determines its position in the periodic table.

2. **Identify Carbon's Atomic Number**: Carbon is an element with the symbol "C". From the periodic table, carbon has an atomic number of **6**. This is a fixed property, meaning all carbon atoms have 6 protons.

3. **Identify Oxygen's Atomic Number**: Oxygen is an element with the symbol "O". From the periodic table, oxygen has an atomic number of **8**. This is also a fixed property, meaning all oxygen atoms have 8 protons.

4. **Compare the Atomic Numbers**:  
   - Carbon's atomic number: 6  
   - Oxygen's atomic number: 8  
   - Compare the values: 6 < 8 (6 is less than 8).

5. **Evaluate the Question**: The question asks if the atomic number of carbon is higher than that of oxygen. "Higher than" means greater than. Since 6 is not greater than 8 (it is less), the statement is false.

6. **Consider Isotopes (if applicable)**: Atomic number is independent of isotopes. Isotopes vary in neutron count (affecting mass number), but the atomic number (proton count) remains constant. For example, carbon-12 and carbon-14 both have atomic number 6, and oxygen-16 and oxygen-18 both have atomic number 8. This does not change the comparison.

### Final Answer:
No
