First, the question is: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. It ranges from 0 to 14. A pH less than 7 is acidic, 7 is neutral, and greater than 7 is basic.

Water is neutral, so its pH is 7. That's standard for pure water at 25°C.

Lemon juice is acidic because it contains citric acid. I think lemon juice has a pH around 2 or 3. Let me recall: yes, lemon juice is quite acidic, typically between 2 and 3.

So, if water has a pH of 7 and lemon juice has a pH of about 2-3, that means lemon juice has a lower pH than water because lower pH means more acidic.

The question is: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?" So, if lemon juice has a lower pH, then water's pH is not lower; it's higher.

Let me denote:

- pH of water = 7

- pH of lemon juice ≈ 2.5 (let's say, as an average)

Since 7 > 2.5, the pH of water is higher than that of lemon juice. Therefore, the pH of water is not lower; it's higher.

So, the answer should be No.

But let me make sure about the values. Is pure water always pH 7? In theory, yes, but tap water might vary, but I think for this context, we're talking about pure water. Similarly, lemon juice pH might vary, but it's consistently acidic.

Also, pH scale is logarithmic, so a difference of 1 pH unit means a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration. But for comparison, we don't need that; we just need the numerical values.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. pH is a scale from 0 to 14 that measures acidity or basicity.

2. A lower pH indicates higher acidity, while a higher pH indicates higher basicity.

3. Pure water has a pH of 7, which is neutral.

4. Lemon juice is acidic due to citric acid and other components, with a typical pH range of 2 to 3.

5. Since 7 is greater than 3 or 2, the pH of water is higher than the pH of lemon juice.

6. Therefore, the pH of water is not lower than that of lemon juice; it is higher.

Final answer: No.

The question says "lower than", so if water pH is not lower, it's No.

To be precise:

Is pH_water < pH_lemon_juice?

pH_water = 7

pH_lemon_juice ≈ 2.5

7 < 2.5? False. So No.

Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand pH Scale**: The pH scale measures how acidic or basic a solution is, ranging from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral (like pure water), values below 7 are acidic, and values above 7 are basic. Lower pH values indicate higher acidity.

2. **pH of Water**: Pure water at 25°C has a pH of 7. This is because water dissociates slightly into H⁺ and OH⁻ ions, resulting in a neutral solution. For this comparison, we assume pure water, as it is the standard reference.

3. **pH of Lemon Juice**: Lemon juice is acidic due to its high citric acid content. The typical pH range for lemon juice is between 2.0 and 3.0, with an average of around 2.5. This makes it strongly acidic.

4. **Numerical Comparison**: 
   - pH of water = 7.0
   - pH of lemon juice ≈ 2.5 (using a representative value from the typical range)
   - Compare the values: 7.0 is greater than 2.5, meaning the pH of water is higher than the pH of lemon juice.

5. **Answer the Question**: The question asks if the pH of water is lower than that of lemon juice. Since 7.0 is not lower than 2.5 (it is higher), the answer is no.

**Final Answer: No**
