*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Does an elephant have a larger heart than a blue whale?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, and elephants are the largest land animals. So, intuitively, a blue whale should have a larger heart because it's much bigger overall.

But I should look for specific facts about their heart sizes. I recall that a blue whale's heart is enormous. I think it's about the size of a small car or something like that. Let me think more precisely.

From what I remember, a blue whale's heart can weigh around 400 to 500 pounds (about 180 to 230 kilograms). I should use metric units for accuracy.

Let me confirm: Adult blue whales can have hearts that weigh up to 400 kg (about 900 pounds). I think I've heard that. But I need reliable information.

Now, for an elephant: African elephants are the largest, and their hearts are big too. I think an elephant's heart weighs around 12 to 21 kg (about 26 to 46 pounds). I'm not entirely sure.

Let me think step by step.

Step 1: Compare the sizes of the animals.

- Blue whale: Can grow up to 30 meters (100 feet) long and weigh up to 150,000 kg (330,000 pounds).

- Elephant: African bush elephant can be up to 7,000 kg (15,000 pounds) and about 3-4 meters tall.

So, blue whales are significantly larger.

Step 2: Heart size relative to body size.

Hearts scale with body size, but not necessarily linearly. Larger animals might have proportionally smaller hearts due to efficiency, but I think for mammals, heart size is roughly proportional.

I should look for actual heart weights.

I recall that a blue whale's heart is one of the largest known, and it's often said to be the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, but that might be an exaggeration. Actually, I think it's about 5 feet long and 4 feet wide, weighing around 400 kg.

Upon second thought, I think a blue whale's heart weighs about 600 kg. I need to be careful.

Let me use facts I know:

- Blue whale heart: Approximately 400 to 500 kg (I've seen 400 kg cited often).

- Elephant heart: For an adult African elephant, it's about 12 to 20 kg. Let's say average 15-20 kg.

That would mean the blue whale's heart is much larger.

But let's get specific.

I remember that the blue whale has a heart that can pump about 220 liters of blood per beat, and it weighs as much as a grand piano or something.

Similarly, for elephants, their heart is large for a land animal but not compared to whales.

Perhaps I should consider the ratio.

But the question is about absolute size, not relative. It says "larger heart," meaning size or weight, I assume.

The question doesn't specify, but in biology, when comparing organs, we often mean mass or volume.

I think weight is a good measure.

So, let's establish:

Blue whale heart weight: I think it's around 180 kg to 400 kg. I've seen varying numbers.

Upon recollection, I think a typical blue whale heart is about 200 kg. But let's go with a reliable source.

Since I'm an AI, I can access general knowledge.

Standard fact: The blue whale's heart is the largest of any animal, weighing about 400 pounds to 600 pounds? No.

400 pounds is about 180 kg, but I think it's more.

I think it's 400 kg. Let me think: 1 kg is 2.2 pounds, so 400 kg is 880 pounds.

I found online in my memory: Blue whale heart weighs up to 900 kg? That seems too much.

No: Adult blue whale heart is approximately 180 kg (400 lbs) to 230 kg (500 lbs). I think that's standard.

For example, National Geographic or similar sources say around 400 lbs, which is 181 kg.

But I've also heard 600 kg, which might be for the largest whales.

Let's take an average: Say 200 kg for blue whale heart.

Now for elephant: African elephant heart weighs about 12 to 21 kg. Sources say up to 22 kg for large males.

For instance, a 6,000 kg elephant might have a 20 kg heart.

Whereas a 100,000 kg blue whale has a 200 kg heart or more.

So, 20 kg vs 200 kg, so blue whale heart is ten times heavier.

Therefore, elephant heart is smaller.

But is there any chance elephant has larger heart? No, that seems impossible.

Perhaps I should consider the size in terms of volume or dimensions.

But weight is sufficient.
