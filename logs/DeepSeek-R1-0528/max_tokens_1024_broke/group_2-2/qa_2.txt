*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a yes or no answer.

I know that Mount Everest is generally considered the tallest mountain in the world. But I should confirm the heights to be precise.

Mount Everest's height is often cited as 8,848 meters above sea level. I think that's the standard figure.

Now, K2 is another high mountain, and it's the second tallest. I believe K2 is around 8,611 meters. I need to recall the exact heights.

Let me think: Mount Everest is in the Himalayas on the border between Nepal and China, and K2 is in the Karakoram range on the border between Pakistan and China.

The height of Mount Everest: The official height is 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) as recognized by Nepal and China. There was a recent update in 2020 where China and Nepal agreed on a new height of 8,848.86 meters, but for simplicity, we often use 8,848 meters.

K2's height: I think it's 8,611 meters (28,251 feet). Yes, that sounds right.

So, comparing 8,848 meters for Everest and 8,611 meters for K2, clearly Everest is taller.

But to be thorough, I should consider if there are any different measurements or controversies. For example, sometimes people debate whether Mauna Kea is taller if measured from base to summit, but that's underwater. The question is about height above sea level, I assume, since that's the standard for comparing mountain heights.

The question doesn't specify, but in common parlance, "taller" for mountains refers to elevation above sea level.

K2 is known for being a more difficult climb, but that doesn't affect its height.

Let me double-check the heights:

- Mount Everest: 8,848 meters

- K2: 8,611 meters

Source: I recall this from geography. If I need to be precise, I can think about reliable sources, but since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll go with standard knowledge.

Perhaps I should calculate the difference: 8,848 - 8,611 = 237 meters. So Everest is taller by 237 meters.

Therefore, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.

The question is: "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?" So the answer should be no.

But let's make sure about the heights. Is there any chance that K2 is taller?

I think I remember that K2 was sometimes thought to be close, but no, Everest is definitively taller.

Another thing: there's a mountain called Kangchenjunga, which is also over 8,500 meters, but still less than Everest.

K2 is the second highest at 8,611 m, and Everest is first at 8,848 m.

Yes.

For step-by-step reasoning:

Step 1: Recall the standard elevation of Mount Everest. It is 8,848 meters above sea level.

Step 2: Recall the standard elevation of K2. It is 8,611 meters above sea level.

Step 3: Compare the two elevations: 8,848 meters vs. 8,611 meters.

Step 4: Since 8,848 > 8,611, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

Therefore, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.

Final answer: No.

The question is "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?" so the answer is no.

To be complete, I should state the heights clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the question**: The question asks whether K2 is taller than Mount Everest. This requires comparing their heights above sea level, as this is the standard metric for measuring mountain heights.

2. **Recall the height of Mount Everest**:  
   - Mount Everest is widely recognized as the tallest mountain in the world.  
   - Its official height, as jointly declared by Nepal and China in 2020, is **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)** above sea level. For simplicity, it is often rounded to **8,849 meters** or **8,848 meters** in general references. I will use the precise figure of **8,848.86 meters** for accuracy.

3. **Recall the height of K2**:  
   - K2, also known as Mount Godwin-Austen, is the second-tallest mountain in the world.  
   - Its official height is **8,611 meters (28,251 feet)** above sea level, as measured by modern surveys (e.g., by the Italian Ardito Desio expedition in 1954 and confirmed with satellite data).

4. **Compare the heights**:  
   - Mount Everest: **8,848.86 meters**  
   - K2: **8,611 meters**  
   - Subtract
