*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is China located east of Japan?" I need to reason step-by-step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I should recall the geographical locations of China and Japan. Both are countries in East Asia. China is a large country, and Japan is an island nation to the east of the Asian mainland.

Now, let's think about the relative positions. Japan consists of several islands: Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku, among others. It's situated in the Pacific Ocean, east of the Korean Peninsula and China.

China is on the mainland of Asia. Its eastern coast faces the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea. Japan is located to the east of that, across the sea.

Specifically, if I consider the longitude, Japan is generally at a higher longitude than China. Longitude increases as you go east, so places with higher longitude are further east.

For example, the capital of China is Beijing. The coordinates of Beijing are approximately 39°N, 116°E. The capital of Japan is Tokyo, which is about 35°N, 139°E.

Comparing the longitudes: Beijing is at 116°E, and Tokyo is at 139°E. Since 139°E is greater than 116°E, Tokyo is east of Beijing. Therefore, Japan is east of China.

But the question is whether China is east of Japan. If Japan is east of China, then China must be west of Japan, not east.

Let me rephrase: If A is east of B, then B is west of A.

In this case, since Japan is east of China, China is west of Japan. Therefore, China is not east of Japan; it's west.

I should consider the entire countries, not just capitals. China spans a large area from about 73°E to 135°E longitude. The westernmost point of China is in Xinjiang, around 73°E, and the easternmost is in Heilongjiang, around 135°E.

Japan's main islands range from about 129°E to 146°E. For example, Kyushu is around 130°E, and Hokkaido is up to 145°E or so.

So, the easternmost point of China is around 135°E, and the westernmost point of Japan is around 129°E (considering the main islands; some remote islands might be different, but I think for this context, we use the main territories).

If China's easternmost point is at 135°E and Japan's westernmost point is at 129°E, then 135°E is greater than 129°E, meaning that part of China is east of part of Japan? That might be confusing.

Let's think carefully.

Japan's westernmost point is generally considered to be Cape Irizaki on Yonaguni Island, which is around 122°E or something? I need to be precise.

Actually, Yonaguni Island is part of Okinawa Prefecture, and it's at about 122°56'E. But is that considered? Sometimes people refer to the main islands.

To avoid confusion, let's take standard reference points.

The eastern coast of China, say Shanghai, is at about 121°E. Tokyo is at 139°E. Since 121°E < 139°E, Shanghai is west of Tokyo.

The easternmost point of China is Fuyuan County in Heilongjiang, at about 134°40'E.

The westernmost point of Japan is Cape Irizaki on Yonaguni Island, which is at 122°56'E.

Now, comparing 134°40'E (China east) to 122°56'E (Japan west), 134.67°E > 122.93°E, so Fuyuan is east of Yonaguni.

But Yonaguni is a small island, and Fuyuan is on the mainland. However, geographically, since Yonaguni is part of Japan, and Fuyuan is part of China, technically, there is a point in China that is east of a point in Japan.

But that might not be the intent of the question. The question is about the relative position of the countries as a whole.

Typically, when we say "China is located east of Japan," we mean that the bulk of China is east of Japan or that China is positioned to the east relative to Japan.

But in reality, Japan is entirely east of the Asian mainland, including China.

Let me visualize a map. China is on the west, Japan is to the east, across the sea. So, China is west of Japan.

For example, from Tokyo, if you go west, you reach China. From Beijing, if you go east, you reach Japan.

Therefore, China is not east of Japan; it is west of Japan.

But due to the
