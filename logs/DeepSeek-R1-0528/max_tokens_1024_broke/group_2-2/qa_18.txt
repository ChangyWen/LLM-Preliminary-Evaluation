*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are going to compare two distances:
 1. The average distance from Earth to the Moon.
 2. The average distance from Earth to the Sun.

 Known astronomical facts:
 - The average distance from Earth to the Moon is about 384,400 kilometers (or 1.28 light-seconds).
 - The average distance from Earth to the Sun is about 149.6 million kilometers (also known as 1 Astronomical Unit, AU).

 Let's compare:
   Distance to the Moon: 384,400 km
   Distance to the Sun: 149,600,000 km

 Clearly, 149,600,000 km is much larger than 384,400 km.

 We can also write them in scientific notation for easier comparison:
   Moon: 3.844 × 10^5 km
   Sun: 1.496 × 10^8 km

 Since the exponent of 10 for the Sun (8) is greater than that for the Moon (5), we know that the Sun is much farther.

 Alternatively, we can compute the ratio:
   Distance to Sun / Distance to Moon = 149,600,000 / 384,400 ≈ 389.2

 This means the Sun is about 389 times farther away than the Moon.

 Therefore, the distance from Earth to the Sun is greater than the distance from Earth to the Moon.

 Final answer: Yes, the distance from Earth to the Sun is greater.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the distances:**
   - The average distance from Earth to the Moon is approximately **384,400 kilometers**.
   - The average distance from Earth to the Sun is approximately **149,600,000 kilometers** (1 Astronomical Unit).

2. **Compare the distances numerically:**
   - Earth to Moon: 384,400 km
   - Earth to Sun: 149,600,000 km
   - Clearly, 149,600,000 is much larger than 384,400.

3. **Verify with scientific notation:**
   - Earth to Moon: \(3.844 \times 10^5\) km
   - Earth to Sun: \(1.496 \times 10^8\) km
   - Comparing exponents: \(10^8\) (100,000,000) is 1,000 times larger than \(10^5\) (100,000). Even considering the coefficients (1.496 vs. 3.844), the Sun's distance is overwhelmingly larger.

4. **Calculate the ratio:**
   - Ratio = \(\frac{\text{Earth to Sun}}{\text{Earth to Moon}} = \frac{149,600,000}{384,400} \approx 389.2\)
   - This means the Sun is about **389 times farther** than the Moon.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance from Earth to the Sun is significantly greater than the distance from Earth to the Moon.

**Final Answer: Yes**
