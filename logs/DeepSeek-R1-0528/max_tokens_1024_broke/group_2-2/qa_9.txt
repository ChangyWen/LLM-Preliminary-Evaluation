*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the Arctic colder than Antarctica?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the Arctic is the region around the North Pole, which is mostly ocean surrounded by land. Antarctica is the continent around the South Pole, covered by ice and surrounded by ocean.

Temperature differences: Antarctica is generally colder than the Arctic. I think I've heard that Antarctica holds the record for the coldest temperatures on Earth.

Reasons why Antarctica might be colder:

1. **Elevation:** Antarctica is a high continent with an average elevation of about 2,500 meters (8,200 feet). Higher elevation means colder temperatures because the air is thinner and less able to retain heat.

2. **Land vs. Ocean:** Antarctica is a landmass covered in ice, while the Arctic is an ocean covered by sea ice. Land heats and cools more quickly than water, but in this case, since it's covered in ice, it might retain cold better. Water has a higher heat capacity, so the ocean in the Arctic might moderate temperatures a bit, making it less extreme.

3. **Isolation:** Antarctica is isolated by the Southern Ocean, which allows a circumpolar current that isolates it from warmer waters, keeping it cold. The Arctic is more connected to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, so warmer waters can influence it.

4. **Albedo Effect:** Both have high albedo because of ice, but Antarctica's ice sheet is thicker and more permanent, reflecting more sunlight.

Now, for specific temperatures:

- The coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth was in Antarctica. At the Soviet Vostok Station on July 21, 1983, it was -89.2°C (-128.6°F).

- In the Arctic, the coldest recorded temperature is around -69.6°C (-93.3°F) in Greenland, which is part of the Arctic region. Greenland is often considered part of the Arctic, but technically, the Arctic includes the ocean and surrounding landmasses.

I should confirm the Arctic record. I think the lowest temperature in the Arctic was recorded in Verkhoyansk, Russia, but that might not be directly on the ice. Let me think carefully.

Standard comparison:

- Average winter temperatures: In Antarctica, at the South Pole, winter temperatures average around -60°C (-76°F). In the Arctic, at the North Pole, winter temperatures average around -30°C to -40°C (-22°F to -40°F), I think.

- Summer temperatures: Antarctica can get down to -20°C or -30°C in summer at the coast, but colder inland. Arctic summer temperatures can be around freezing or slightly above, especially at the edges.

But the question is about which is colder overall, so I should compare the extremes or averages.

Let me look for reliable sources in my knowledge.

I recall that Antarctica is colder because:

- It's higher: South Pole is at 2,835 meters (9,301 ft), while the North Pole is at sea level.

- It's a continent vs. an ocean: The Arctic Ocean acts as a heat reservoir, releasing heat in winter, whereas Antarctica's landmass cools more efficiently.

Also, Antarctica has less moisture, which means less cloud cover and more radiative cooling.

In terms of records:

- Antarctica: Vostok Station, -89.2°C

- Arctic: The lowest temperature in the Arctic is often cited as -69.6°C in Greenland at Klinck station or something similar. I think it's -67.8°C in Verkhoyansk, but Verkhoyansk is in Siberia, which is part of the Arctic Circle, but not on the ice cap.

To be fair, we should compare similar settings. For example, research stations.

At the South Pole, Amundsen-Scott Station, the coldest temperature is around -82.8°C.

At the North Pole, since it's floating ice, temperatures don't get as low; I think the lowest is around -50°C or so, but I'm not sure.

Actually, the coldest Arctic temperature is from ice cap locations like Greenland. Greenland's Summit Station recorded -69.6°C in 1991 or something.

But Antarctica's Vostok is colder at -89.2°C.

For averages:

- Annual mean temperature at South Pole: about -49.5°C

- Annual mean at North Pole: about -18°C to -20°C, I think.

That seems off. Let me think.

I remember that the average temperature in Antarctica is much lower.

According to scientific data:

- Antarctica: average temperature ranges from -10°C on the coast to -60°C inland.

- Arctic: average temperature is about -34°C in winter and can be above freezing in summer at the pole.

But to be precise.

I think it's well-established that Antarctica is colder
