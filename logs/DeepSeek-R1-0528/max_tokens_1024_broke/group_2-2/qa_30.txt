*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the average lifespan of a dog longer than that of a human?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that dogs and humans have different lifespans. Humans generally live longer than dogs, but I should confirm the average lifespans.

Recall the average lifespan of a dog. It varies by breed, but overall, the average lifespan of a dog is around 10 to 13 years. Smaller breeds tend to live longer, like 15 years or more, while larger breeds might only live 8 to 10 years. But as a general average, I think 10-13 years is commonly cited.

Now, for humans, the average lifespan globally is about 72-73 years, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In developed countries, it's higher, around 80 years, but I should use a global average for a fair comparison.

So, comparing 10-13 years for dogs to 72-73 years for humans, it's clear that humans live much longer.

But let me double-check these numbers. I should be precise.

For dogs: According to veterinary sources, the average lifespan of a dog is approximately 10-13 years. Some sources say 12 years is a good average.

For humans: The global average life expectancy at birth is about 73 years as of recent data (e.g., 2023 estimates). For example, WHO reported 73.4 years for 2019, and it might have increased slightly, but it's around there.

Therefore, 12 years (dog) vs. 73 years (human) â€“ no, 12 is less than 73, so dogs have a shorter lifespan.

The question is: "Is the average lifespan of a dog longer than that of a human?" So, if dog lifespan is longer than human, it would be yes, but in this case, it's not.

Let me phrase it: Average dog lifespan > average human lifespan?

From my knowledge, 12 < 73, so false. Dog lifespan is shorter.

But I should consider if there's any breed or exception. The question says "a dog," which probably means domestic dogs in general, not a specific type. Similarly, "human" means humans in general.

Also, lifespan can be affected by factors like healthcare, but we're talking averages.

Another thing: is "lifespan" here meaning life expectancy? I think so, average lifespan typically refers to life expectancy.

Perhaps I should look for reliable sources in my mind.

I remember that the Guinness World Records for oldest dog is around 29 years, while for humans it's 122 years. But that's maximum, not average.

For average, it's clear.

Perhaps in some contexts, but no, generally dogs have shorter lives.

Let me think step by step as instructed.

Step 1: Recall the average lifespan of a domestic dog.

- Based on various studies, the average is 10-13 years. I'll use 11.5 as a midpoint or something, but it's not necessary. Since the question is comparative, I can state ranges.

Step 2: Recall the average lifespan of a human.

- Global average life expectancy: approximately 73 years (e.g., from UN or WHO data).

Step 3: Compare the two.

- 10-13 years < 73 years.

- Therefore, the average lifespan of a dog is shorter than that of a human.

So, the answer to "Is it longer?" is no.

But let's make sure about the human average. Is it 73? Yes, for 2021, WHO reported 71.4 years for global life expectancy due to COVID impact, but it's around that range. Pre-COVID it was higher, but still above 70.

Dogs: American Kennel Club or similar sources say average is 10-13 years.

Some sources might say 12-15 for smaller dogs, but overall average is lower.

For example, a study might find 12 years as median or mean.

But it's consistently less than human lifespan.

Therefore, the average lifespan of a dog is not longer than that of a human; it is shorter.

So, final answer should be No.

The question says "show your reasoning and final answer (Yes or No)."

Reasoning: I have reasoned that dogs live about 10-13 years on average, while humans live about 73 years on average, so dogs have a shorter lifespan.

Thus, no, the average lifespan of a dog is not longer than that of a human.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether the average lifespan of a dog is longer than that of a human. This requires comparing the typical life expectancies of both species based on reliable data.

2. **Define Average Lifespan**: 
   - For dogs: The average lifespan varies by breed
