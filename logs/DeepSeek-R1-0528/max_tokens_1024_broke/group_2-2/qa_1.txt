*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is an elephant heavier than a blue whale?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that elephants are large land animals, and blue whales are the largest animals on Earth. But I should confirm the average weights.

Let me recall: An adult African elephant is one of the heaviest land animals. Male African elephants can weigh between 4,500 to 6,800 kilograms (kg). Let's use metric units for consistency.

Similarly, for blue whales, they are marine mammals and are much larger. An adult blue whale can weigh up to 150,000 kg or even more. I think the average is around 100,000 to 150,000 kg.

I should look for reliable figures. Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll use common knowledge from biology or general science.

Step 1: Find the average weight of an elephant.

- African bush elephant: males weigh about 6,000 kg on average, but it can vary.

- Asian elephants are smaller, around 4,000 kg for males.

The question says "an elephant," which might refer to the largest species, so I'll go with African elephant.

But to be precise, let's take the higher end. The heaviest recorded elephant was about 10,000 kg, but that's rare. Average is 5,000 to 6,000 kg.

Step 2: Find the average weight of a blue whale.

Blue whales are the heaviest animals known. They can weigh up to 180,000 kg, but the average adult is about 100,000 to 150,000 kg.

According to sources like National Geographic or WWF, blue whales weigh around 200,000 pounds, which is about 90,000 kg. Let me convert properly.

1 pound = 0.453592 kg

So, 200,000 pounds = 200,000 * 0.453592 â‰ˆ 90,718 kg. But I think they can be heavier.

I recall that blue whales can reach 30 meters in length and weigh up to 173 tonnes. 1 tonne = 1,000 kg, so 173 tonnes = 173,000 kg.

Average is often cited as 100,000 to 150,000 kg.

Now, compare to elephants: African elephant average weight is about 6,000 kg for males, females smaller.

So, 6,000 kg vs. 100,000 kg.

Clearly, 100,000 kg is much larger than 6,000 kg.

Even the heaviest elephant ever recorded was about 10,000 kg, and blue whales can be over 150,000 kg.

Therefore, a blue whale is heavier than an elephant.

The question is: "Is an elephant heavier than a blue whale?" So, if blue whale is heavier, then elephant is not heavier.

So, the answer should be no.

But let me make sure there's no trick. Are there any small species or something? No, blue whales are consistently larger.

Even compared to the largest extinct animals, blue whales are still the heaviest.

For example, some dinosaurs like Argentinosaurus might have been longer, but blue whales are heavier in terms of mass.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the typical weight range for an elephant: African elephants, the largest species, weigh between 4,500 to 6,800 kg for males, with an average of about 6,000 kg.

2. Identify the typical weight range for a blue whale: Blue whales weigh between 100,000 to 150,000 kg on average, with some reaching up to 180,000 kg.

3. Compare the weights: 6,000 kg (elephant) vs. 100,000 kg (blue whale). Since 6,000 < 100,000, the elephant is lighter.

4. Therefore, an elephant is not heavier than a blue whale.

Final answer: No.

The question says "heavier than," so the comparison is direct.

I think that's straightforward.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the question**: The question asks whether an elephant is heavier than a blue whale. I need to compare the average weights of these animals to determine the answer.

2. **Recall the average weight of an elephant**:
   - Elephants come in different species, with the African bush elephant being the largest and heaviest.
   - According to scientific sources (e.g., National Geographic, World Wildlife Fund), an adult male African elephant typically weighs between 4,500 kg and 6,800 kg (about 5 to 7.5 tons). The average weight is around 6,000 kg.
   - For this comparison, I'll use the upper end of the range (6,800 kg) to be conservative, as it represents the heaviest common weight for elephants. Rare individuals may weigh up to 10,000 kg
