*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine the death dates of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein to see who died later.

Isaac Newton: I know he was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution. He was born in 1643 and died in 1727. Let me confirm that. Yes, Newton was born on January 4, 1643, and died on March 31, 1727.

Albert Einstein: He was a physicist known for the theory of relativity. He was born in 1879 and died in 1955. Specifically, born on March 14, 1879, and died on April 18, 1955.

Now, I need to compare the death years: Newton died in 1727, and Einstein died in 1955.

1955 is much later than 1727. So, Einstein died after Newton.

To be thorough, let's look at the exact dates:

- Newton: March 31, 1727

- Einstein: April 18, 1955

The year 1955 is after 1727, so even without the months, it's clear. But just to be precise, 1955 minus 1727 is 228 years later. So, Einstein died much later.

The question is: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?" That means: Did Newton die after Einstein? Or in other words, is Newton's death date after Einstein's death date?

If Newton died later than Einstein, that would mean Newton's death is after Einstein's death. But from the dates, Newton died in 1727, Einstein in 1955, so Newton died earlier, not later.

Let me parse the question carefully.

"Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?"

This is asking if Newton's death occurred after Einstein's death.

Since Newton died in 1727 and Einstein in 1955, Newton died before Einstein, so Newton did not die later than Einstein. In fact, Einstein died later.

So, the answer should be no.

But let me make sure about the death dates.

I recall that there might be a calendar change, but Newton's death is recorded in the Gregorian calendar, I think. Newton was born and died in England, which adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752, after his death. But his death date is given as March 31, 1727, in the Julian calendar or something? No, typically, we use the Gregorian calendar for historical dates now.

Actually, Newton was born on December 25, 1642, in the Julian calendar, which is January 4, 1643, in Gregorian. Similarly, he died on March 20, 1726, in Julian or March 31, 1727, in Gregorian? I think I have it right.

Standard sources list Newton's death as March 31, 1727 (Gregorian calendar).

Einstein's death is April 18, 1955 (Gregorian).

So, 1727 vs. 1955, no issue.

Therefore, Newton died in 1727, Einstein in 1955, so Newton died earlier.

Thus, Isaac Newton did not die later than Albert Einstein; Einstein died later.

So, the answer is no.

The question says: "die later than" â€“ meaning if Newton died after Einstein, which is false.

Final answer should be no.

But let's see the reasoning steps.

Step 1: Recall Isaac Newton's death date.

- Isaac Newton died on March 31, 1727.

Step 2: Recall Albert Einstein's death date.

- Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955.

Step 3: Compare the death years.

- 1727 is earlier than 1955.

- Therefore, Newton died before Einstein.

Step 4: Specifically, since 1955 > 1727, Einstein died later.

Step 5: Answer the question: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?"

- Since Newton died before Einstein, he did not die later than Einstein.

- So, the answer is no.

I think that's clear.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Isaac Newton's death date:**
   - Isaac Newton, the English physicist and mathematician, died on **March 31, 1727**. This date is well-documented in historical records and is based on the Gregorian calendar, which is the standard calendar used today for such references.

2. **Identify Albert Einstein's death date:**
   - Albert Einstein, the German-born physicist known for the theory of relativity, died on **April 18, 1955**. This is also confirmed by historical sources and uses the Gregorian calendar.

3. **Compare the death years:**
   - Newton died in **1727**.
   - Einstein died in **1955**.
   - Since 1955 is numerically greater than 1727, Einstein died after Newton.

4. **Compare specific dates if necessary (though
