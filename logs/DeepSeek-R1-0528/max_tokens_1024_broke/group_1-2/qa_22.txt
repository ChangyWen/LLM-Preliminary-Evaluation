*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Dal-Tex Building, TX located south of Lake Martin, AL?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to figure out the locations of these two places. Dal-Tex Building is in Texas, and Lake Martin is in Alabama. Since they're in different states, I should think about their geographic coordinates, specifically latitude, because "south" refers to a lower latitude.

South means a lower latitude number. For example, if Dal-Tex has a lower latitude than Lake Martin, then it is south of it.

So, step 1: Find the latitude of Dal-Tex Building, TX.

Dal-Tex Building – I think this is in Dallas, Texas. I recall that the Dal-Tex Building is a historic building in Dallas, associated with the JFK assassination. Let me confirm that.

Upon a quick search in my knowledge, yes, the Dal-Tex Building is at 501 Elm Street, Dallas, TX. Now, what's its latitude? I need approximate coordinates.

Dallas, TX is around 32.78°N latitude. Let me be precise. I should look up the exact coordinates if possible, but since I'm reasoning, I can use general knowledge.

Dallas, TX latitude: approximately 32.7767°N.

Now, for Lake Martin, AL. Lake Martin is a reservoir in Alabama. Where is it exactly?

Lake Martin is in central Alabama, near the cities like Alexander City. Its latitude should be around... Alabama is north of Texas? No, Texas is west and partly south of Alabama? Let's think about the map.

Alabama is east of Texas, but in terms of latitude, both are in the southern US, but I need to compare.

Texas is larger, and Dallas is in the northern part of Texas, while Lake Martin is in Alabama, which is farther east but might be at a similar latitude or different.

I should find the latitude of Lake Martin.

Lake Martin, Alabama: I believe it's near Dadeville or Alexander City. Alexander City, AL has a latitude of about 32.94°N or something? Let me think.

Actually, let's recall: Montgomery, Alabama is about 32.36°N, but Lake Martin is north of Montgomery.

Lake Martin is in Tallapoosa County, Alabama. Alexander City is a nearby town, at approximately 32.94°N latitude.

I can use approximate values.

To be more accurate, let's assume:

- Dal-Tex Building, Dallas, TX: Latitude 32.78°N (since Dallas is at about 32.78°N)

- Lake Martin, AL: I need a specific point. Lake Martin is a large lake, so I should take a central point or a known location.

For simplicity, let's take the dam or something. But I think the city of Alexander City is often associated, at 32.941°N.

Alexander City, AL: Latitude 32.9444°N

Now, Dallas, TX: 32.7767°N

Compare: 32.7767°N vs 32.9444°N

Since latitude is measured in degrees north, a smaller number means farther south.

32.7767 is less than 32.9444, so Dallas is south of Alexander City.

But Alexander City is near Lake Martin, so Lake Martin should be around that latitude.

Lake Martin itself: let's find the coordinates.

Upon a quick mental search, Lake Martin's approximate center is about 32.65°N, 85.9°W or something? I think I have Alexander City wrong.

Let me correct.

Montgomery, AL: 32.3792°N

Birmingham, AL: 33.5207°N

Lake Martin is between, I think. Alexander City is about 32.94°N, which is north of Montgomery.

But let's confirm Lake Martin.

Lake Martin coordinates: I found online that the Martin Dam, which is on Lake Martin, is at approximately 32.65°N, 85.83°W or something. I need to recall.

Since I don't have real-time access, I'll use general knowledge.

Alabama's latitude ranges from about 30°N to 35°N. Lake Martin is in the central part, so around 32.5°N to 33°N.

Similarly, Dallas, TX is at 32.78°N.

Now, for Lake Martin, let's take a reference. The city of Dadeville, AL, near Lake Martin, has a latitude of about 32.83°N.

I think I have it.

To avoid confusion, let's think relatively.

Texas and Alabama share a similar latitude range, but Dallas is in North Texas, which might be higher latitude than some parts of Alabama.

Alabama is farther east, but latitude is north-south.
