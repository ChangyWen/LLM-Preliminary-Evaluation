*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Alfonso of Molina was born earlier than Yao Shu. To do that, I must find out their birth years.

Starting with Alfonso of Molina. I believe he was a historical figure, possibly related to Spanish royalty. Alfonso of Molina might be Alfonso, Lord of Molina. I think he was the son of King Alfonso IX of León. Let me recall: Alfonso IX had several children, including Ferdinand III who became king. Alfonso of Molina was indeed a son of Alfonso IX and brother to Ferdinand III.

I need his birth year. From what I remember, Alfonso of Molina was born around 1202. Let me confirm that. Alfonso IX was born in 1171, and he married Berengaria of Castile in 1197. Their first child was Ferdinand III, born in 1199 or 1201. Alfonso of Molina was a younger son. I think he was born in 1202. But I should double-check.

Upon second thought, Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202. Yes, that seems right. He died in 1272, and he was quite old, so born around 1202.

Now, Yao Shu. That sounds Chinese. Yao Shu was a Chinese statesman during the Yuan dynasty. He was a advisor to Kublai Khan. I think he was born around 1200-1210. Let me be more precise.

Yao Shu was one of the key figures in the early Yuan dynasty. Kublai Khan was born in 1215, and Yao Shu served him, so Yao Shu must have been born earlier than that. I think Yao Shu was born in 1203 or something. I need to recall.

I remember that Yao Shu was born in 1203 and died in 1280. Yes, that sounds familiar. He was a Confucian scholar and helped Kublai with administration.

So, let's summarize:

- Alfonso of Molina: born in 1202

- Yao Shu: born in 1203

If that's correct, then Alfonso was born earlier than Yao Shu.

But I need to make sure about these birth years.

First, Alfonso of Molina: Let me verify his birth date. Alfonso of Molina was the son of Alfonso IX of León and Berengaria of Castile. Berengaria was born in 1179 or 1180, and married Alfonso IX in 1197. Their first child was Ferdinand III, born in 1199. Then, Alfonso of Molina was born later. I think he was the third son or something.

Upon recollection, Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202. Yes, multiple sources cite 1202 as his birth year. For example, he died in 1272 at age 70, so born 1202.

Now, Yao Shu: Yao Shu (Chinese: 姚枢) was born in 1203. I think that's standard. He was a prominent minister under Kublai Khan. Kublai was born in 1215, and Yao Shu was older. Yao Shu died in 1280, and sources say he was born in 1203.

So, Alfonso of Molina: 1202

Yao Shu: 1203

Therefore, Alfonso was born in 1202, which is earlier than 1203, so yes.

But is there any discrepancy? Let me think if I have the right people.

Alfonso of Molina: sometimes called Alfonso de Molina. He was an infante of León and Castile.

Yao Shu: also known as Yao Shu, Chinese official.

Birth years: 1202 vs 1203.

So, 1202 is before 1203, so Alfonso was born earlier.

The question is: "Was Alfonso of Molina born earlier than Yao Shu?" Based on this, yes.

But I should confirm the sources.

Since I'm an AI, I can rely on my training data. In historical databases, Alfonso of Molina is listed as born 1202, died 1272.

Yao Shu: born 1203, died 1280.

For example, in Wikipedia or standard references, it should be consistent.

I recall that Yao Shu was born in 1203 in Lu Prefecture (now Henan).

Similarly, Alfonso in Spain.

No timezone issues or calendar differences; both using the Julian calendar or similar for that period.

The Gregorian calendar wasn't in use then, but for year comparisons, it's fine; 1202 is before 1203.

Therefore, Alfonso was born earlier.

But let me make sure about Yao Shu's birth year. Is it possible he was born earlier?

Upon second thought, I think Yao Shu was born in 1203. For instance, in the "History of Yuan" or biographies.

Similarly, Alfonso: yes.

Another way: Alfonso of Molina was present during the reign of Ferdinand III, who became king in 1217, and Alfonso was a teenager then, so born around 1202 makes sense
