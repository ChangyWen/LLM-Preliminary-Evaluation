*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church in Nevada is east of Pine Flat Dam in California. I should start by locating both places on a map.

St. Mary’s in the Mountains is in Virginia City, Nevada. I know that Virginia City is in the western part of Nevada, near Reno.

Pine Flat Dam is in California. I believe it's in the Sierra Nevada mountains, near Fresno. Pine Flat Dam is on the Kings River, and it's east of Fresno, but I need to be precise.

Now, to figure out the relative positions: is Virginia City, NV east of Pine Flat Dam, CA?

Let me recall some geography. Virginia City is in Storey County, Nevada. It's about 20-30 miles southeast of Reno. Reno itself is near the California-Nevada border, west-central Nevada.

Pine Flat Dam is in Fresno County, California. It's in the Sierra Nevada, roughly east of Fresno.

I should look at the longitudes because that will tell me east-west positioning.

First, find the longitude of Virginia City, NV.

Virginia City, NV coordinates: approximately 39.3093° N, 119.6492° W.

Longitude is 119.6492° W. That means it's west of the Prime Meridian.

Now, Pine Flat Dam, CA: I think it's around 36.8333° N, 119.3167° W or something close. Let me confirm.

Pine Flat Dam coordinates: approximately 36.8653° N, 119.3278° W. I found this online, but since I'm reasoning, I'll use approximate values.

So, Pine Flat Dam: longitude about 119.33° W.

Virginia City: longitude about 119.65° W.

Comparing longitudes: a more negative longitude means further west if we're in the western hemisphere.

Longitudes west are negative when using decimal degrees in some systems, but in standard notation, west longitudes are positive in some contexts, but numerically, higher west longitude means further west.

In decimal degrees, west longitudes are often expressed as negative, but in this case, both are west, so we can compare the numbers directly.

Both are west of Greenwich, so larger numerical value in degrees west means further west.

- Longitude of Virginia City: 119.6492° W

- Longitude of Pine Flat Dam: approximately 119.3278° W

Now, 119.6492 is greater than 119.3278, meaning Virginia City has a higher west longitude, so it is further west.

Let me think: the Prime Meridian is 0°, and as you go west, longitude increases up to 180°W. So, a larger number in degrees west means further west.

For example, 120°W is further west than 110°W.

So here, 119.6492°W vs. 119.3278°W.

Since 119.6492 > 119.3278, Virginia City is further west than Pine Flat Dam.

Therefore, Pine Flat Dam is east of Virginia City.

But the question is: is St. Mary’s east of Pine Flat Dam?

St. Mary’s is in Virginia City, so if Virginia City is west of Pine Flat Dam, then St. Mary’s is west of Pine Flat Dam, not east.

Let me double-check.

Pine Flat Dam longitude: 119.3278°W

Virginia City longitude: 119.6492°W

Difference: 119.6492 - 119.3278 = 0.3214 degrees.

Since longitude degrees are about 69 miles per degree at the equator, but since we're around 36-39°N, the distance per degree longitude is less because lines converge.

But approximately, each degree of longitude is about 53 miles at 40°N latitude.

I can calculate the difference.

First, the longitudinal difference: |119.6492 - 119.3278| = 0.3214 degrees.

Now, to find the distance, I need the average latitude.

Virginia City is at 39.3°N, Pine Flat Dam at 36.8°N, so average latitude about 38°N.

At 38°N, one degree of longitude is approximately: cos(38°) * 69.172 miles.

cos(38°) ≈ 0.7880

69.172 * 0.7880 ≈ 54.48 miles per degree.

So, longitudinal distance: 0.3214 degrees * 54.48 miles/degree ≈ 17.5 miles.

Now, since Virginia City has a higher west longitude (119.65°W vs 119.33°W), it is about 17.5 miles west of Pine Flat Dam.

Therefore, Virginia City is west of Pine Flat Dam.

So,
