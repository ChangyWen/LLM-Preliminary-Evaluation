*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Lake Vico located west of Pragser Wildsee?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I should recall where these lakes are located. Pragser Wildsee is in Italy, I think. It's also known as Lake Prags or Pragser Lake, and it's in the Dolomites in South Tyrol, Italy. Lake Vico—I'm not sure about that one. I think Lake Vico might be in Italy as well, perhaps in the Lazio region.

Let me confirm the locations:

- Pragser Wildsee: This is in northern Italy, in the province of South Tyrol. It's part of the Dolomites, which are in the eastern Alps. So, geographically, it's in the north of Italy.

- Lake Vico: I believe this is Lago di Vico in Italian. It's a volcanic lake in the Lazio region of central Italy. Lazio is where Rome is, so it's more towards the center of the country.

Now, I need to figure out their relative positions: is Lake Vico west of Pragser Wildsee?

First, let's think about the longitude. Pragser Wildsee is in the Dolomites, which are in the northeast of Italy. South Tyrol is quite far north and east.

Lake Vico is in Lazio, which is west-central Italy. Rome, for example, is around 12.5 degrees East longitude.

I should look up approximate coordinates, but since I'm an AI, I can access general knowledge.

Pragser Wildsee (Lake Prags) is near Bruneck or Braies in South Tyrol. The coordinates are approximately 46.7°N, 12.1°E.

Lake Vico (Lago di Vico) is in the province of Viterbo, Lazio. Coordinates roughly 42.3°N, 12.2°E.

Let me double-check that.

For Pragser Wildsee: I think it's at about 46°41'N, 12°05'E. Yes, around there.

For Lake Vico: I recall it's near Rome, and Rome is at 41.9°N, 12.5°E. Lake Vico is a bit north of Rome, so maybe 42.3°N, 12.2°E or something similar.

Upon second thought, Lake Vico might be around 42.3°N, 12.1°E. I need to be precise.

Actually, I should reason based on general geography.

Italy is oriented northwest to southeast, but the main part is north-south.

Northern Italy is more east, central Italy is west relative to the northeast.

Pragser Wildsee is in South Tyrol, which is the northernmost part of Italy, bordering Austria. So it's at high latitude and relatively east longitude.

Lake Vico is in Lazio, which is south of Tuscany, around 100-200 km north of Rome. Rome is at about 12.5°E, and since Lake Vico is north of Rome, it might be slightly less east, but longitude decreases as you go west.

Longitude: as you go west, longitude decreases if we're using east longitude.

Italy uses east longitude, from about 6°E to 18°E or so.

Pragser Wildsee: approximately 12.1°E

Lake Vico: let's say approximately 12.2°E? That can't be right because if both are around 12.1-12.2, they might be similar.

I think I have a mistake.

Pragser Wildsee is in the Dolomites, which are east of the main Alpine chain. For example, Bolzano, which is near, is at 11.4°E, but Pragser Wildsee is further east.

Pragser Wildsee is in the Val Pusteria, which is east. Braies is at about 12.08°E, 46.72°N.

Now, Lake Vico: Lago di Vico is in the Cimini Hills, Viterbo province. Viterbo city is at about 12.1°E, 42.4°N. Lake Vico is nearby, so probably around 12.2°E? I think it's more like 12.1°E.

Let me think differently. Rome is at 12.48°E, and Lake Vico is about 50 km north of Rome, so it should be a bit less east. Since longitude decreases as you go west, but north-south doesn't change longitude much in Italy.

Italy is not perfectly north-south; it's tilted.

But roughly, from Rome at 12.48°E, moving north to Viterbo, which is at 12.10°E or something. Viter
