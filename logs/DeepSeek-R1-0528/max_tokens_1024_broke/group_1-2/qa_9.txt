*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: Did William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey die later than Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy? I need to find out the death years of both individuals and compare them.

I should recall who these people are. William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, was a Norman nobleman who lived around the time of the Norman Conquest of England. Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy, sounds like she might be from the Aquitaine region and married into the Savoy family.

Let me start with William de Warenne. I think he died in 1088. I remember that he fought in the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and was later created Earl of Surrey. He was loyal to William the Conqueror. After William I died, there was some conflict during the reign of William II, and William de Warenne was involved in a rebellion. I think he died in 1088, possibly at the siege of Pevensey Castle or something similar. Yes, historical records indicate he died in 1088.

Now, for Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy. I need to clarify who she is. I think Agnes of Aquitaine might also be known as Agnes of Poitou or something similar? I recall that there was an Agnes who was the daughter of William V, Duke of Aquitaine, and she married into the Savoy family.

Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy—I believe she was the wife of Peter I, Count of Savoy. Peter I was Count of Savoy from about 1048 to 1078. Agnes was his wife. I need her death year.

I think Agnes of Aquitaine died in 1068. Let me think. She was born around 1025 or so, and she died relatively young. I recall that Agnes of Aquitaine, daughter of William V, Duke of Aquitaine, married Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor? No, that might be a different Agnes.

I think I'm confusing her with Agnes of Poitou, who was the mother of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. But the question says Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy.

Perhaps it's Agnes, daughter of William VII, Duke of Aquitaine? I need to get this straight.

Let me search my knowledge: Agnes of Aquitaine who was Countess of Savoy. I believe she was married to Peter I of Savoy. Peter I died in 1078, and Agnes survived him. But when did she die?

I found a reference in my mind: Agnes of Aquitaine died in 1077 or 1078? No, I think it was earlier.

Perhaps it's better to think historically. William de Warenne died in 1088.

For Agnes: I recall that Agnes of Aquitaine, wife of Peter I, Count of Savoy, died in 1068. I think that's right. She was born in 1020 or so, and died in 1068.

But let me confirm if this is the same person. The Countess of Savoy—Savoy was a county in that period.

Another way: I can think about the timeline. The Norman Conquest was in 1066. William de Warenne was active after that and died in 1088.

Agnes of Aquitaine: if she was Countess of Savoy, and Savoy was involved in European politics. Peter I of Savoy died in 1078, and Agnes was his widow. But when did she die?

I think Agnes of Aquitaine died in 1077. But I need a reliable source in my memory.

Perhaps I should consider that Agnes might be the same as Agnes of Poitou, but Poitou is part of Aquitaine, so it could be.

Agnes of Poitou was the regent for Henry IV, but that was in the Holy Roman Empire, not Savoy.

I think for Savoy, it's a different Agnes.

Let me clarify: Peter I, Count of Savoy, married Agnes of Aquitaine, daughter of William V, Duke of Aquitaine. William V died in 1030, so Agnes was born around 1000 or so? That seems too early.

William V of Aquitaine lived from about 969 to 1030. His children: Agnes married Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1043, and she died in 1077. But that Agnes was Empress, not Countess of Savoy.

The Countess of Savoy is different. Peter I of Savoy married Agnes of Aquitaine, who was the daughter of William VI or William VII? I'm getting confused.

I recall that Peter I of Savoy married Agnes, daughter of William V of Aquitaine. But William V had a daughter Agnes who
