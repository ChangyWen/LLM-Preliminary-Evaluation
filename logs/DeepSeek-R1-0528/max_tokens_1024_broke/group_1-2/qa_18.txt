We are comparing the longitude of Cattaraugus County, NY and Cambria County, PA.
 Generally, a location with a more negative (or less positive) longitude is further west in the United States.

 Step 1: Find the approximate longitude of Cattaraugus County, NY.
   - Cattaraugus County, NY is located in western New York.
   - The approximate longitude range for Cattaraugus County is around -78.0 to -79.0 degrees.

 Step 2: Find the approximate longitude of Cambria County, PA.
   - Cambria County, PA is located in west-central Pennsylvania.
   - The approximate longitude for Cambria County is around -78.5 to -79.0 degrees.

 However, let's get more specific:
   - The center of Cattaraugus County, NY is approximately at longitude -78.5 degrees (this is an average; the county spans from about -78.2 to -79.0).
   - The center of Cambria County, PA is approximately at longitude -78.7 degrees (with a range from about -78.4 to -79.0).

 But note: the western edge of Cambria County might be at about -78.8 degrees, and the eastern edge of Cattaraugus might be at about -78.2 degrees.

 However, we are comparing the general position. We can use the county seats:

   - Cattaraugus County seat: Little Valley, NY. Coordinates: approximately 42.2528° N, 78.8047° W.
   - Cambria County seat: Ebensburg, PA. Coordinates: approximately 40.4853° N, 78.7244° W.

 Step 3: Compare the longitudes:
   - Little Valley, NY (Cattaraugus): 78.8047° W (which is -78.8047)
   - Ebensburg, PA (Cambria): 78.7244° W (which is -78.7244)

 Since we are comparing westness, we look at the longitude values as negative numbers. The more negative the longitude, the further west.

   - Little Valley: -78.8047
   - Ebensburg: -78.7244

 Now, note that -78.8047 is more negative (i.e., less than) -78.7244. Therefore, Little Valley (Cattaraugus County, NY) is west of Ebensburg (Cambria County, PA).

 However, we must consider the entire counties. The westernmost point of Cambria County, PA is around -78.9 degrees (for example, the town of St. Michael, PA is at about 78.91° W). The easternmost point of Cattaraugus County is around -78.2 degrees (near the border with Wyoming County). But the westernmost point of Cattaraugus County is about -79.0 degrees (at the border with Chautauqua County and Pennsylvania).

 Therefore, the entire Cattaraugus County is not necessarily west of the entire Cambria County. However, the question is about the county as a whole being located west of the other county? Typically, we compare the average or the central point.

 Alternatively, we can look at the relative positions on the map:

   - Cambria County, PA is located at approximately 40.5°N, 78.7°W.
   - Cattaraugus County, NY is located at approximately 42.2°N, 78.8°W.

 But note that the longitude of Cattaraugus is more westward (78.8°W) than Cambria (78.7°W). However, wait: 78.8°W is the same as 78°48' and 78.7°W is 78°42'. So 78.8 is 0.1 degrees west of 78.7. Therefore, the central point of Cattaraugus is west of the central point of Cambria.

 However, note that the county seat of Cambria (Ebensburg) is at -78.7244, and the county seat of Cattaraugus (Little Valley) is at -78.8047. That means Little Valley is about 0.08 degrees west of Ebensburg.

 But let's check the entire county boundaries:

   - Cambria County, PA: 
        Eastern border: around -78.4° (near the border with Blair County)
        Western border: around -78.9° (at the border with Indiana County and Somerset County)

   - Cattaraugus County, NY:
        Eastern border: around -78.2° (near the border with Wyoming County and Allegany County)
        Western border: around -79.0° (at the border with Ch
