*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI located west of The Ort Institute, IL?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to know the locations of both places. Let me start with the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan. I know that Sheboygan is a city in Wisconsin. The University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is part of the University of Wisconsin system and it's located in Sheboygan, WI.

Now, what about The Ort Institute, IL? I'm not immediately familiar with "The Ort Institute." It might be a specific place in Illinois. Ort could be an acronym or a name. I recall that ORT is an organization, like World ORT, which is involved in education and training. But I'm not sure if there's a specific "Ort Institute" in Illinois.

Perhaps it's a misspelling or a reference to something else. Let me think: maybe it's the Art Institute of Chicago? That's famous, but the question says "The Ort Institute," not "Art." Ort with an 'O'. Could it be a typo for "Art"? But I should work with what's given.

Maybe "Ort" refers to a place. In Illinois, there's a city called North, but that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps it's O'Hare or something, but that's an airport. I need to clarify what "The Ort Institute" is.

Upon second thought, I believe "ORT" stands for "Organization for Rehabilitation through Training," and they have institutes in various places. But I need to find if there's one in Illinois specifically called "The Ort Institute."

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I should look for coordinates or general locations. But I don't have a map, so I'll rely on geographical knowledge.

Let me assume that "The Ort Institute" might refer to a well-known location. Perhaps it's in Chicago, as Illinois's largest city. But I need to be specific.

Another idea: maybe "Ort" is a typo for "Art," and it's the Art Institute of Chicago. That would make sense because it's a prominent institution. But the question says "Ort," so I should confirm.

Perhaps in the context, "The Ort Institute" is a specific place. Since I'm not sure, I'll proceed by looking up general locations.

But I'm an AI, so I can access knowledge. Let me recall: the Art Institute of Chicago is located in Chicago, IL. If "Ort" is a mistake, that might be it. But to be precise, I'll treat it as given.

Perhaps "Ort Institute" refers to ORT America or something, but I think their headquarters might be in New York or elsewhere. I need Illinois.

Let's search my knowledge: I believe there is an ORT technical institute in Skokie, Illinois. Skokie is a suburb of Chicago. I think that's likely what "The Ort Institute" refers to, as ORT has campuses, and one is in Skokie, IL.

Yes, World ORT has a presence, and there's an ORT Technical Institute in Skokie, IL. I'll go with that.

So, The Ort Institute, IL is in Skokie, IL, which is near Chicago.

Now, for University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan: it's in Sheboygan, WI.

I need to determine if Sheboygan, WI is west of Skokie, IL.

First, let's get the coordinates roughly.

Sheboygan, Wisconsin:

- Latitude: Approximately 43.75° N

- Longitude: Approximately 87.71° W

Longitude is measured in degrees west, so higher number means further west.

Skokie, Illinois:

- Latitude: Approximately 42.03° N

- Longitude: Approximately 87.74° W? Let me confirm.

Chicago is around 41.88° N, 87.63° W. Skokie is north of Chicago, so similar longitude.

Actual coordinates:

- Chicago, IL: about 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W

- Skokie, IL: about 42.0324° N, 87.7413° W

Yes.

Now Sheboygan, WI: about 43.7508° N, 87.7145° W

I have these from memory/knowledge.

Now, to compare west/east, we look at longitude. Longitude values are west, so a higher number means further west because it's more degrees west from the prime meridian.

For example, 87.74° W is further west than 87.63° W because 87.74 is a larger number, meaning more degrees west.

Similarly, 87.7145° W vs. 87.7413°
