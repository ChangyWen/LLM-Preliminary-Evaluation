*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan located south of WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I should clarify the locations. Both are in Manhattan, but I need to know where exactly they are to compare their positions.

HILLMAN HOUSES: I believe this is a public housing development in Manhattan. I think it's located on the Lower East Side. Let me confirm that. Yes, Hillman Houses is part of the NYCHA (New York City Housing Authority) and is situated on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

WILLIAMSBURG: Now, Williamsburg is a neighborhood, but it's in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which might be a mistake. Williamsburg is primarily in Brooklyn. However, there could be a reference to something else, but I doubt it. Let me double-check.

The question specifies "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which is confusing because Williamsburg is not in Manhattan. It might be a typo or misnomer. Perhaps it's referring to the Williamsburg Bridge or something, but it says "WILLIAMSBURG," which is a place.

In Manhattan, there is no neighborhood called Williamsburg; that's in Brooklyn. So, I think there might be an error in the question. But I should proceed based on what's given.

Perhaps it's a misspelling or confusion with another name. For example, there's Willets Point or something, but Williamsburg is definitely Brooklyn.

Another thought: sometimes people refer to areas near the bridge, but Williamsburg itself is Brooklyn.

Let me look at the geography. Manhattan is an island, and Brooklyn is across the East River. Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, northeast of Lower Manhattan.

Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, on the Lower East Side, which is in the southeastern part of Manhattan.

To determine if Hillman Houses is south of Williamsburg, I need to compare their latitudes since south means lower latitude.

First, let's establish the location of Hillman Houses. Hillman Houses is located at approximately 40.714°N latitude, on the Lower East Side, near the Manhattan Bridge and other landmarks.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is at approximately 40.714°N to 40.720°N latitude, depending on the exact spot. Williamsburg is a large area, but generally, it's around 40.712°N to 40.718°N.

I should use more precise coordinates.

Upon quick research in my knowledge:

- Hillman Houses: Address is 80 Pitt Street, New York, NY 10002. Latitude about 40.7147°N.

- Williamsburg, Brooklyn: Let's take a central point, say Bedford Avenue and North 7th Street, which is about 40.7172°N.

Comparing:

- Hillman Houses latitude: ~40.7147°N

- Williamsburg (Brooklyn) latitude: ~40.7172°N

Since 40.7147 is less than 40.7172, Hillman Houses has a lower latitude, meaning it is south of Williamsburg.

But Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which might imply that it's considering Williamsburg as part of Manhattan or something, but that's incorrect.

Perhaps there is a place called Williamsburg in Manhattan? I don't think so. Manhattan has neighborhoods like Financial District, Chinatown, Lower East Side, etc., but no Williamsburg.

Maybe it's a reference to the Williamsburg Bridge, which connects Manhattan and Brooklyn. The Manhattan end of the Williamsburg Bridge is on the Lower East Side.

The Williamsburg Bridge has an entrance in Manhattan near Delancey Street and Essex Street, which is very close to Hillman Houses.

Hillman Houses is at 80 Pitt Street, which is near Rutgers Street and East Broadway, so it's a bit south of Delancey.

Let's map it.

Lower East Side: Delancey Street is a major street. Williamsburg Bridge starts from Delancey Street in Manhattan.

Hillman Houses is south of Delancey Street. Pitt Street is between East Broadway and Canal Street, I think. Canal Street is south of Delancey.

Manhattan streets: Going north-south, Canal Street is at the bottom, then Division, then East Broadway, then Delancey Street, then Houston Street, etc.

Canal Street is roughly at the southern end of the Lower East Side. East Broadway is just north of Canal, and Delancey is north of that.

Hillman Houses is on Pitt Street between Grand Street and East Broadway, I believe. 80 Pitt Street is near East Broadway, which is south of Delancey Street.

Delancey Street is about at 40.718°N latitude, while
