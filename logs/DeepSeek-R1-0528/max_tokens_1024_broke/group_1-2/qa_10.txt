*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to compare the release dates of two songs: "Pull Me Under" by Dream Theater and "Jimmy James" by Beastie Boys. I should find out when each was released and see which one came first.

I recall that "Pull Me Under" is from Dream Theater's album "Images and Words." I think that album came out in 1992. Let me confirm that. Yes, "Images and Words" was released on July 7, 1992. And "Pull Me Under" was the lead single from that album, so it should have been released around the same time, probably a bit earlier or simultaneously. Singles are often released before the album to promote it. But for comparison, I should use the single release date if possible, or the album date if the single date isn't clear.

For "Jimmy James," it's by Beastie Boys from their album "Check Your Head." I think "Check Your Head" was released in 1992 as well. Let me think. Beastie Boys' "Check Your Head" came out on April 21, 1992. And "Jimmy James" is a track on that album. I'm not sure if it was released as a single separately.

I should look up the exact release dates to be accurate. Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll use the information I have or recall.

Let me list out what I know:

- Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under": From the album "Images and Words," released on July 7, 1992.

- Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James": From the album "Check Your Head," released on April 21, 1992.

Now, comparing the album release dates:

- "Check Your Head" – April 21, 1992

- "Images and Words" – July 7, 1992

So, April 21, 1992, is earlier than July 7, 1992. Therefore, "Jimmy James" was released earlier as part of the album.

But the question is about the songs themselves, not necessarily the albums. However, since both are tracks from their respective albums, and unless they were released as singles on different dates, the album release date is a good proxy.

Let me check if "Pull Me Under" was released as a single. I think it was. I believe "Pull Me Under" was released as a single in 1992, around the time of the album. Specifically, I think it was released in June 1992 or something. I need to be precise.

Upon second thought, I recall that "Pull Me Under" was released as a single on August 21, 1992. Is that right? Let me think. No, I think the album came out in July, and the single might have been released before or after.

Actually, I should use reliable sources in my mind. I remember that "Pull Me Under" was released as a single in 1992, and it gained popularity later, but the release date is key.

Similarly, for "Jimmy James," I don't think it was a single. "Jimmy James" is a song on "Check Your Head," but the singles from that album were "Pass the Mic," "So What'cha Want," and others. "Jimmy James" wasn't released as a single, I believe. So for "Jimmy James," the release date would be the album release date, April 21, 1992.

For "Pull Me Under," it was released as a single. Let me find the single release date.

I think "Pull Me Under" was released as a single on June 1, 1992. Is that accurate? I'm not sure. I might be confusing dates.

Perhaps I should consider both the album and single dates.

Let's assume that for songs not released as singles, we use the album release date. For songs released as singles, we might use the single release date if it's earlier.

But to be consistent, since the question is about the song release, it could be when it was first available, which is usually the album release unless a single precedes it.

In this case, for "Jimmy James," since it wasn't a single, it was first released on April 21, 1992, with the album.

For "Pull Me Under," if it was released as a single before the album, that would be earlier, but I don't think it was.

I recall that "Pull Me Under" was released as a single in August 1992. Let me think.

Upon recollection, Dream Theater's "Images and Words" album was released on July 7, 1992. The single "Pull Me Under" was released on August 21, 1992, in the US. I think that's right. But that would be after the album, which is unusual. Singles are often released before the album.

Perhaps it was released
