*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Newellton, LA located east of Garnavillo, IA?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to know the locations of both places. Newellton, LA is in Louisiana, and Garnavillo, IA is in Iowa. LA is the abbreviation for Louisiana, and IA for Iowa.

To determine if one is east of the other, I should look at their longitudes because longitude measures east-west position. The higher the longitude, the further west it is, assuming we're using the standard where negative values are west and positive are east, or vice versa. In the context of the US, we often think in terms of degrees west, but for comparison, I need the numerical longitudes.

I should recall or look up the approximate longitudes of these towns.

Let me start with Garnavillo, IA. Garnavillo is in Clayton County, Iowa. Iowa is in the Midwest, roughly between 90°W and 96°W longitude. I need to be more precise.

I think Dubuque, Iowa is around 90.7°W, and Des Moines is about 93.6°W. Garnavillo is in the eastern part of Iowa, near the Mississippi River. Let me find a better reference.

Since I don't have a map, I can use general knowledge. The Mississippi River runs north-south, and Iowa is west of the Mississippi. Garnavillo is right on the Mississippi River in eastern Iowa. I think it's near the border with Wisconsin or Illinois.

Garnavillo, IA: I believe it's at approximately 91.2°W longitude. Let me confirm that.

Similarly, Newellton, LA. Louisiana is in the South, and Newellton is in Tensas Parish, which is in northeastern Louisiana, near the Mississippi River as well. Newellton should be around 91.2°W or something? That might be close.

Let's think about the Mississippi River. The river flows south, so places along it might have similar longitudes, but there are bends.

I should look up the coordinates, but since this is a reasoning exercise, I might need to infer.

I recall that the longitude for Newellton, LA is approximately 91.24°W. And for Garnavillo, IA, I think it's around 91.12°W or something. Let me think.

Garnavillo, IA: I remember that Dubuque, IA is at about 90.7°W, and Garnavillo is east of Dubuque? No, Garnavillo is north of Dubuque or something.

Let's find the coordinates properly.

Since this is text-based, I can reason based on states.

Iowa is generally west of the Mississippi, and Louisiana is south, but both have parts along the river.

The Mississippi River is a good reference. Points along the river have varying longitudes.

For example, in Iowa, Davenport is around 90.6°W, and Dubuque is 90.7°W. Garnavillo is between them or near.

Garnavillo is in Clayton County, which is the far northeast corner of Iowa. I think Garnavillo is at approximately 91.1°W.

Upon second thought, let's assume I have access to data or recall.

I think Newellton, LA is at about 91.24°W, and Garnavillo, IA is at about 91.10°W. That would mean Garnavillo is slightly west of Newellton? Let's see.

Longitude: if Garnavillo is at 91.10°W and Newellton at 91.24°W, since both are west, a smaller number (less negative) means further east.

In decimal degrees, west longitudes are negative, but often we say 91°W meaning -91 degrees.

For comparison, a smaller numerical value in west longitude means it's further east because it's closer to the prime meridian.

For example, 90°W is east of 91°W.

So, if Garnavillo, IA has a longitude of, say, 91.10°W, and Newellton, LA has 91.24°W, then 91.10°W is east of 91.24°W because 91.10 is smaller than 91.24, so it's less west.

Numerically, -91.10 is greater than -91.24 (since -91.10 is to the right on a number line), but in terms of position, smaller magnitude west means further east.

Let's clarify:

- Longitude values: West longitudes are negative if we use the convention where prime meridian is 0, east is positive, west is negative.

But often in US, we use degrees west, which are positive numbers increasing west.
