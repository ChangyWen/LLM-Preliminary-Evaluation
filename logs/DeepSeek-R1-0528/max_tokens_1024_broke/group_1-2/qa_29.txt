*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Rara Lake located south of Medina Lake?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a yes or no answer.

I should recall where these lakes are located. I think Rara Lake is in Nepal, and Medina Lake is in the United States, specifically in Texas. But I need to confirm that.

Rara Lake: I believe it's the largest lake in Nepal, situated in the Rara National Park in the northwest part of Nepal.

Medina Lake: I think this is a reservoir in Texas, USA, near San Antonio.

Since the lakes are in different countries, I need to think about their geographic coordinates to determine if one is south of the other.

Let me get the approximate latitudes.

First, Rara Lake, Nepal:

- Nepal is in South Asia. The latitude of Rara Lake is around 29.5°N. I should look for more precise info.

Actually, I remember that Rara Lake is at about 29.52°N latitude. Let me confirm that.

Similarly, Medina Lake, Texas:

- Texas is in the southern United States. Medina Lake is near San Antonio. San Antonio is around 29.4°N latitude. Medina Lake should be similar.

San Antonio's latitude is approximately 29.42°N. Medina Lake is a bit west of San Antonio, but latitude should be close.

So, let's compare:

- Rara Lake, Nepal: approximately 29.52°N

- Medina Lake, Texas: approximately 29.42°N

Now, latitude measures north-south position. A lower latitude number means further south.

So, 29.42°N is south of 29.52°N because 29.42 is less than 29.52.

Therefore, Medina Lake is south of Rara Lake? No, the question is whether Rara Lake is south of Medina Lake.

Let's clarify:

If Medina Lake is at 29.42°N and Rara Lake is at 29.52°N, then Rara Lake is north of Medina Lake, not south.

Latitude decreases as you go south.

So:

- Higher latitude: further north

- Lower latitude: further south

Rara Lake: 29.52°N

Medina Lake: 29.42°N

Since 29.52 > 29.42, Rara Lake has a higher latitude, so it is north of Medina Lake.

Therefore, Rara Lake is not south of Medina Lake; it's north.

The question is: "Is Rara Lake located south of Medina Lake?"

Based on coordinates, no.

But let me double-check the coordinates to be sure.

I should verify the exact locations.

First, Rara Lake:

- Country: Nepal

- District: Mugu

- Coordinates: Approximately 29.52°N, 82.08°E

I think that's right.

Now, Medina Lake:

- It's in Texas, USA.

- Specifically, Medina County, Texas.

- Coordinates: I think it's around 29.53°N? No, that can't be right if San Antonio is 29.42°N.

San Antonio is at 29.42°N, but Medina Lake is northwest of San Antonio.

Let me think. Bandera is near Medina Lake, and Bandera, TX is at about 29.73°N? I need to look it up, but since I'm an AI, I can recall general knowledge.

Medina Lake is formed by Medina Dam, and it's in Medina County.

The coordinates for Medina Lake, Texas: approximately 29.55°N, 98.93°W? I think I have a mistake.

Let me correct.

San Antonio, TX: Latitude 29.4241°N

Medina Lake is about 30 miles northwest of San Antonio.

Northwest means higher latitude and more west.

So, latitude should be higher than San Antonio.

For example, Bandera, TX, which is near Medina Lake, is at 29.7267°N.

Bandera is at 29.72°N approximately.

Medina Lake itself: I think the dam or the lake center is around 29.55°N to 29.60°N.

Let me assume 29.58°N for simplicity.

But earlier I said Rara Lake is 29.52°N, so if Medina is 29.58°N, then Medina is north.

I need accurate values.

I recall that Rara Lake is at 29.5167°N.

And Medina Lake: let's say the coordinates are 29.6333°N, 98.9500°W or something.

Upon second thought, I think I might be confusing.

Let me think differently.

The key point is that Nepal is in the Northern Hemisphere, and Texas is also in the Northern Hemisphere, but at similar latitudes.

Rara Lake is in the
