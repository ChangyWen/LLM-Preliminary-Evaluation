*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Clackamas County, Oregon, is north of Yamhill County, Oregon. I should recall or look up the geographical locations of these counties.

I know that Oregon is a state in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It has multiple counties, and I need to compare Clackamas and Yamhill specifically.

Let me think about where these counties are. I remember that Portland is in Multnomah County, which is in the northern part of Oregon. Clackamas County is southeast of Portland, I think. Yamhill County is west of Portland, towards the coast.

I should visualize a map of Oregon. The Willamette Valley runs through western Oregon, and many counties are located there. Portland is at the northern end, with Washington County to the west, Multnomah containing Portland, Clackamas to the southeast, and then Yamhill might be southwest or something.

I think Yamhill County is to the southwest of Portland. Cities like McMinnville are in Yamhill County, which is in the Willamette Valley.

Clackamas County includes cities like Oregon City, which is south of Portland, and it extends towards Mount Hood.

Now, to compare their latitudes: which one is farther north?

I can think in terms of major cities or reference points.

For example, Portland is roughly at 45.5 degrees north latitude. But let's be more specific.

I might need actual coordinates or a relative position.

Since I can't look it up, I'll rely on general knowledge.

I recall that Yamhill County is west of the Willamette River and includes areas like Newberg and McMinnville. Clackamas County is east of the Willamette River in parts, but it's more southeastern from Portland.

Portland is in Multnomah County. Directly south of Multnomah is Clackamas County. So Clackamas is south of Portland.

West of Multnomah is Washington County, and southwest of that is Yamhill County. So Yamhill is west and a bit south of Portland.

But is Yamhill north or south of Clackamas?

Let's think about the counties bordering them.

Multnomah County has Portland. South of Multnomah is Clackamas County. West of Multnomah is Washington County, and south of Washington County is Yamhill County. Also, Yamhill County is south of Washington County and west of Clackamas County? Not directly west, I think.

The counties: starting from the north, along the Columbia River, you have Clatsop, then Multnomah, etc.

But for the Willamette Valley, from north to south: Multnomah County, then south of that, Clackamas County is to the southeast, but actually, directly south of Multnomah is Clackamas for the eastern part, but there's also Washington County to the west.

Perhaps I should list the counties in order.

I remember that Yamhill County is south of Washington County and north of Polk County. Washington County is directly west of Portland, so cities like Beaverton and Hillsboro.

South of Washington County is Yamhill County, with cities like McMinnville.

East of Washington County is Multnomah, and southeast is Clackamas.

Clackamas County is not directly south of Multnomah; it's more that Multnomah is north, Clackamas is east and south, but the southern part of the metro area.

Perhaps I can think of latitude lines.

I think Portland is around 45.5°N. Oregon City, which is in Clackamas County, is about 45.4°N, so slightly south of Portland.

McMinnville, in Yamhill County, is about 45.2°N, I think. Is that right?

Let me estimate.

I know that Salem, the capital, is south of both and is about 44.9°N. Portland is 45.5°N, Salem is 44.9°N, so about 0.6 degrees south.

Yamhill County is between Portland and Salem. McMinnville is roughly halfway, so maybe 45.3°N or something.

But let's be more precise if possible.

I can consider the county seats.

The county seat of Clackamas County is Oregon City. The county seat of Yamhill County is McMinnville.

Oregon City latitude: I believe it's approximately 45.36°N.

McMinnville latitude: I think it's around 45.21°N.

If that's the case, then Oregon City is at a higher latitude than McMinnville, meaning Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County.

But let me confirm if I have these latitudes correct.

I should think relatively.

From Portland, going south on I-5, you enter Clackamas County, but actually, I-5 goes through Multnomah, then into Clackamas briefly before entering Marion County? No.
