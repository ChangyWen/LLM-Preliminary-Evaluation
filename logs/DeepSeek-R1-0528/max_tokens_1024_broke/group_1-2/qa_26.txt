*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: Is 97233, OR located west of 98580, WA? I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that 97233 is a ZIP code for Portland, Oregon, and 98580 is a ZIP code for Shelton, Washington. But I should confirm that.

ZIP codes: 97233 is indeed in Portland, OR. And 98580 is in Shelton, WA. I can think about their geographical locations.

Oregon and Washington are both on the west coast of the United States. Portland is in the northwest part of Oregon, and Shelton is in Washington, west of Seattle.

I need to compare their longitudes because longitude determines east-west position. West has more negative longitude if we're using the decimal degrees system, where negative values are west of the Prime Meridian.

In the context of the US, since both are in the western hemisphere, longitudes are negative. But for comparison, a more negative longitude means further west.

For example, the longitude of Portland, OR: I think it's around -122.67 degrees. And for Shelton, WA, I need to find that.

Since I don't have a map, I should recall or estimate based on cities.

Portland, Oregon is on the west side of Oregon, near the Columbia River. Shelton, Washington is on the Olympic Peninsula, which is west of Seattle.

The Olympic Peninsula is quite far west. In fact, it might be further west than Portland.

Let me think about the coastline. The Pacific Ocean is to the west. Portland is inland a bit, along the Willamette River. Shelton is on the Puget Sound, but the Olympic Peninsula extends further west.

Specifically, Shelton is in Mason County, Washington, and it's on the west side of the Puget Sound. But the westernmost point in Washington is Cape Flattery, which is on the Olympic Peninsula.

But Shelton itself isn't on the coast; it's on the inland waterway. Still, compared to Portland, it might be further west.

I should look up the coordinates, but since this is a reasoning exercise, I need to do it without external sources.

I can think about the relative positions. Seattle is at approximately 47.6°N, 122.3°W. Portland is at about 45.5°N, 122.6°W. Let me recall.

Standard coordinates:

- Portland, OR: Latitude 45.5231° N, Longitude 122.6765° W

- For Shelton, WA: I think it's around 47.2°N, 123.1°W or something. I need to be accurate.

Longitude for Portland is about 122.68° W.

Now, Shelton, WA: I believe it's further west. Let me think.

Olympia, the capital of Washington, is near Shelton. Olympia is at about 47.0379° N, 122.9007° W.

Shelton is west of Olympia. Yes, Shelton is west of Olympia.

Olympia longitude is approximately 122.90° W.

Portland is 122.68° W.

122.68 vs 122.90. Since longitude is measured west, a larger number means further west.

In decimal degrees, for west longitude, higher numerical value means further west. Because it's degrees west from Greenwich.

So, 122.90° W is further west than 122.68° W.

Therefore, Shelton has a higher longitude value (in magnitude) than Portland.

Longitude: Portland ~122.68° W, Shelton ~123.10° W? I need to be sure.

Let me confirm Shelton's coordinates.

Upon recollection, Shelton, WA ZIP code 98580: Latitude 47.2131° N, Longitude 123.1007° W.

I think that's about right. For comparison:

- Portland: Longitude ~122.6765° W

- Shelton: Longitude ~123.1007° W

Now, 123.1007 is greater than 122.6765, meaning Shelton is further west.

Since both are west, higher longitude value means further west.

Therefore, Shelton, WA is west of Portland, OR.

But the question is: Is 97233 (Portland, OR) west of 98580 (Shelton, WA)?

If Shelton is west of Portland, then Portland is east of Shelton, so Portland is not west of Shelton.

Let's clarify.

If point A is west of point B, then point B is east of point A.

Here, we have point A: Portland, OR (97233)

Point B: Shelton, WA (98580)

From the longitudes:

Longitude of A (Portland): 122.6765° W

Longitude of
