*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO located east of Sangre de Cristo Range, CO?"

This seems confusing because both names sound very similar. I need to figure out if they refer to the same thing or different things.

I know that the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are a mountain range in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. They're part of the Rocky Mountains.

But the question mentions "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" and "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO". The range part might be a subset or perhaps it's the same thing.

In geographical terms, "mountains" and "range" can sometimes be used interchangeably, but here it's specified separately.

I should look up what the Sangre de Cristo Range is. Maybe it's a specific part of the larger Sangre de Cristo Mountains.

Upon second thought, I recall that the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are often referred to as the Sangre de Cristo Range. In fact, I think "Sangre de Cristo Range" is just another name for the same mountain system.

But the question is asking if one is east of the other, which implies they are distinct entities.

Perhaps there's a mistake in the question. Let me read it carefully: "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" and "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO". Both are in Colorado, I assume.

Sangre de Cristo Mountains span Colorado and New Mexico, but the question specifies CO for both, so we're focusing on the Colorado part.

Now, is there a separate feature called Sangre de Cristo Range within Colorado?

I think I need to consult a map or geographical database.

Since I'm an AI, I can access my knowledge base.

The Sangre de Cristo Mountains are a major range, and they are sometimes divided into subranges. For example, in Colorado, the Sangre de Cristo Range might refer to the northern part or something.

But typically, "Sangre de Cristo Range" isn't a standard separate name; it's synonymous with the mountains.

Perhaps the question has a typo. It says "Sangre de Cristo Range" but it might be meant to be something else.

Another idea: In some contexts, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are divided into the Sangre de Cristo Range and another part, but I don't recall that.

Let me think about the geography. The Sangre de Cristo Mountains run north-south along the east side of the Rio Grande Rift. In Colorado, they include peaks like Blanca Peak, Crestone Peak, etc.

But is there a feature called "Sangre de Cristo Range" that is distinct?

Perhaps the "range" refers to a smaller segment.

I found online that sometimes the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are considered a range, and there might not be a separate entity.

But let's consider the wording: "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" vs. "Sangre de Cristo Range". In many sources, these are used interchangeably.

For example, the USGS and other authorities list "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" as the official name, and "range" is a general term.

However, to answer the question, I need to see if they are distinct.

Perhaps in Colorado, there is a specific Sangre de Cristo Range that is part of the larger mountains.

I recall that the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are divided into several subranges, but I'm not sure about a "Sangre de Cristo Range" as a subrange.

Let's list the subranges. In Colorado, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains include:

- The Sangre de Cristo Range proper, which might be the main spine.

But that's circular.

Perhaps the northern part is called one thing and the southern part another.

For instance, the Culebra Range is a subrange of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Colorado.

The Culebra Range is the southern part, near the New Mexico border.

And the northern part might just be called the Sangre de Cristo Range.

But I think it's all under the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.

Let me clarify: The Sangre de Cristo Mountains are a mountain range, and within them, there are subranges like the Culebra Range, Crestones, etc., but "Sangre de Cristo Range" isn't typically a subrange name; it's the name for the whole range.

For example, from Wikipedia: "The Sangre de Cristo Mountains are a mountain range in the Rocky Mountains in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico."

It says "mountain range", so range is part of the name.

The question has "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" and "Sangre de Cristo Range", which might be the same thing.

But the question is asking if one is east of the other, which would only make sense if they are different.

Perhaps "Sangre de Cristo Range" refers to something else.

Another thought: There is a Sangre de Cristo
