*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: Did William II, Count of Chalon live longer than Anastasia of Sirmium? I need to figure out their lifespans and compare them.

I should recall who these people are. William II, Count of Chalon, was a historical figure from the Chalon family in France. Anastasia of Sirmium is likely Saint Anastasia, a Christian martyr from the Roman era.

Let me start with Anastasia of Sirmium. She is a saint, and her feast day is December 25th, but I think she was martyred. I believe she died during the Diocletian persecution, around 304 AD. Sirmium was in Pannonia, which is modern-day Serbia. Yes, Saint Anastasia was martyred in the early 4th century, specifically in 304 AD.

Now, William II, Count of Chalon. I need to identify which William II this is. There were multiple Counts of Chalon. Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne is in Burgundy, France. I think William II was from the 10th or 11th century. Let me think.

I recall that William I of Chalon was around in the 10th century, and William II might be his successor. Let me be more precise.

Upon thinking, William II, Count of Chalon, was also known as William of Chalon. He lived from around 1020 to 1080 or something. I need exact dates.

Perhaps I can think about the Chalon family. The County of Chalon was established, and William II was count in the 11th century.

I remember that William II, Count of Chalon, died in 1080. I think he was involved in conflicts with the church or something. Yes, he died in 1080.

But let me confirm Anastasia first. Saint Anastasia of Sirmium died in 304 AD, during the reign of Diocletian. That's well-established.

Now for William II. Let me see if I can find reliable dates. I think William II was born around 1020 and died in 1080. I recall that he was excommunicated and died in 1080.

Perhaps I can think about historical context. The First Crusade was in 1096, so William II was before that.

I found online or recall that William II, Count of Chalon, died in 1080. But I need to be careful.

Another William: there was William I, who died around 1039, and then William II took over. William II died in 1080.

Yes, that seems consistent.

So, Anastasia died in 304 AD.

William II died in 1080 AD.

Now, comparing the years: 304 AD is much earlier than 1080 AD. So, William II lived much later than Anastasia.

The question is: did William II live longer than Anastasia? That means, did he have a longer lifespan, or did he live to a later date?

The phrasing: "live longer than" could be ambiguous. It could mean lived for more years, or it could mean existed later in time.

In historical comparisons, "live longer than" usually refers to lifespan, not the time period.

Let me read the question: "Did William II, Count of Chalon live longer than Anastasia of Sirmium?"

In English, "live longer" typically means having a greater age at death, i.e., more years lived.

For example, "He lived longer than she did" means he had a longer life.

But in this context, it might be misinterpreted, but I think it's about lifespan.

However, looking at the dates, Anastasia died young; she was martyred, so probably in her 20s or 30s. William II was a count, so he likely lived to an older age.

But I need to confirm both.

First, Anastasia of Sirmium: she was a young woman when martyred. Historical accounts say she was martyred around 304 AD, and she is often depicted as young, so let's say she died in her 20s or 30s. I don't have an exact birth year, but she was born in the late 3rd century, died 304 AD.

William II: born around 1020, died 1080, so he lived about 60 years.

But for Anastasia, without a birth date, I can only assume she died young.

Perhaps the question is simply about who died later, but that doesn't make sense with "live longer."

Let me think differently.

In historical terms, when comparing two figures from different eras, "live longer" might be misinterpreted, but I think it's about lifespan.

But to be thorough, let's see both interpretations.

First interpretation: did William II have a longer lifespan than Anastasia?

Anastasia: martyred in 304 AD, likely young, say
