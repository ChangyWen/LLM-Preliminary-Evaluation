*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is 35473, AL less populous than 76234, TX?" I need to figure out if the ZIP code 35473 in Alabama has a smaller population than the ZIP code 76234 in Texas.

ZIP codes are used for mail delivery, and they can correspond to areas with different population sizes. To answer this, I need population data for these specific ZIP codes.

I don't have that data memorized, so I should recall that population data for ZIP codes can be found from sources like the U.S. Census Bureau or other demographic databases. Since this is a reasoning exercise, I might need to infer or recall general knowledge.

Perhaps the numbers 35473 and 76234 are not ZIP codes but something else? Let me read the question again: "35473, AL" and "76234, TX". AL is Alabama, TX is Texas, so these are likely ZIP codes. ZIP codes in the US are five-digit numbers, and they can be looked up.

But I don't have a database here. Maybe I can think about the areas these ZIP codes cover. For example, ZIP codes starting with 35 are in Alabama, and 76 in Texas. But that doesn't directly give population.

I should consider that population can vary widely. Urban ZIP codes tend to have higher populations than rural ones.

Let me try to recall or infer what areas these ZIP codes are for.

First, 35473: I think that might be for Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Tuscaloosa is home to the University of Alabama, so it might have a significant population.

35473 – I believe that covers parts of Tuscaloosa. Tuscaloosa has multiple ZIP codes, and 35473 might be one of them. I'm not entirely sure.

Similarly, 76234: Texas ZIP codes starting with 76 are in the north-central part, like around Denton or that area. 76234 – I think that's for Pilot Point, Texas, or something like that? I need to be precise.

Perhaps I can reason based on typical population sizes.

But that might not be accurate. Maybe the question is tricking me, and I need to notice something about the numbers.

Another thought: sometimes "populous" refers to the population, but here it's "less populous," meaning has fewer people.

Perhaps I can look for data. Since this is an AI response, I might have access to embedded knowledge or I can simulate a lookup.

I recall that for such questions, population estimates are available.

Let me try to remember: Tuscaloosa, AL has a population around 100,000, but that's the city, not the ZIP code. ZIP code populations are smaller.

For example, a typical urban ZIP code might have 20,000 to 50,000 people, while rural ones might have less than 5,000.

But I need specifics.

Perhaps I can think about the areas. 35473, AL: after a quick search in my mind, I think that's for Holt, Alabama, which is a smaller community near Tuscaloosa. Is that right?

I should confirm. 35473 is indeed for Holt, AL, which is a census-designated place with a smaller population.

Similarly, 76234: I think that's for Sanger, Texas. Sanger is a city in Denton County.

Sanger, TX has a population around 8,000 or so, but again, that's the city, not necessarily the ZIP code.

ZIP codes don't always align perfectly with city boundaries.

I need actual ZIP code population data.

Since this is a step-by-step reasoning, I can state that I need to look up the population.

But as an AI, I can access or recall approximate values.

Let me assume I have access to a database or common knowledge.

From what I remember:

- ZIP code 35473: Holt, Alabama. Population estimate around 3,500 to 4,000 people.

- ZIP code 76234: Sanger, Texas. Population estimate around 7,000 to 8,000 people.

But I'm not sure about these numbers. Let me think.

I can reason based on the state populations or something, but that won't help for specific ZIP codes.

Another idea: perhaps the numbers 35473 and 76234 are not ZIP codes but coordinates or something? But the question says "35473, AL" and "76234, TX", which is standard notation for ZIP code and state.

AL is Alabama, TX is Texas.

Perhaps it's a trick with the commas, but I think it's clear.

Maybe 35473 and 76234 are population figures, but that doesn't make sense because it says "less populous" and the states are given.

The question is: "Is 35473, AL less populous than 76234, TX?" so it's comparing the population of the area with ZIP 35473 in AL to
