*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Schiller International University in Florida is north of The University of Tampa in Florida. Both are in Florida, so I should look up their locations or addresses to find their latitudes, since north-south position is determined by latitude.

I recall that Schiller International University has a campus in Florida. I think it's in Largo, Florida. Let me confirm that. Upon a quick search in my knowledge, Schiller International University has a campus in Largo, FL. But I should be precise.

Actually, Schiller International University has multiple locations, but for Florida, I believe it's in Largo. And The University of Tampa is, as the name suggests, in Tampa, FL.

Now, I need to compare the latitudes of Largo and Tampa to see which is further north.

First, let's find the latitude of Tampa, FL. Tampa is a well-known city. I think Tampa's latitude is approximately 27.95° N or something like that. I should be more accurate.

I remember that Tampa is on the west coast of Florida, around 27.9° N latitude. Let me think of a reference point. For example, Orlando is around 28.5° N, and Miami is about 25.7° N. Tampa should be south of Orlando.

Tampa's coordinates: I think it's about 27.9478° N latitude.

Now, Largo, FL: Largo is in Pinellas County, which is part of the Tampa Bay area. In fact, Largo is just west of Tampa, but is it north or south?

Tampa is in Hillsborough County, and Largo is in Pinellas County. Pinellas County includes cities like St. Petersburg and Clearwater. Largo is north of St. Petersburg.

St. Petersburg is directly west of Tampa across the bay, and Largo is north of St. Pete.

But I need the actual latitude.

Let me approximate:

- Tampa, FL: approximately 27.95° N

- St. Petersburg, FL: approximately 27.77° N (I think St. Pete is a bit south of Tampa)

I should look this up properly.

I know that the latitude decreases as you go south. So higher latitude means more north.

Tampa Bay area: Tampa is on the east side of the bay, and St. Petersburg is on the west side. St. Petersburg is actually slightly south of Tampa.

For example:

- Downtown Tampa: about 27.95° N

- Downtown St. Petersburg: about 27.77° N

So St. Pete is south of Tampa.

Now, Largo, FL: Largo is north of St. Petersburg. In fact, Largo is around 27.91° N or something. I need the exact coordinates.

Since I don't have real-time access, I'll use general knowledge.

Pinellas County cities: Clearwater is north of Largo, and Clearwater is about 27.97° N, I think.

Let's think:

- Clearwater, FL: approximately 27.96° N

- Largo, FL: since it's between St. Pete and Clearwater, it should be around 27.86° N or something. I'm confusing myself.

I can look up the addresses.

Schiller International University's Florida campus: I believe it's at 5560 Lake Avenue, Largo, FL 33760.

The University of Tampa: 401 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33606.

Now, to find latitudes.

I know that in Florida, the latitude can be found using online tools, but since I'm an AI, I should recall or estimate.

Tampa's latitude: 27.9478° N

Largo's latitude: Let's find Largo, FL. Largo is a city in Pinellas County. The coordinates for Largo are approximately 27.9097° N.

Confirming:

- Tampa, FL: 27.9478° N

- Largo, FL: 27.9097° N (source: general knowledge or quick search)

So Tampa is at about 27.95° N, and Largo is at about 27.91° N. Therefore, Tampa has a higher latitude than Largo.

Higher latitude means further north.

So Tampa is north of Largo.

Therefore, Schiller International University in Largo is south of The University of Tampa in Tampa.

The question is: Is Schiller International University north of The University of Tampa?

Based on latitudes:

- University of Tampa: ~27.95° N

- Schiller in Largo: ~27.91° N

Since 27.91 < 27.95, Largo has a lower latitude, so it is south of Tampa.

Thus, Schiller is not north of University of Tampa; it is south.

But let me double-check the coordinates.

I should be more precise.
