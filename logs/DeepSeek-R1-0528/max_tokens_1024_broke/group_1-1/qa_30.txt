*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Pragser Wildsee located west of Lake Vico?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to know where these lakes are located. Pragser Wildsee sounds familiar; I think it's in Italy, possibly in the Dolomites. Lake Vico also rings a bell; I believe it's in Italy too, near Rome or something.

Let me confirm the locations:

- Pragser Wildsee: I think this is also known as Lake Prags or Lago di Braies in Italian. It's in South Tyrol, which is in northern Italy, in the Alps.

- Lake Vico: I believe this is Lago di Vico in Italian. It's in central Italy, in the Lazio region, northwest of Rome.

Now, to determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their longitudes. Since both are in Italy, which runs roughly north-south, I should look at the east-west positioning.

Italy is oriented from northwest to southeast. Northern Italy is more to the west compared to central and southern Italy because of the way the peninsula curves.

Let me think about the approximate coordinates:

- Pragser Wildsee (Lake Braies): I recall it's in the Trentino-Alto Adige region. Let's say around 46.7°N, 12.1°E or something like that. I should look for precise coordinates if possible, but since this is reasoning, I'll use general knowledge.

- Lake Vico: In Lazio, I think it's around 42.3°N, 12.2°E. I need to be careful.

I know that Rome is at about 41.9°N, 12.5°E. Lake Vico is north of Rome, so let's say approximately 42.3°N, 12.2°E. I can confirm that later.

Pragser Wildsee is in the far north, near the Austrian border. South Tyrol is east of Switzerland and north of Verona, for example.

Verona is around 45.4°N, 11.0°E. Pragser Wildsee is further east; I think it's in the Puster Valley, which is around 46.7°N, 12.1°E.

Similarly, Lake Vico: I think it's in the Cimini Hills, northwest of Rome. Rome is 41.9°N, 12.5°E, so Lake Vico, being north, might be around 42.3°N, 12.2°E. I think it's slightly west of Rome.

Upon second thought, Lake Vico is west of Rome. Rome is at 12.5°E, and Lake Vico is at about 12.2°E or less? Let me think.

I should use reliable geographical knowledge. Since I can't look it up, I'll reason with what I know.

Generally, northern Italy is more western than central Italy because the peninsula angles to the southeast.

For example, Milan is at about 9.2°E, which is west of Rome at 12.5°E. But Pragser Wildsee is not near Milan; it's in the east of northern Italy.

South Tyrol is one of the easternmost parts of northern Italy. It borders Austria, and Austria is east.

Let's compare longitudes:

- Pragser Wildsee: approximately 12.1°E

- Lake Vico: approximately 12.2°E

If both are around 12.1-12.2°E, they might be very close in longitude, but I need to see which one is west.

Is Lake Vico at 12.2°E or less?

I think Lake Vico is at a lower longitude, meaning more west.

Longitude: lower numbers are west, higher numbers are east, for locations east of Greenwich.

So, if a place has a smaller longitude number, it is further west.

Now, for Pragser Wildsee: I believe it's at about 12.1°E.

Lake Vico: I think it's around 12.2°E or 12.3°E? I'm confusing it.

Let's think about Rome. Rome is at 12.486°E, approximately 12.5°E.

Lake Vico is northwest of Rome, in the province of Viterbo. Viterbo city is at about 12.1°E, 42.4°N.

Lake Vico is close to Viterbo. I think Lake Vico is at approximately 12.2°E.

Pragser Wildsee: it's in the Dolomites, near Bruneck or something. Bruneck is at 11.9°E, 46.8°N, but Pragser Wildsee is a bit east of
