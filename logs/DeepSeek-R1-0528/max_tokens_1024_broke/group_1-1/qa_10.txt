*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Was Beastie Boys’s Jimmy James released earlier than Dream Theater’s Pull Me Under?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to recall the release dates for both songs. I should rely on my knowledge of music history.

Starting with Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James." I think this song is from their album "Check Your Head," which was released in 1992. "Jimmy James" is a track on that album. Let me confirm: yes, "Check Your Head" came out on April 21, 1992.

Now, for Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under." This is from their album "Images and Words," which I believe was released in 1992 as well. Specifically, "Pull Me Under" was a single, and the album came out on July 7, 1992.

Both in 1992? I need to be precise because the question is about which one was released earlier.

So, Beastie Boys: "Check Your Head" album release date is April 21, 1992. Therefore, "Jimmy James" was released on that date, as it's part of the album.

Dream Theater: "Images and Words" album release date is July 7, 1992. "Pull Me Under" is the lead single from that album. I think the single might have been released before the album.

I need to check the single release date for "Pull Me Under." Often, singles are released ahead of the album to promote it.

From my knowledge, "Pull Me Under" was released as a single in 1992. I think it was released before the album. Let me think: the album came out in July, so the single might have been out earlier.

Upon second thought, I recall that "Pull Me Under" was released as a single on August 21, 1992. Is that right? No, that might not be accurate.

I should think carefully. I can reason based on the album dates if single dates aren't available.

But the question is about the song release, which could be the single release or the album release. Typically, for such comparisons, we consider the first release date, whether single or album.

For "Jimmy James," it might not have been a single; it was just an album track. So its release date would be the album release date.

Similarly, for "Pull Me Under," it was released as a single, so we should consider the single release date if it's earlier.

Let me confirm the dates.

First, Beastie Boys' "Check Your Head": Released April 21, 1992. "Jimmy James" is track 2 on that album, so it was released on that date.

Now, Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under": The single was released in 1992. I think it was released in July 1992, around the same time as the album.

I remember that "Pull Me Under" became popular and was a hit, but I need the exact release date.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the year. Both 1992, but April is before July, so "Jimmy James" might be earlier.

But let's see about the single release.

Upon recollection, "Pull Me Under" was released as a single on May 29, 1992. Is that correct? I'm not sure.

I think I might be confusing it with something else.

Let me use logical reasoning based on common knowledge.

I know that Dream Theater's "Images and Words" was their breakthrough album in 1992. The single "Pull Me Under" was released to promote the album.

Typically, singles are released a few weeks before the album.

For example, if the album came out on July 7, 1992, the single might have been released in June or late May.

But I need to be precise.

I can think about the chart performances or other events.

But that might not help with exact dates.

Perhaps I should consider that since "Jimmy James" was not a single, its release is tied to the album, which is April 21, 1992.

For "Pull Me Under," as a single, it has a separate release date.

But what is that date?

I recall that "Pull Me Under" entered the Billboard charts in August 1992, but that's when it charted, not necessarily when it was released.

Release dates can be tricky.

Perhaps for simplicity, since both are from 1992, and April is before July, "Jimmy James" was released earlier.

But let's confirm if "Pull Me Under" was released as a single earlier.

After a quick mental search, I think "Pull Me Under" was released as a single on July 29, 1992. But that can't be right because the album was out on July 7, so the single would be before.
