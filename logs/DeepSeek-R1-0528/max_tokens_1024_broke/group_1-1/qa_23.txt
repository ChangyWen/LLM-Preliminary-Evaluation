*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Pine Flat Dam in California is east of St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church in Nevada. I should start by finding the locations of both places.

Let me recall what I know about Pine Flat Dam. I think it's in Fresno County, California, on the Kings River. It's a dam used for flood control, irrigation, and hydroelectric power. Now, for St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, I believe that's in Virginia City, Nevada. Virginia City is a historic town in Storey County, Nevada, known for its mining history.

I need the geographic coordinates to compare their longitudes, since "east" is determined by longitude. Places with higher longitude are further east, assuming we're using the standard coordinate system where longitude increases to the east.

So, step one: Find the latitude and longitude of Pine Flat Dam, CA.

From my knowledge, Pine Flat Dam is near Fresno, CA. Fresno is around 36.7°N, 119.8°W. But let's be precise. I think Pine Flat Dam is at approximately 36.833°N, 119.317°W. I should confirm that.

Upon second thought, I can use general geographic knowledge. California is west of Nevada, right? So, if Pine Flat Dam is in central California and St. Mary’s is in western Nevada, then Pine Flat Dam should be west of St. Mary’s, meaning it's not east—it's west.

But let's make sure about the locations.

St. Mary’s in the Mountains is in Virginia City, NV. Virginia City, NV is near Reno, NV. Reno is at about 39.5°N, 119.8°W. Virginia City is south of Reno, so similar longitude, roughly 39.3°N, 119.65°W or something like that. I need better coordinates.

Pine Flat Dam: Let me think. Kings River is in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno. Fresno is at 36.7378°N, 119.7871°W. Pine Flat Dam is northeast of Fresno, I think. Actually, it's about 35 miles east of Fresno, but still in California.

I found online that Pine Flat Dam coordinates are approximately 36.8314°N, 119.3183°W. (I'm recalling from memory or general knowledge.)

Similarly, for St. Mary’s in the Mountains, Virginia City, NV: Virginia City is at about 39.3096°N, 119.6497°W.

Now, to compare longitudes:

Pine Flat Dam longitude: 119.3183°W

St. Mary’s longitude: 119.6497°W

Since both are in the western hemisphere, longitude is measured west from Greenwich. So, a smaller numerical value of west longitude means it's further east because it's less west.

For example, 119.3183°W is closer to the Prime Meridian than 119.6497°W, meaning 119.3183°W is east of 119.6497°W.

Let's think carefully.

Longitude decreases as you go east. So, a lower number in west longitude means more east.

-119.3183 is greater than -119.6497 if we think in terms of decimal degrees, but since it's west, we use negative for west in some systems.

In standard decimal degrees, west longitudes are negative.

So, let's convert:

Pine Flat Dam: 119.3183°W = -119.3183

St. Mary’s: 119.6497°W = -119.6497

Now, numerically, -119.3183 is greater than -119.6497 because -119.3183 is closer to zero.

In terms of eastness, a higher numerical value (less negative) means further east.

So, -119.3183 vs. -119.6497

-119.3183 > -119.6497, so Pine Flat Dam has a higher longitude value, meaning it is east of St. Mary’s.

But that can't be right because California is west of Nevada.

I think I have a mistake.

Let me plot this mentally.

Reno, NV is at about 119.8°W, and Virginia City is similar. Fresno, CA is at 119.8°W, but Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno, so its longitude should be less west, meaning smaller number.

Fresno is at 119.7871°W, which is about -119.7871.

Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno, so it should have a smaller west longitude, like 119.3°W or something.

Earlier I had 119.3183°W
