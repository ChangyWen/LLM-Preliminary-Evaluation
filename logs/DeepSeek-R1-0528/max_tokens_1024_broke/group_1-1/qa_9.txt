*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy, died later than William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. That means I have to find out their death dates and compare them.

I should recall who these historical figures are. Agnes of Aquitaine was a noblewoman from the 11th century. She was the daughter of William V, Duke of Aquitaine, and she married Otto-William, Count of Burgundy, and later became Countess of Savoy through her marriage to Peter I, Count of Savoy. But I think I might be confusing her with another Agnes. Let me think carefully.

Actually, Agnes of Aquitaine is often associated with the House of Poitiers. She was married to Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, but that might be a different Agnes. I need to focus on the Countess of Savoy part.

Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy: I believe this refers to Agnes, who was the wife of Peter I of Savoy. Peter I was Count of Savoy from about 1060 to 1078. Agnes was his wife, and she was the daughter of William V, Duke of Aquitaine.

Now, William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey: He was a Norman nobleman who fought in the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and was granted the Earldom of Surrey by William the Conqueror. He died in 1088, I think.

I need death dates for both.

Let me start with William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. He was born around the 1030s and died in 1088. I recall that he was killed at the siege of Pevensey Castle or something like that. Yes, he died in 1088 during a rebellion against William II.

So, William de Warenne died in 1088.

Now, Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy. I need to find her death date.

Agnes of Aquitaine was married to Peter I of Savoy. Peter I died in 1078. But what about Agnes?

Agnes was the daughter of William V of Aquitaine. William V died in 1030, so Agnes was probably born around the 1020s or 1030s.

She married Peter I of Savoy around 1046 or something. Peter I became Count of Savoy in 1048 and died in 1078.

After Peter's death, Agnes might have lived longer. I think she died later.

I remember that Agnes of Aquitaine was also the mother of Bertha of Savoy, who married Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Bertha was born around 1051, and Agnes was her mother.

Agnes died in 1068? That doesn't sound right.

I think I have a confusion. There are multiple Agnes in this period.

Agnes of Aquitaine, who married Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, died in 1077. But that's not the Countess of Savoy.

The Countess of Savoy is Agnes of Aquitaine, wife of Peter I.

Peter I of Savoy died in 1078. Agnes survived him and died later.

I found online or recall that Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy, died in 1087 or something. I need to be careful.

Perhaps I can think about her children.

Agnes and Peter had several children, including Amadeus II of Savoy, who was born around 1050 and became count after Peter's death in 1078.

Amadeus II died in 1080, which is young, but that's not Agnes.

Agnes herself: I think she died in the late 11th century.

Upon second thought, I believe Agnes of Aquitaine died around 1068. But that might be too early.

Let's calculate based on her birth.

William V of Aquitaine died in 1030. Agnes was one of his daughters. He had multiple wives, but Agnes was from his first marriage to Adalemode of Limoges, I think.

William V married Adalemode around 1010 or so, and Agnes was born around 1012-1020.

Then she married Otto-William, Count of Burgundy, but Otto-William died in 1026, which is too early if Agnes was born after 1010. That doesn't add up.

I think I'm mixing up generations.

Agnes of Aquitaine who married Otto-William was the mother of Reginald I, Count of Burgundy, but that was earlier.

The Agnes who became Countess of Savoy was a different one.

For the Countess of Savoy: Agnes of Aquitaine was the daughter of William V, Duke of Aquitaine, and Agnes of Burgundy. William V married Agnes of Burgundy around
