*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking if ZIP code 83703 is less densely populated than ZIP code 79104. They want a step-by-step reasoning and a final yes or no answer.

I need to recall what ZIP codes represent. ZIP codes are postal codes used by the US Postal Service. 83703 is in Idaho, and 79104 is in Texas, based on the IDs given: ID for Idaho and TX for Texas.

The question is about population density, which is typically measured as people per square mile or per square kilometer. So, I need to find the population density for both ZIP codes and compare them.

But I don't have this data off the top of my head. I might need to look it up or recall general knowledge. Since I'm an AI, I can access or recall stored data, but I should be careful with real-time data. Perhaps I can use general knowledge or known facts about these areas.

Let me think about where these ZIP codes are:

- 83703: This is in Boise, Idaho. Boise is the capital of Idaho and a city, but I'm not sure about the specific density of this ZIP code.

- 79104: This is in Amarillo, Texas. Amarillo is a city in the Texas Panhandle.

Now, Idaho is generally less populated than Texas, but we're comparing specific ZIP codes, not the entire states. So, I need ZIP code-level data.

I remember that ZIP codes can vary in size and population. Urban ZIP codes might be densely populated, while rural ones are not.

83703, Boise, Idaho: Boise is a growing city, but it's not as large as major Texas cities. However, 83703 might be a specific area.

79104, Amarillo, Texas: Amarillo is a mid-sized city. Texas has larger cities like Houston or Dallas, but Amarillo is smaller.

But I need density, not just population. Density depends on both population and land area.

I should try to find approximate data. Since I can't browse the internet, I'll rely on internal knowledge or common sense.

Perhaps I can infer based on typical densities.

First, let's consider Amarillo, TX. Amarillo has a population of around 200,000 people. ZIP code 79104 is one part of it. I think 79104 might be a residential area, but I'm not sure.

Similarly, for Boise, ZIP code 83703. Boise has a population of about 230,000, and 83703 is likely a central or suburban area.

But I need specific numbers.

I recall that population density data for ZIP codes is available from sources like the US Census Bureau. For example, from the 2020 Census or American Community Survey.

But I don't have that data memorized.

Perhaps I can think about the characteristics.

Amarillo is in the Texas Panhandle, which is somewhat flat and spread out. Boise is in a valley, which might be more compact.

But I'm speculating.

Another idea: I can use the fact that ZIP codes starting with certain numbers indicate regions, but for density, that's not helpful.

837 is Idaho, 791 is Texas, but that's all.

I think I need to look for data. Since this is a reasoning exercise, I might recall or estimate.

Perhaps the user expects me to know or to reason based on available information.

I can think about city densities generally.

Boise, Idaho: The city has a population density of about 2,600 people per square mile, I think. But that's for the city, not the ZIP code.

Similarly, Amarillo, Texas: I think it has a lower density, around 1,900 people per square mile or something. I'm not sure.

Let me try to be more precise.

I remember that for ZIP code 83703, it's in downtown Boise or near it, so it might be dense.

For 79104, it's in Amarillo, which is less dense.

But I need data.

Perhaps I can calculate based on available figures.

Since I'm an AI, I can access a knowledge base. Let me see if I have stored data.

In my training data, I might have general knowledge.

I recall that 83703, Boise, ID, has a population of about 15,000 and an area of about 2.5 square miles, so density is around 6,000 per square mile.

I'm not sure; that might be wrong.

Similarly, for 79104, Amarillo, TX, I think it has a larger area. Let's say population of 20,000 and area of 10 square miles, so density of 2,000 per square mile.

But I need real numbers.

I think I should use a reliable source.

Since I can't browse, I'll assume based on common knowledge.

I found online in my memory: for 83703, population density is approximately 3,
