*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine the lifespans of Anastasia of Sirmium and William II, Count of Chalon. I should look up their historical dates.

Starting with Anastasia of Sirmium. I recall that she is a Christian saint and martyr. I think she lived during the Roman Empire period. Sirmium was in Pannonia, which is modern-day Serbia. She was martyred, so she died young. I need her birth and death years.

From what I remember, Anastasia of Sirmium was martyred during the Diocletianic Persecution in the early 4th century. Diocletian reigned from 284 to 305 AD, and the persecutions were around 303-305 AD. I think she died around 304 AD. But I'm not sure about her birth year. Saints often don't have precise birth dates, but she was probably young when martyred, maybe in her 20s or 30s. But for comparison, I need at least the death year.

Let me confirm: Saint Anastasia is said to have been martyred on December 25, 304 AD. Is that right? I think there might be some confusion because there's also Anastasia the Patrician, but Anastasia of Sirmium is the one celebrated on December 25. Actually, upon second thought, her feast day is December 25, but that might be tied to Christmas. Let me think differently.

I should look for reliable sources. Since I can't access the internet, I'll rely on my knowledge. Anastasia of Sirmium died around 304 AD during the persecutions.

Now, William II, Count of Chalon. Chalon-sur-Saône, I assume. He was a medieval noble. I think he lived in the 13th or 14th century? Let me recall.

William II of Chalon was Count of Auxerre and Tonnerre, I think. Chalon might refer to several places, but I believe it's Chalon in Burgundy. William II, I think he died in 1304. But I need to be precise.

I remember that William II of Chalon was involved in the Franco-Flemish wars. He was killed at the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302. Is that right? The Battle of the Golden Spurs was in 1302, and the French were defeated by the Flemish. But was William II there?

Upon recollection, William II, Count of Auvergne and Boulogne, but that might be different. Let's clarify: William II of Chalon-sur-Saône. I think he was Count from 1248 to 1304. And he died in 1304.

But let's pin this down. I think William II of Chalon died in 1304 AD.

Now, comparing death years: Anastasia died around 304 AD, William died in 1304 AD. That's a difference of about 1000 years, so Anastasia died much earlier.

But the question is: did she live longer? Meaning, did she have a longer lifespan, or did she live to a later date? The phrasing: "live longer than" could mean lifespan or time period.

Let me read the question: "Did Anastasia of Sirmium live longer than William II, Count of Chalon?"

In common usage, "live longer" usually refers to having a greater lifespan, i.e., more years lived. But sometimes it can be misinterpreted as living to a later date. However, I think in this context, it's about lifespan.

But let's see the exact phrasing. It says "live longer," which typically means age.

Moreover, if it were about time period, it would be clear that Anastasia lived earlier, so she didn't live to a later date.

But to be thorough, I should consider both.

First, lifespan: how long each lived.

For Anastasia, she was a martyr, so she died young. I think she was in her 20s or 30s. Let's find specific information.

Historical records for saints are often not precise. But according to tradition, Saint Anastasia was martyred at a young age. I think she was born around 281 AD and died in 304 AD, so about 23 years old. But I'm not sure.

I recall that she was married, but her husband died, and then she was persecuted. But I don't have exact birth dates.

Similarly, for William II, I need his birth and death.

William II, Count of Chalon: I believe he was born in the mid-13th century. Let's say he was born around 1240 or so. Died in 1304.

Upon recollection, William II of Chalon-sur-Saône was born in 1235 and died in 1304, so he lived about 69 years.

But I need to confirm.

Perhaps I can think of another
