*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Garnavillo, IA is east of Newellton, LA. Both are in the US, with Garnavillo in Iowa (IA) and Newellton in Louisiana (LA).

I should figure out the approximate coordinates for both places to compare their longitudes. Since east and west are determined by longitude, a place with a higher longitude is further east if we're using the standard where east increases from the prime meridian.

The prime meridian is at 0 degrees, and as you go east, longitude increases to 180 degrees east. In the US, longitudes are west, so they're negative if we use the convention where west is negative. For example, New York might be around -74 degrees, meaning 74 degrees west.

To make it easier, I can think in terms of degrees west, but for comparison, a smaller longitude (more negative) is further west, and a larger longitude (less negative) is further east.

Let me find the coordinates.

I'll start with Garnavillo, IA. Garnavillo is a small town in Clayton County, Iowa. I think it's in the northeast part of Iowa, near the Mississippi River.

Similarly, Newellton, LA is in Tensas Parish, Louisiana, which is in the northeast part of Louisiana, also near the Mississippi River.

Since both are near the Mississippi, but in different states, I need specific longitudes.

I should look up the latitudes and longitudes. Since this is a reasoning exercise, I might recall or estimate.

I know that Iowa is north of Louisiana, so latitude-wise, Garnavillo is north of Newellton, but for east-west, it depends on longitude.

Let me think about the Mississippi River. The river flows south, so towns along it might have similar longitudes in some places, but it meanders.

Garnavillo, IA is near the Mississippi. Let me find its coordinates.

I recall that Dubuque, Iowa is a larger city on the Mississippi, and Garnavillo is east of Dubuque or something? Clayton County is in the very eastern part of Iowa.

Similarly, Newellton, LA is in northeastern Louisiana.

I should look for the longitude values.

Since I don't have a map, I can reason based on state positions.

Iowa is west of Illinois, and Louisiana is west of Mississippi, but both are in the central US.

The central meridian for the US is around 90 degrees west, but it varies.

Let me assign approximate longitudes.

First, for Newellton, LA. I know that New Orleans is around 90 degrees west longitude. Newellton is north of New Orleans. Tensas Parish is near the Mississippi border.

I think Vicksburg, Mississippi is around 90 degrees west. Newellton is west of the Mississippi River in Louisiana.

Tensas Parish is on the east side of Louisiana, bordering Mississippi.

Newellton, LA: I believe it's near the river. Let's say approximately 91 degrees west or something.

I need better estimates.

I can think that the Mississippi River runs roughly north-south, so longitudes change.

At the top, in Minnesota, it's around 93 degrees west, and at the bottom, in Louisiana, it's around 91 degrees west near New Orleans, but it varies.

For Garnavillo, IA: Iowa's eastern border is along the Mississippi. Clayton County is the far northeast county in Iowa, so it should be around 91 degrees west or less.

Dubuque, Iowa is at approximately 90.7 degrees west longitude.

Let me confirm: Dubuque, IA longitude is about 90.67 degrees west.

Garnavillo is east of Dubuque? Clayton County is north of Dubuque County. Dubuque is in Dubuque County, and Clayton is the next county north, still along the river.

Garnavillo is in Clayton County, which is directly north of Dubuque County. Since the river flows south, but longitude should be similar.

Dubuque is at 90.67째 W, so Garnavillo might be similar or slightly different.

Actually, since it's north, longitude might be slightly higher if the river bends, but generally, along the river, longitude is similar.

I think for east-west, it should be comparable.

Let's find Garnavillo specifically.

I recall that Garnavillo, IA has a longitude of about 91.09 degrees west or something? I'm not sure.

Perhaps I can think of the state centroids.

Iowa's approximate center is around 93.4째 W, but Garnavillo is on the eastern border, so it should be less than that.

Louisiana's center is around 92.5째 W, but Newellton is in the northeast.

Newellton, LA: Tensas Parish. I think it's near Tallulah, LA, which is around 91.2째
