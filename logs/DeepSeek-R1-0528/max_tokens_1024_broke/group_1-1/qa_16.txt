*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if The Ort Institute, IL is located west of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI. I should start by finding the locations of both places.

Let me recall what I know about these institutions. The Ort Institute – I think it might be related to ORT, which is a global education network, but I'm not sure about an "Ort Institute" in Illinois. Perhaps it's a misspelling or a specific campus. I should look for "ORT Institute" or something similar.

Upon second thought, I believe "Ort" might be a typo or shorthand. ORT is often associated with World ORT, which has institutions worldwide. But in Illinois, there might be something called the Illinois Institute of Technology or another school. I need to clarify.

Actually, I think the user might mean "Illinois Institute of Technology" or IIT, which is in Chicago, IL. But it says "The Ort Institute," which could be different. Let me double-check.

Perhaps "Ort" refers to ORT America or something. But I should proceed with the information given. Let's assume "The Ort Institute, IL" is a place in Illinois. For the sake of this question, I'll treat it as a specific location.

Similarly, University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is part of the University of Wisconsin system, located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

Now, to compare their locations, I need the geographic coordinates or at least the longitudes to see which one is west.

Since I don't have direct access to a map, I'll use my general knowledge of US geography.

First, let's find Sheboygan, WI. Sheboygan is a city in eastern Wisconsin, on the western shore of Lake Michigan. It's in the eastern part of the state.

Now, for "The Ort Institute, IL." If this is in Illinois, Illinois is to the south and west of Wisconsin. But Illinois is a large state, so I need to be more specific.

I recall that ORT might be associated with the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) is in Chicago, IL. And ORT has connections; I think there might be an ORT program there, but I'm not sure if it's called "The Ort Institute."

Perhaps "The Ort Institute" is not a real place, or it's a mistake. Let me think if there's a specific Ort Institute in Illinois.

Upon a quick mental search, I believe the user might be referring to the "ORT Technical Institute" or something similar, but I think it's defunct or not widely known. For simplicity, I'll assume that "The Ort Institute, IL" is located in Chicago, as that's the major city in Illinois and likely where such an institution might be.

So, let's proceed with:

- University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI: Sheboygan, WI

- The Ort Institute, IL: Chicago, IL (assuming)

Now, Sheboygan, WI is approximately at longitude around -87.7 or something. I need coordinates.

I know that Chicago, IL is at approximately 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W.

Sheboygan, WI is at approximately 43.7508° N, 87.7145° W.

Let me verify that.

From memory: Chicago, IL longitude is about 87.63° W.

Sheboygan, WI longitude: Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee. Milwaukee is about 87.90° W, and Sheboygan is further north, so it might be similar or slightly east.

Actually, let's think about the Lake Michigan shoreline. Places along the shore have similar longitudes because the lake runs north-south.

Chicago is on the southwest shore of Lake Michigan, while Sheboygan is on the west shore, north of Milwaukee.

Milwaukee is about 87.91° W, and Chicago is about 87.63° W. Since Chicago is south, but longitude: as you go west, longitude increases negatively in the western hemisphere.

Longitude is measured in degrees west from the prime meridian. So more negative means further west.

In decimal degrees, west longitudes are negative.

So, a larger numerical value (more negative) means further west.

For example:

- Chicago, IL: approximately 87.63° W, which is -87.63

- Sheboygan, WI: let me find its longitude.

I think Sheboygan is around 87.71° W or something. Let me estimate.

Since both are on Lake Michigan, Chicago is at the south end, Sheboygan at the north, but the shoreline is not straight; it curves a bit.

Generally, the longitude difference might be small.

Chicago: 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W

Sheboygan: I believe it's about 43.7508° N, 87
