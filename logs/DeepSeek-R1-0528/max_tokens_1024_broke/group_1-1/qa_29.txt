*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Medina Lake located north of Rara Lake?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a yes or no answer.

I need to know where these lakes are located. Medina Lake and Rara Lake. I think Rara Lake is in Nepal, and Medina Lake might be in the United States, probably Texas. I should confirm that.

Rara Lake: I remember that Rara Lake is the largest lake in Nepal, located in the Himalayas. Specifically, it's in the Rara National Park in the Karnali Province.

Medina Lake: I believe this is Medina Lake in Texas, USA. It's a reservoir near San Antonio.

Now, I need to determine their relative positions: is Medina Lake north of Rara Lake?

To compare their latitudes, since "north" refers to latitude. I should find the approximate latitudes of both lakes.

Starting with Rara Lake in Nepal:

- Rara Lake is at about 29.5°N latitude. Let me confirm that.

I think Rara Lake is around 29°30'N. I should be precise.

From my knowledge, Rara Lake is situated at approximately 29.52°N latitude and 82.08°E longitude.

Now, for Medina Lake in Texas:

- Medina Lake is in Medina County, Texas. Its coordinates are approximately 29.55°N latitude and 98.93°W longitude.

I need to ensure these coordinates are accurate. Let me think.

I recall that San Antonio, Texas, is around 29.42°N. Medina Lake is northwest of San Antonio, so it should be slightly higher in latitude.

Upon a quick mental check: San Antonio is at 29.42°N, and Medina Lake is a bit north, say around 29.55°N to 29.6°N.

I found online or from memory that Medina Lake coordinates are roughly 29.55°N, 98.93°W.

Similarly, Rara Lake: I think it's at 29.52°N, 82.08°E.

Now, comparing the latitudes:

- Rara Lake: ~29.52°N

- Medina Lake: ~29.55°N

So, Medina Lake is at 29.55°N, and Rara Lake is at 29.52°N. That means Medina Lake is slightly north of Rara Lake.

29.55°N is greater than 29.52°N, so yes, it is north.

But let's be precise. Is this difference significant?

Latitude is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds. 29.52°N is 29 degrees and 0.52 minutes, which is about 29°31.2'N (since 0.52 * 60 = 31.2 minutes).

Similarly, 29.55°N is 29 degrees and 0.55 minutes, which is 29°33.0'N (0.55 * 60 = 33 minutes).

So, Rara Lake: 29°31.2'N

Medina Lake: 29°33.0'N

Therefore, Medina Lake is about 1.8 minutes north of Rara Lake. Since one minute of latitude is about 1.85 km, that's roughly 3.33 km north.

But the question is just whether it's north, not how much. So, technically, yes, it is north.

Is there any chance I have the wrong lakes?

Perhaps there's another Medina Lake? I think the most well-known is in Texas.

Rara Lake is definitely in Nepal.

Maybe Medina Lake refers to something else, but I doubt it. Let me confirm.

Another thought: Medina could be a city, but the lake is specifically Medina Lake in Texas.

Perhaps in Saudi Arabia, but Medina is a city, not a lake. Medina Lake is in Texas.

Rara Lake is in Nepal.

Now, longitudes: Rara Lake is at 82°E, Medina Lake at 99°W, so they are on opposite sides, but latitude is what matters for north-south.

Since both are around 29.5°N, but Medina is slightly higher.

But let me double-check the coordinates.

I can think about the countries.

Nepal is in Asia, between approximately 26°N and 30°N latitude. Rara Lake is in the northwest part, so around 29.5°N is reasonable.

Texas is in the southern US, with latitudes from about 25°N to 36°N. San Antonio is around 29.4°N, and Medina Lake is nearby, so 29.55°N seems right.

Perhaps I should use a more reliable source, but since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll go with what I know.

Another way: I know that the Tropic of Cancer is at 23.5°N, so both
