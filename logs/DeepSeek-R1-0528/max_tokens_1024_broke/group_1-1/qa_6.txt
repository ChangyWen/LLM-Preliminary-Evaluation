*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to compare the publication dates of two articles: "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal." and "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained." The question is whether the first one was published earlier than the second one.

I should look for the dates these articles were published. Since I don't have direct access to a database, I need to recall or infer based on general knowledge or common sources. But these seem like real news articles, so I might need to think about when they might have been in the news.

Let me start by considering the topics to estimate the time periods.

The first article: "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal." This sounds like it's about U.S. politics, specifically related to a deficit deal and a congressional recess. I remember that there have been several instances where the U.S. government faced deadlines for budget deals to avoid shutdowns. One prominent period was around 2011 with the debt ceiling crisis. But recesses happen multiple times, so I need to be specific.

Perhaps this is from The New York Times or a similar outlet. I think I recall an article like this from 2011. Let me confirm: in July 2011, there was a big debate over the debt ceiling, and Congress was about to go on recess. Yes, that might be it.

Now, the second article: "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained." This is about Russian politics. Moscow mayoral electionsâ€”when did that happen? I think there was an election in 2013 where Alexei Navalny ran for mayor. He was an opposition activist and was detained multiple times.

Specifically, I recall that Navalny was detained in July 2013 during his campaign. I think he was arrested or detained briefly around that time.

So, for the first article: if it's about the 2011 debt ceiling, it would be from July or August 2011.

For the second article: the Moscow mayoral election was in September 2013, and Navalny was detained in July 2013.

But I need exact dates to compare.

Perhaps I can think of the sources. The user might expect me to know or infer based on common knowledge.

Maybe these articles are from The New York Times archives or something. But I don't have access right now.

Another thought: in the context of this conversation, perhaps these are articles that were previously mentioned or are well-known.

I should search my knowledge base.

Let me try to recall specific dates.

For "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal.":

I believe this is a New York Times article from July 22, 2011. I think that's when the debt ceiling debate was heating up, and Congress had a recess coming up. Let me confirm: yes, in late July 2011, there were articles about the ticking clock for a deficit deal before the August recess.

For example, on July 22, 2011, The New York Times published an article titled "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal." I think that's right.

Now, for "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained.":

This should be about Alexei Navalny. He announced his candidacy in June 2013 and was detained multiple times. One notable detention was on July 18, 2013, when he was released but then detained again shortly after.

I think The New York Times had an article about it. Let me see: on July 18, 2013, there was an article titled "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained." or something similar.

Upon second thought, I recall that on July 18, 2013, Navalny was detained and released the same day, and it was widely reported.

So, let's list the dates:

- Article 1: "Clock Is Ticking..." published on July 22, 2011.

- Article 2: "Activist Running..." published on July 18, 2013.

Now, comparing: July 22, 2011 vs. July 18, 2013.

2011 is earlier than 2013, so July 22, 2011, comes before July 18, 2013.

Therefore, the first article was published earlier.

The question is: "Was 'Clock Is Ticking...' published earlier than 'Activist Running...'?"

Based on this, yes, 2011 is earlier than 2013.

But let me double-check the dates to be sure.

For the 2011 article: I'm pretty sure about the debt ceiling issue in July 2011. Specifically, Congress was set to recess in early August, and negotiations were intense in late July. The article title matches.

For the 2013 article: Navalny was detained on July 18, 2013
