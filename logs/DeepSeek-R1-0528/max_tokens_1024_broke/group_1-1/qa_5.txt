Is RED BALLOON LEARNING CENTER, Manhattan located east of HUNTERS POINT S PARK PLAYGROUND, Queens? Show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No).
*********************************** End of Inputs **************************************




*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if the RED BALLOON LEARNING CENTER in Manhattan is east of HUNTERS POINT S PARK PLAYGROUND in Queens. Both locations are in New York City, but in different boroughs: Manhattan and Queens.

I should recall the geography of NYC. Manhattan is to the west of Queens. Generally, Manhattan is west of Queens, so anything in Manhattan should be west of anything in Queens, right? But I need to be specific because "east" is a relative direction.

HUNTERS POINT S PARK PLAYGROUND is in Queens, specifically in Long Island City, which is the western part of Queens. RED BALLOON LEARNING CENTER is in Manhattan. Since Manhattan is west of Queens, the learning center should be west of the playground, not east.

But let me confirm the locations more precisely.

First, find the exact locations:

- HUNTERS POINT S PARK PLAYGROUND: This is in Hunters Point, Queens. Hunters Point is a neighborhood in Long Island City, which is on the waterfront facing Manhattan. The playground is part of Hunters Point South Park, which is along the East River.

- RED BALLOON LEARNING CENTER: This is in Manhattan. I think it's on the Upper West Side, but I should confirm. Upon a quick mental search, I believe the Red Balloon Learning Center is located at 310 West 95th Street, Manhattan, NY 10025. That's on the Upper West Side.

Now, to compare directions:

- Manhattan is west of Queens.

- Specifically, the Upper West Side of Manhattan is on the west side of Manhattan island.

- Hunters Point in Queens is on the east side of the East River, directly across from Midtown Manhattan.

So, if I imagine a map:

- The East River separates Manhattan from Queens.

- Manhattan is to the west of the East River.

- Queens is to the east of the East River.

Therefore, any point in Manhattan is west of any point in Queens because Queens is east of Manhattan.

But is that always true? Let's think about the curvature. Generally, yes, but I should consider the specific points.

Hunters Point South Park Playground: This is in Queens, near the waterfront. Let's say it's around 50th Avenue and Center Boulevard, Long Island City, NY 11101.

Red Balloon Learning Center: 310 West 95th Street, Manhattan, NY 10025.

Now, longitudes: To determine east-west, I need longitude values, since east-west is measured by longitude, with higher longitude being further east.

I need approximate coordinates.

I know that in NYC, the longitude decreases as you go west.

Standard longitude: Prime Meridian is at 0, and decreases westward in the US since it's west of Greenwich.

For simplicity, let's use the concept that Manhattan has a lower longitude than Queens because it's west.

Recall:

- Manhattan: Central Park, for example, is around 73.97° W longitude.

- Queens: Long Island City is around 73.94° W or something? I need better numbers.

Longitude: As you go east, longitude increases (in the western hemisphere, it's negative, but the magnitude decreases as you go east).

In decimal degrees, for New York:

- Manhattan: approximately 74.00° W to 73.90° W, but it varies. Typically, the west side is around 74.01° W, and east side around 73.97° W for the island.

Let's think of specific points.

Hunters Point: This is in Queens, near the East River. Let's say it's at about 40.742° N, 73.960° W or something. I need to recall.

I can reason relatively.

The East River runs north-south, but it's tidal, so it's roughly vertical.

Hunters Point is directly east of Midtown Manhattan. For example, opposite around 42nd Street or so.

42nd Street Manhattan is at about 73.985° W.

Hunters Point, Queens, is at about 40.742° N, 73.958° W (I'm approximating).

Now, Red Balloon Learning Center is on the Upper West Side. 310 West 95th Street.

95th Street in Manhattan is at about 40.790° N, 73.970° W or so.

Let me get better estimates.

Generally, streets in Manhattan: the longitude decreases as you go west, but since Manhattan is tilted, it's not perfectly aligned.

Manhattan is oriented roughly north-south, but with a tilt.

The west side of Manhattan has a higher longitude magnitude (more west) than the east side.

Longitude: all negative for NYC.

- At 5th Avenue, which is roughly central, longitude is about 73.97° W for Midtown.

- At the west side, near the
