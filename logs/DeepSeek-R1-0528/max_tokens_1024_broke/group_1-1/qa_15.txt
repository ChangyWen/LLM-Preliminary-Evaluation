*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is The University of Tampa, FL located north of Schiller International University, FL?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Both universities are in Florida, so I should figure out their locations. I know The University of Tampa is in Tampa, Florida. Schiller International University has multiple campuses, but the one in question is in Florida, specifically in Largo, I think. I should confirm that.

Schiller International University has a campus in Florida, and I believe it's in Largo, which is near Tampa. Largo is part of the Tampa Bay area, but I need to be precise about the cities.

Let me recall:

- The University of Tampa is located in downtown Tampa, Florida.

- Schiller International University has a campus in Florida, and I think it's in Largo, Florida.

Largo is a city in Pinellas County, which is west of Tampa, across the bay. Tampa is in Hillsborough County.

Now, to determine if one is north of the other, I need to compare their latitudes, since north-south direction is determined by latitude.

So, I should find the latitude of Tampa, FL, and the latitude of Largo, FL, since Schiller International University is in Largo.

But is Schiller International University definitely in Largo? Let me double-check that.

Upon thinking, I remember that Schiller International University has a campus in Tampa as well? No, I think the Florida campus is in Largo. Let me confirm with my knowledge.

Actually, Schiller International University used to have a campus in Dunedin, Florida, but I think it moved or something. I should look for reliable information, but since I'm an AI, I can access my internal knowledge base.

From what I know, Schiller International University's Florida campus is located in Largo, FL. Yes.

Now, Tampa and Largo are both in the Tampa Bay area. Tampa is on the east side of Tampa Bay, and Largo is on the west side, on the Pinellas Peninsula.

Geographically, is Tampa north of Largo or south?

I need the actual coordinates or at least a general sense of their positions.

Let me think about the map. Tampa is roughly at latitude 27.95° N, and Largo is at about 27.91° N or something like that. I need to be more precise.

I can reason based on cities. Tampa includes areas from about 27.9° N to 28.0° N, but the University of Tampa is in downtown, which is around 27.95° N.

Schiller International University in Largo: Largo's coordinates are approximately 27.91° N.

But let me get the exact latitudes.

Assuming I don't have real-time data, I should use common geographical knowledge.

Tampa Bay runs north-south, with St. Petersburg and Clearwater to the west, and Tampa to the east.

Largo is between Clearwater and St. Petersburg, so it's on the western shore.

Now, comparing Tampa and Largo:

- Tampa: Latitude about 27.95° N

- Largo: Latitude about 27.91° N

Since 27.95 is greater than 27.91, Tampa has a higher latitude, meaning it is north of Largo.

Latitude increases as you go north, so a higher number means farther north.

27.95° N vs. 27.91° N: 27.95 is greater, so Tampa is north of Largo.

Therefore, The University of Tampa is north of Schiller International University in Largo.

But is Schiller International University in Largo? Let me confirm the location.

Upon second thought, I think Schiller International University might have closed some campuses, but for this purpose, we're considering its location when it was operational or as per common reference.

The question says "Schiller International University, FL", so it's referring to the Florida campus, which is in Largo.

Perhaps I should specify.

Another thing: is there a campus in Tampa itself? I don't think so. Schiller International University is a private university with international campuses, and in Florida, it's in Largo.

Yes.

So, University of Tampa is in Tampa, FL, at approximately 27.9467° N latitude.

Schiller International University, Largo campus, is at approximately 27.9167° N latitude. (I'm approximating based on Largo's center or the area.)

Since 27.9467 > 27.9167, Tampa is north of Largo.

Therefore, University of Tampa is north of Schiller International University.

But to be thorough, let's consider if the university locations are exactly at those points.

The University of Tampa is located at 401 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33606. Its latitude is about 27.946° N.

Schiller International University was
