*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Lake Martin, AL located south of Dal-Tex Building, TX?" I need to reason step by step and give a final yes or no answer.

I need to know the locations of both places. Lake Martin is in Alabama, and Dal-Tex Building is in Texas. Specifically, Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, Texas. I should confirm the exact locations.

Let me start with Dal-Tex Building, TX. I know that the Dal-Tex Building is a historic building in Dallas, Texas. It's located in downtown Dallas. To be precise, I should find its coordinates or at least the city and state.

Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, Texas. Dallas is in the northern part of Texas. Texas is a large state, so I need to be specific.

Now, Lake Martin, AL. Lake Martin is a reservoir in Alabama. I think it's in central Alabama, near cities like Alexander City. Alabama is south of Texas, but since Texas is large, I need to compare latitudes.

The key is to compare the latitudes because "south" refers to latitude. A place is south of another if its latitude is lower (more towards the equator).

So, I need the latitudes of both locations.

Let me find the latitude of Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, Texas.

Dallas, Texas has a latitude of approximately 32.7767° N. I think that's for the city center. Since Dal-Tex Building is in downtown, it should be similar.

Confirming: Dallas coordinates are about 32.7767° N, 96.7970° W.

Now, Lake Martin, AL. Lake Martin is a large lake, so I need a specific point, but generally, it's in Tallapoosa County, Alabama. The main area is around Alexander City.

Alexander City, Alabama has a latitude of approximately 32.9445° N, 85.9517° W.

But Lake Martin itself spans multiple areas. The lake is centered around 32.7° N or something. Let me get a better estimate.

I can use a reference point. For example, the dam or a central location.

Looking it up in my knowledge: Lake Martin is located at about 32.63° N, 85.83° W. I need to be accurate.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I should use approximate values.

Recall: Alabama is generally south of Texas, but Texas extends far south, and Dallas is in north Texas.

Texas has a panhandle that is north, but Dallas is not in the panhandle; it's in north-central Texas.

Alabama is east of Texas, but for north-south, we care about latitude.

Latitude of Dallas, TX: approximately 32.8° N.

Latitude of Lake Martin, AL: Let's say Alexander City is near the lake. Alexander City is at 32.94° N.

32.94° N? That seems high. Let me double-check.

I think I have a mistake. Alabama is south of Tennessee and north of Florida, so latitudes around 30° to 35° N.

For example, Montgomery, Alabama is about 32.36° N.

Lake Martin is near Dadeville or Alexander City.

Alexander City, AL: Latitude 32.9445° N? That can't be right because that would be north of Dallas? No.

Dallas is at 32.78° N, and if Alexander City is at 32.94° N, that would be slightly north, but I think I'm confusing something.

Let me clarify:

- Dallas, TX latitude: 32.7767° N

- Now, Alexander City, AL: I think it's around 32.9° N, but let's confirm with another city.

Lake Martin is primarily in Tallapoosa County. The city of Eclectic, Alabama is near Lake Martin, at approximately 32.635° N, 86.035° W.

Or, the lake itself: coordinates for Lake Martin Dam are about 32.618° N, 85.927° W.

I found online that the center of Lake Martin is approximately 32.63° N, 85.83° W.

But to simplify, let's use 32.6° N for Lake Martin.

Now, Dallas, TX is at 32.78° N.

So, 32.6° N vs 32.78° N.

32.6 is less than 32.78, so Lake Martin has a lower latitude, meaning it is south of Dallas.

Latitude decreases as you go south, so lower latitude means further south.

32.6° N is south of 32.78° N because 32.6 is smaller.

Numerically, 32.6 < 32.78, so yes, 32.6° N is south of 32.78° N.

Therefore, Lake Martin, AL should
