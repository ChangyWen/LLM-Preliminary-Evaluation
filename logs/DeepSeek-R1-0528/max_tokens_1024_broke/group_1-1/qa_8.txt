*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: Was Yao Shu born earlier than Alfonso of Molina? I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a yes or no answer.

I need to find the birth years of both Yao Shu and Alfonso of Molina. I should recall who they are.

Starting with Yao Shu. I think Yao Shu was a Chinese statesman during the Yuan Dynasty. He was a close advisor to Kublai Khan. I believe he was born around 1201 or 1202. Let me confirm that.

From what I remember, Yao Shu was born in 1202. I think that's right. But I should double-check.

Now, Alfonso of Molina. I'm not as familiar with him. I think he was a Spanish noble, possibly related to the kings of Castile. Alfonso of Molina... I think he was the son of King Alfonso IX of León and Berengaria of Castile. And he was the Lord of Molina.

I need his birth year. I think he was born in 1202 as well. That might be a coincidence.

Let me think: Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202? Or was it different?

I should look for reliable sources, but since I'm reasoning step by step, I'll use my knowledge and logic.

I recall that Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202 and died in 1272. But I need to be sure.

Yao Shu: I think he was born in 1202 and died in 1280.

If both were born in 1202, then they were born in the same year, so Yao Shu was not born earlier; they were contemporaries.

But is that accurate? Maybe one was born earlier.

Let me try to recall more precisely.

Yao Shu: He was a Confucian scholar and served under Kublai Khan. Kublai Khan was born in 1215, and Yao Shu was older than him. Kublai founded the Yuan Dynasty in 1271. Yao Shu was born in the early 13th century.

Upon second thought, I believe Yao Shu was born in 1202.

Now, Alfonso of Molina: He was the son of Alfonso IX of León, who reigned from 1188 to 1230. Alfonso IX married Berengaria in 1197, I think, and their children were born after that.

Alfonso of Molina was one of their sons. I think he was born around 1202 or 1204.

I remember that Alfonso, Lord of Molina, was born in 1202.

Similarly, his brother Ferdinand III of Castile was born in 1199, I think.

Ferdinand III was born in 1199, and Alfonso was his younger brother, so probably born after 1199.

Let's assume Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202 for now.

But I need to be more precise.

Perhaps I can think about historical events.

Another way: Yao Shu was involved in the Mongol conquests. He advised Kublai Khan during the establishment of the Yuan Dynasty.

Kublai was born in 1215, and Yao Shu was much older, so born around 1200.

Similarly, Alfonso of Molina lived during the 13th century in Spain. He participated in the Reconquista and died in 1272.

I think I have a memory: Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202.

Yao Shu: Let me confirm. I think Yao Shu was born in 1203 or something. I'm not sure.

Perhaps I should consider that the question might be tricky, and one was born earlier.

Let's search my knowledge base.

I recall that Yao Shu was born in 1202 AD.

Alfonso of Molina: Born 1202, died 1272.

Yes, that seems consistent.

If both were born in 1202, then neither was born earlier; they were born in the same year.

But the question is "born earlier," which would be no if they were born in the same year.

However, birth years might not be exact to the day, so we might need to see if there's a difference.

But in history, we often go by the year.

Perhaps one was born before 1202.

Let's think about Alfonso of Molina's parents.

Alfonso IX of León married Berengaria of Castile in 1197. Their first child was a daughter, then Ferdinand III born in 1199, then Alfonso of Molina.

Alfonso of Molina was the third child, I think, born in 1202 or 1203.

I found online in my memory that he was born in 1202.

Similarly for Yao Shu, sources say 1202.

But let's see if I can find a discrepancy.

Another thought: Yao Shu might have been born in 1201. I think I have a source that says 1201.

Upon recollection, some sources say Yao Shu was born in 1201, others in 120
