*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Cambria County, PA is west of Cattaraugus County, NY. To do this, I should look at the geographic locations of both counties, specifically their longitudes, since longitude measures east-west position.

I know that Pennsylvania (PA) and New York (NY) are adjacent states. Cambria County is in Pennsylvania, and Cattaraugus County is in New York. Cattaraugus County is in the western part of New York, near the Pennsylvania border.

Let me recall some key points:

- Cambria County, PA: I think it's in the west-central part of Pennsylvania. It's near Johnstown, PA.

- Cattaraugus County, NY: This is in western New York, south of Buffalo. It borders Pennsylvania.

Since they're close to each other, I need to be precise about their positions.

I should find the approximate longitudes of both counties. Longitude is measured in degrees west of the Prime Meridian. The more negative the longitude, the further west it is (for locations in the US).

In the US, longitudes are typically west, so they are negative values when expressed in decimal degrees, like -75° or -78°.

Let me try to find the longitude ranges.

First, for Cattaraugus County, NY:

Cattaraugus County is in the southwestern part of New York. Its western border is with Pennsylvania. Major towns include Olean and Salamanca.

The approximate longitude for Olean, NY, which is in Cattaraugus County, is around -78.43° W.

I should use coordinates.

I can think in terms of meridians.

The state border between PA and NY runs along the 42nd parallel north. But counties are within states.

Cattaraugus County, NY shares a border with Pennsylvania. Specifically, it borders McKean County, PA and Potter County, PA, I think.

Cambria County is not directly on the border; it's a bit east.

Let me list the counties.

Pennsylvania counties near the NY border:

- The northern tier of PA includes counties like Erie, Crawford, Warren, McKean, Potter, Tioga, etc.

Cambria County is south of these. Cambria is inland, west of Altoona, I believe.

I need a map or geographic reference.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I should use general knowledge.

I know that Cattaraugus County, NY is very close to the PA border. In fact, part of it is along the Allegheny River, which flows into Pennsylvania.

Cambria County, PA is centered around Johnstown, which is at approximately 78.92° W longitude? Let me think.

I can use known cities:

- Johnstown, PA is in Cambria County. Its coordinates are approximately 40.32° N, 78.92° W.

- For Cattaraugus County, let's take Olean, NY. Olean is at approximately 42.08° N, 78.43° W.

Longitude: Olean, NY is about 78.43° W, and Johnstown, PA is about 78.92° W.

78.92° W is more west than 78.43° W because higher numerical value in degrees west means further west.

Longitude degrees: as you go west, the number increases in the western hemisphere. For example, New York City is around 74° W, Chicago is around 87° W, so Chicago is west.

In decimal degrees, west longitudes are negative, but the magnitude increases west.

-78.92° W is equivalent to 78.92 degrees west.

Similarly, -78.43° W is 78.43 degrees west.

Since both are west, a larger number means further west.

So, 78.92° W vs. 78.43° W: 78.92 is larger than 78.43, so Johnstown at 78.92° W is west of Olean at 78.43° W.

But Johnstown is in Cambria County, PA, and Olean is in Cattaraugus County, NY.

Therefore, Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County?

That seems counterintuitive because Cattaraugus is in western NY, and Cambria is in central PA.

Let me confirm the coordinates.

I should double-check the longitudes.

Johnstown, PA: According to my memory, it's about 78.92° W. Let me think if that's accurate.

I can think of Pittsburgh, which is around 80° W, and Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh, so it should be less than 80.

Pittsburgh is about 79.99° W, roughly 80° W.

Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh, so its longitude should be less west, meaning smaller number.

Pitts
