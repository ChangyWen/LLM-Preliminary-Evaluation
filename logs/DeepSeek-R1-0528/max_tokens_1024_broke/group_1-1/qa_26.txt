*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: Is 98580, WA located west of 97233, OR? I need to figure out if the ZIP code 98580 in Washington state is west of the ZIP code 97233 in Oregon.

ZIP codes are used for mail delivery in the United States, and they can give a rough idea of location, but they're not precise for longitude comparisons. ZIP codes are assigned based on postal routes, not strictly geographic coordinates. However, for a general east-west comparison, I might be able to use the general location of these ZIP codes.

I should recall that ZIP codes in the US are numbered from east to west? No, that's not right. Actually, the first digit of the ZIP code represents a group of states, and it increases from the east coast to the west coast. For example, ZIP codes starting with 0 are in the Northeast, like Maine, and those starting with 9 are on the West Coast, like California, Oregon, Washington.

Let me check the first digits:

- 98580 starts with 9, so it's in the West Coast region.

- 97233 also starts with 9, so it's also in the West Coast region.

Both are in the 9s, which cover the western states. Specifically, Washington and Oregon are both part of the 9 group.

Now, within the 9 group, the numbering might have some geographic order. The second and third digits can indicate a sectional center facility (SCF), which might correspond to regions within the state.

I need to find the actual locations of these ZIP codes.

Since this is a reasoning process, I should think about the states and cities involved.

98580, WA: I believe this is for Aberdeen, Washington. I think Aberdeen is in Grays Harbor County, on the coast of Washington.

97233, OR: This is in Portland, Oregon. I know Portland ZIP codes start with 97, and 97233 is a specific one, probably in the northern part or something.

Let me confirm that.

First, 98580: Yes, ZIP code 98580 is assigned to Aberdeen, Washington. Aberdeen is on the Pacific coast, in the western part of Washington state.

Now, 97233: This is in Portland, Oregon. Portland is in the northwest part of Oregon, but it's inland, along the Columbia River.

To determine if Aberdeen is west of Portland, I need to compare their longitudes.

I should look up the approximate longitudes.

Since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on general knowledge.

Let me think about the geography.

Washington state is north of Oregon. Aberdeen is on the coast, so it's as far west as you can get in Washington, except for the Olympic Peninsula.

Portland is on the Columbia River, which separates Oregon from Washington. Portland is on the west side of Oregon, but not on the coast; the coast is further west.

Oregon's coast is to the west of Portland. For example, cities like Astoria or Seaside are on the coast, west of Portland.

Similarly, in Washington, Aberdeen is on the coast, so it should be west of most inland cities.

But Portland is not directly comparable because it's in a different state.

Let me think about longitudes.

I recall that Portland, Oregon, has a longitude of approximately 122.68° West.

Aberdeen, Washington: I think it's around 123.8° West or something. I need to be careful.

Longitudes are measured in degrees west from Greenwich. Higher numbers mean further west in the US since it's west of the prime meridian.

In the US, as you go west, longitude becomes more negative or higher in magnitude if we think of it as degrees west. Standard is to use negative for west, but often we just say degrees west.

For example:

- New York is around 74° W

- Chicago is around 87° W

- Denver is around 105° W

- San Francisco is around 122° W

- Seattle is around 122° W

Seattle is about 122.3° W, and Portland is similar since they're close.

Portland, OR: approximately 122.67° W

Now, Aberdeen, WA: Aberdeen is southwest of Seattle. Seattle is at about 122.33° W, and Aberdeen is on the coast, so it should be west of Seattle.

I think Aberdeen is around 123.8° W or so.

Let me think: the westernmost point in Washington is Cape Alava, around 124.7° W, but Aberdeen is not that far west.

Aberdeen is in Grays Harbor County. Grays Harbor is an inlet, and the city is on the coast.

I believe the longitude for Aberdeen is approximately 123.8° W.

Now, Portland, OR: let's confirm. Portland is at about 45.52° N, 122.68° W.

So longitude
