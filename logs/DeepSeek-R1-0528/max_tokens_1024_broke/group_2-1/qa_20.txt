First, the question is: "Is the atomic number of oxygen higher than that of carbon?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a yes or no answer.

The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It defines the element.

I know that carbon is an element with the symbol C. What's its atomic number? I think it's 6. Let me confirm that. Yes, carbon has 6 protons, so atomic number 6.

Oxygen is another element with the symbol O. Its atomic number should be 8. Oxygen has 8 protons.

So, comparing the two: carbon has atomic number 6, oxygen has atomic number 8. Therefore, oxygen has a higher atomic number than carbon.

I should make sure I have this right. Let me think about the periodic table. Elements are ordered by atomic number. Carbon comes before oxygen. Hydrogen is 1, helium is 2, lithium is 3, beryllium is 4, boron is 5, carbon is 6, nitrogen is 7, oxygen is 8. Yes, that's correct.

So, atomic number of carbon: 6

Atomic number of oxygen: 8

Since 8 is greater than 6, oxygen has a higher atomic number.

The question is specifically: "Is the atomic number of oxygen higher than that of carbon?" So, yes, it is higher.

I need to show step-by-step reasoning. So, I should write it out clearly.

Step 1: Recall the definition of atomic number. Atomic number is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus.

Step 2: Identify the atomic number of carbon. Carbon has an atomic number of 6.

Step 3: Identify the atomic number of oxygen. Oxygen has an atomic number of 8.

Step 4: Compare the two atomic numbers. 8 is greater than 6.

Therefore, yes, the atomic number of oxygen is higher than that of carbon.

Final answer: Yes.

The question says to end with "Yes or No", so I should box that or make it clear.

Also, since this is a reasoning process, I should be precise.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

1. **Understand atomic number**: The atomic number of an element is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is a unique identifier for each element and determines its position in the periodic table.

2. **Recall the atomic number of carbon**:  
   - Carbon is a chemical element with the symbol C.  
   - Its atomic number is 6, as it has 6 protons in its nucleus.  
   - This is a standard value from the periodic table.

3. **Recall the atomic number of oxygen**:  
   - Oxygen is a chemical element with the symbol O.  
   - Its atomic number is 8, as it has 8 protons in its nucleus.  
   - This is also a standard value from the periodic table.

4. **Compare the atomic numbers**:  
   - Atomic number of carbon: 6  
   - Atomic number of oxygen: 8  
   - Since 8 is greater than 6, the atomic number of oxygen is higher than that of carbon.

**Final Answer**: Yes
