*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is a blue whale heavier than an elephant?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I should recall the average weights of both animals. I know that blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, so they should be heavier than elephants, which are the largest land animals.

Let me start with the blue whale. From what I remember, adult blue whales can weigh up to 200 tons or more. But I should use more precise figures. I think the average weight for a blue whale is around 100 to 150 metric tons. Let me confirm that.

Actually, upon second thought, blue whales can weigh between 100 and 150 tons, but some sources say up to 180 tons. I'll go with a standard average. Let's say 140 metric tons for a large adult. But I should use kilograms or tons consistently.

Since the question is about weight, I can use metric tons to make it easier. One metric ton is 1,000 kilograms.

Now, for elephants. There are two main species: African elephants and Asian elephants. African elephants are larger. An adult male African elephant can weigh up to 6,000 to 7,000 kilograms. That's about 6 to 7 metric tons. Asian elephants are smaller, around 3,000 to 5,000 kilograms or 3 to 5 metric tons.

Since the blue whale is much larger, even the largest elephant should be lighter than the smallest adult blue whale.

Let me get some specific numbers.

For blue whales:

- Average length: 25-30 meters

- Average weight: 100-120 metric tons for females, males a bit less, but still huge.

I think the maximum recorded weight for a blue whale is about 173 metric tons, but commonly, they are around 100-150 tons.

Let's use 100 metric tons as a conservative estimate. That's 100,000 kilograms.

For elephants:

- African bush elephant: males weigh 4,500 to 6,800 kg (average about 6,000 kg)

- African forest elephant: smaller, but still around 2,000 to 4,000 kg

- Asian elephant: 2,500 to 5,500 kg for males

So, the heaviest elephant, an African bush elephant, might be up to 7,000 kg or 7 metric tons.

Now, comparing:

Blue whale: minimum adult weight, say 80 metric tons (80,000 kg) to be safe.

Elephant: maximum, 7 metric tons (7,000 kg).

80 tons vs. 7 tons. 80 is much larger than 7.

Even if I take a small blue whale at 80 tons and a large elephant at 7 tons, the blue whale is over 11 times heavier.

To be thorough, let's find reliable sources in my knowledge.

I recall that blue whales weigh about 200,000 pounds or more. Let's convert that.

1 metric ton = 2,204.62 pounds.

But sometimes people use short tons, which are 2,000 pounds.

To avoid confusion, I'll stick with metric.

Blue whale: average weight 100,000 to 150,000 kg (100 to 150 metric tons)

Elephant: African elephant up to 6,000 to 7,000 kg (6 to 7 metric tons)

So, 100,000 kg vs. 7,000 kg, blue whale is heavier.

What about the largest recorded?

- Heaviest blue whale recorded: 190 tonnes (190,000 kg) but that's disputed; commonly accepted is up to 173 tonnes.

- Heaviest elephant: about 10,000 kg (10 metric tons) for a very large African elephant, but that's rare. Most sources say max 7,000 to 8,000 kg.

Still, 173,000 kg vs. 10,000 kg is 17 times heavier.

So, in all cases, a blue whale is heavier than an elephant.

Is there any elephant that could be heavier? No, because even the prehistoric mammoths were only about 6 to 8 tons, similar to modern elephants. Blue whales are in a different league.

Therefore, yes, a blue whale is heavier than an elephant.

Final answer should be Yes.

But let me make sure there's no trick. For example, a baby blue whale vs. an adult elephant? But the question says "a blue whale" and "an elephant," implying typical adults, I think. In common parlance, we compare the species averages.

The question doesn't specify, but it's reasonable to assume adult animals.

Even a newborn blue whale is about 2,700 kg (2.7 tons), which is lighter than a large elephant, but that's not what is meant. The question is about the animals in general, so adults.

In wildlife contexts, when we say
