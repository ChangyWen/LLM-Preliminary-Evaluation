First, the question is: "Is the boiling point of water higher than the freezing point of water?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius and boils at 100 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. That's basic science.

The freezing point is when water turns into ice, and the boiling point is when it turns into steam. So, 0°C for freezing and 100°C for boiling.

Comparing the two: 100°C is greater than 0°C, so yes, the boiling point is higher.

But let me make sure about the units. The question doesn't specify Celsius or Fahrenheit, but in science, we often use Celsius. In Fahrenheit, freezing is 32°F and boiling is 212°F. Still, 212 is higher than 32, so the boiling point is still higher.

In Kelvin, freezing is 273 K and boiling is 373 K. Again, 373 > 273.

So, no matter which scale, the boiling point is higher than the freezing point.

Is there any condition where this might not be true? For example, under different pressures. But the question doesn't mention any specific conditions, so I think we assume standard conditions.

Standard atmospheric pressure is 1 atm, where water freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C.

Also, for pure water, not saltwater or anything. But again, the question just says "water," so I think it's pure water.

So, step by step:

1. Identify the freezing point of water: 0°C (or 32°F, 273 K).

2. Identify the boiling point of water: 100°C (or 212°F, 373 K).

3. Compare the two: 100 > 0, so boiling point is higher.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The question asks for a final answer of Yes or No, so I need to box that.

Reasoning process: I've outlined it above.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Understand the properties of water**: Water has a specific freezing point and boiling point under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm). These points are well-established in physical science.

2. **Recall the freezing point of water**: The freezing point is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a solid (ice). For pure water at standard pressure, this is:
   - 0 degrees Celsius (°C)
   - 32 degrees Fahrenheit (°F)
   - 273 Kelvin (K)

3. **Recall the boiling point of water**: The boiling point is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a gas (steam). For pure water at standard pressure, this is:
   - 100 degrees Celsius (°C)
   - 212 degrees Fahrenheit (°F)
   - 373 Kelvin (K)

4. **Compare the values numerically**:
   - In Celsius: 100 °C > 0 °C
   - In Fahrenheit: 212 °F > 32 °F
   - In Kelvin: 373 K > 273 K

5. **Consider any potential exceptions**: The comparison holds under standard conditions (pure water, 1 atm pressure). Variations in pressure or impurities (like salt) can shift these points, but the question does not specify such conditions, so we assume standard reference points. Even under non-standard conditions, the boiling point remains higher than the freezing point for water.

6. **Conclusion**: Since the boiling point (100 °C) is numerically greater than the freezing point (0 °C) in all common temperature scales, the boiling point of water is higher than the freezing point.

**Final Answer: Yes**
