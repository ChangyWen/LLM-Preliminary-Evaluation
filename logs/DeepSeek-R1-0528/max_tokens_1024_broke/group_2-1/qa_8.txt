*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the Sahara Desert hotter than the Gobi Desert?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the Sahara Desert is in Africa, and it's the largest hot desert in the world. The Gobi Desert is in Asia, covering parts of northern China and southern Mongolia. The Gobi is a cold desert, meaning it can have very cold winters, but it can also get hot in summer.

Now, to compare their temperatures, I should look at average temperatures or typical temperature ranges for both deserts. I recall that the Sahara is known for extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 50°C (122°F) in summer. The Gobi, being a cold desert, has more extreme temperature variations; it can be very hot in summer but freezing in winter.

But the question is about which one is hotter. I need to clarify if this means on average, or at peak times. I think for such comparisons, we often look at average annual temperatures or summer highs.

Let me think about average annual temperatures. The Sahara has a high average temperature because it's consistently warm to hot year-round. For example, average highs in the Sahara can be around 30-40°C (86-104°F) in summer, and it rarely gets cold. In winter, it might cool down but still be relatively warm compared to other places.

The Gobi has a continental climate with hot summers and very cold winters. Summer temperatures can reach up to 40°C (104°F), but winter temperatures can drop to -40°C (-40°F) or lower. So the annual average might be lower due to the cold winters.

I should look for specific data. Since I don't have real-time access, I'll rely on general knowledge from geography.

I remember that the Sahara is often cited as one of the hottest places on Earth. For instance, places like Death Valley are extremely hot, but Death Valley is in the US, not Sahara. Still, Sahara has recorded high temperatures.

The highest temperature ever recorded on Earth was in Furnace Creek, Death Valley, at 56.7°C (134°F), but that's not Sahara. In Sahara, I think it's around 55°C (131°F) in some areas.

For Gobi, the highest temperatures might be lower. I think Gobi summer highs are around 40-45°C (104-113°F), but not as high as Sahara.

Also, for average temperatures: Let's find some numbers.

Typical average annual temperature for Sahara: I think it's around 25-30°C (77-86°F) in many parts.

For Gobi, due to cold winters, the average annual temperature is lower. I recall it might be around 2-8°C (36-46°F) or something like that. That seems too low; let me think.

For example, Ulaanbaatar, which is near the Gobi, is often called the coldest capital city, but it's not in the desert. The Gobi desert itself has an average annual temperature that varies.

Upon recollection, the Gobi Desert has an average annual temperature of about -2 to 5°C (28-41°F) depending on the region. That can't be right for average; I think I'm confusing it.

Let me think differently. I should compare summer temperatures since that's when deserts are hottest.

Peak summer temperatures:

- Sahara: Average high in summer (July) can be 38-46°C (100-115°F), with extremes above 50°C.

- Gobi: Average high in summer (July) around 31-38°C (88-100°F), with extremes up to 45°C in some areas.

But Sahara seems hotter.

I found a source in my memory: The Sahara has mean annual temperatures around 30°C (86°F), while the Gobi has mean annual temperatures around 2.5°C (36.5°F). That seems like a big difference.

For instance, in the Gobi, the temperature can vary from -40°C in winter to 45°C in summer, so the average would be low. In Sahara, winter lows might be 10-20°C, and summer highs 40-50°C, so average higher.

Therefore, overall, the Sahara is hotter on average.

But the question might be interpreted as which one has higher maximum temperatures. I think both can have high max temps, but Sahara is generally hotter.

Let's see what reliable sources say. Since I'm an AI, I can access internal knowledge.

Based on general knowledge:

- The Sahara Desert: Known for extreme heat, with average summer temperatures around 38°C (100°F) and can exceed 50°C (122°F). The annual average temperature is high,
