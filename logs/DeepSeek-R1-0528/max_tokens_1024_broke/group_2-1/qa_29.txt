First, the question is: "Is the wavelength of red light longer than that of blue light?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I recall that light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. Visible light ranges from about 380 nanometers (nm) to 750 nm.

Specifically, red light has the longest wavelengths in the visible spectrum, and blue light has shorter wavelengths. Violet and blue are on the shorter end, while red is on the longer end.

Let me confirm the typical wavelength ranges:

- Red light: approximately 620-750 nm

- Blue light: approximately 450-495 nm

Comparing these, red light wavelengths are higher than blue light wavelengths. For example, 620 nm is greater than 495 nm, and 750 nm is much larger than 450 nm. So, yes, red light has longer wavelengths.

I remember that frequency and wavelength are inversely related by the speed of light: c = λν, where c is the speed of light, λ is wavelength, and ν is frequency. Since c is constant, if wavelength is longer, frequency is lower.

Red light has a lower frequency than blue light, which means red light has a longer wavelength.

In terms of the visible spectrum order: it's often remembered by the acronym ROYGBIV: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. Red has the longest wavelength, and violet the shortest.

Blue is before indigo and violet, so it has shorter wavelengths than green, yellow, orange, and red.

So, red should have the longest wavelength among visible colors.

Therefore, the wavelength of red light is longer than that of blue light.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question asks for step-by-step reasoning and then the final answer.

So, step-by-step:

1. Light is an electromagnetic wave with a spectrum of wavelengths.

2. Visible light wavelengths range from about 380 nm (violet) to 750 nm (red).

3. Specifically, blue light has wavelengths around 450-495 nm.

4. Red light has wavelengths around 620-750 nm.

5. Since 620-750 nm is greater than 450-495 nm, red light has longer wavelengths than blue light.

6. Alternatively, in the electromagnetic spectrum, longer wavelengths correspond to red, and shorter to blue.

Thus, the wavelength of red light is longer than that of blue light.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Light and Wavelength**:  
   - Light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and visible light consists of different colors, each corresponding to a specific range of wavelengths.  
   - Wavelength (λ) is the distance between consecutive peaks of a wave, measured in nanometers (nm).  

2. **Visible Light Spectrum Ranges**:  
   - The visible spectrum ranges from approximately 380 nm (violet, shortest wavelength) to 750 nm (red, longest wavelength).  
   - Key color ranges:  
     - **Red light**: Approximately 620–750 nm.  
     - **Blue light**: Approximately 450–495 nm.  

3. **Comparison of Red and Blue Light Wavelengths**:  
   - The minimum wavelength for red light (620 nm) is greater than the maximum wavelength for blue light (495 nm).  
   - Even within their ranges:  
     - The shortest red light (620 nm) is longer than the longest blue light (495 nm).  
     - The average wavelength for red light (e.g., around 700 nm) is significantly longer than for blue light (e.g., around 475 nm).  

4. **General Principle of the Spectrum**:  
   - In the visible light sequence (often remembered as ROYGBIV: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet), red has the longest wavelengths, and blue/violet have shorter wavelengths.  
   - This is consistent with the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency (since speed of light is constant: \( c = \lambda \nu \)). Red light has lower frequency, confirming longer wavelength.  

5. **Conclusion from Comparison**:  
   - Since all values in the red light range (620–750 nm) are greater than all values in the blue light range (450–495 nm), the wavelength of red light is longer than that of blue light.  

**Final Answer: Yes**
