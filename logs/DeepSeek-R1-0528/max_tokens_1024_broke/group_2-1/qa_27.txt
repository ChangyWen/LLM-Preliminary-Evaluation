*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the melting point of ice lower than the boiling point of water?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the melting point of ice is the temperature at which ice turns into water. For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, that's 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

The boiling point of water is the temperature at which water turns into steam. At standard atmospheric pressure, that's 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

So, comparing 0 degrees Celsius to 100 degrees Celsius, 0 is less than 100. That means the melting point is lower than the boiling point.

I should confirm the units. The question doesn't specify units, but in science, we usually use Celsius for such comparisons. Even if I use Kelvin, where melting point is 273 K and boiling point is 373 K, 273 is still less than 373.

Fahrenheit: melting point is 32°F, boiling point is 212°F, and 32 is less than 212.

So, in all common temperature scales, the melting point of ice is lower than the boiling point of water.

Is there any condition where this might not be true? For example, if pressure changes. At higher pressures, the melting point of ice decreases slightly for very high pressures, but the boiling point increases. However, under standard conditions, which I think the question implies, it's straightforward.

The question says "ice" and "water," which typically refer to the common substances under normal conditions. So, I shouldn't overcomplicate it.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The melting point of ice is the temperature at which solid water (ice) transitions to liquid water.

2. For pure water at 1 atmosphere pressure, this temperature is 0°C.

3. The boiling point of water is the temperature at which liquid water transitions to water vapor (steam).

4. At 1 atmosphere pressure, this temperature is 100°C.

5. Comparing 0°C and 100°C, 0 is less than 100.

6. Therefore, the melting point of ice is lower than the boiling point of water.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)." So, I need to present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the terms:**
   - The **melting point of ice** is the temperature at which solid ice turns into liquid water.
   - The **boiling point of water** is the temperature at which liquid water turns into water vapor (steam).

2. **Recall standard values:**
   - Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.3 kPa), the melting point of ice for pure water is **0°C (32°F)**.
   - Under the same conditions, the boiling point of water is **100°C (212°F)**.

3. **Compare the temperatures:**
   - In Celsius: 0°C (melting point) vs. 100°C (boiling point). Since 0 is less than 100, the melting point is lower.
   - In Fahrenheit: 32°F (melting point) vs. 212°F (boiling point). Since 32 is less than 212, the melting point is lower.
   - In Kelvin (for completeness): Melting point is 273 K, boiling point is 373 K. Since 273 is less than 373, the melting point is lower.

4. **Consider any potential variations:**
   - The values above are for pure water at standard pressure, which is the typical context for such questions. Pressure changes can affect both points (e.g., higher pressure raises boiling point and slightly lowers melting point under extreme conditions), but this does not reverse the relationship under normal conditions.
   - Impurities can alter melting and boiling points, but the question refers to "ice" and "water" in a general sense, implying pure substances.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since 0°C < 100°C (or equivalent in other units), the melting point of ice is consistently lower than the boiling point of water under standard conditions.

**Final Answer: Yes**
