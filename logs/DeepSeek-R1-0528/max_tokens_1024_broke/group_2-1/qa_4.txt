*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Does the United States have a larger population than Canada?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the United States is a country in North America, and Canada is also in North America, right above the US. I remember that the US has a lot more people than Canada, but I should confirm the actual numbers.

I need to recall the current populations or find reliable data. Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll use general knowledge or approximate figures.

From what I know, the population of the United States is around 331 million people. I think that's the figure from recent years, like 2020 or 2021. Let me think: in 2020, it was about 331 million, and it might have grown a bit, but I'll use that as a reference.

For Canada, I think it's around 38 million. I remember it being close to 40 million, but let's say 38 million for now. I should be precise.

I can think about the land area too. Canada is larger in area than the US, but it has a smaller population because much of it is very cold and not densely populated.

But I need population numbers specifically.

Let me recall: according to the United States Census Bureau, the US population in 2023 was approximately 334 million. I think it's around that.

For Canada, Statistics Canada reported a population of about 40 million in 2023 or 2024? I think it was 39 million in 2022, and it might have reached 40 million recently.

I should use consistent data. Let's assume we're talking about the present or recent past.

Since this is a simple comparison, I can use well-known facts.

I know that the US population is about 10 times that of Canada. For example, 330 million vs 38 million, which is roughly 8.7 times, but still, 330 is way bigger than 38.

38 million? I think Canada's population is higher. Let me double-check my memory.

I recall that in 2021, Canada's population was about 38 million, and the US was 331 million. In 2023, Canada might be around 39-40 million, and the US around 335-340 million.

But even with 40 million for Canada and 340 million for the US, 340 > 40, so yes, the US has a larger population.

To be thorough, I can look for official sources, but since I'm an AI, I have access to general knowledge.

Based on World Bank data or similar:

- United States population in 2022: 333.3 million (I think)

- Canada population in 2022: 38.9 million

Yes, that sounds right.

So, 333.3 million vs 38.9 million.

Clearly, 333.3 > 38.9, so the US has a larger population.

I could also consider the population density: US has about 36 people per square kilometer, while Canada has about 4 people per square kilometer, which shows that Canada has fewer people despite being larger in area.

But for this question, just comparing the total populations is sufficient.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall the approximate population of the United States. From memory, it is over 330 million as of recent years.

2. Recall the approximate population of Canada. From memory, it is under 40 million as of recent years.

3. Compare the two numbers: 330 million is greater than 40 million.

4. Therefore, the United States has a larger population than Canada.

To be more precise:

- As of 2023, US population: approximately 334 million (source: U.S. Census Bureau)

- As of 2023, Canada population: approximately 40 million (source: Statistics Canada)

334 million > 40 million, so yes.

Even if I use older data, like 2020:

- US: 331 million

- Canada: 38 million

331 > 38.

No matter what, the US population is significantly larger.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

So, I need to present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the question**: The question asks whether the United States has a larger population than Canada. I need to compare the total population figures of both countries and provide a clear answer.

2. **Recall recent population data**: To answer accurately, I should use the most recent and reliable population estimates. Based on official sources:
   - For the United States, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the population as of July 1, 2023, to be approximately **339.7 million** (source: [U.S. Census Bureau, 2023 Population Estimate
