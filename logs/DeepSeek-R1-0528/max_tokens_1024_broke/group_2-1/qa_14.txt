*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Does a blue whale have a larger heart than an elephant?" I need to show step-by-step reasoning and end with a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, and elephants are the largest land animals. So, it makes sense that a blue whale's heart would be larger, but I should confirm with facts.

Let me recall some key facts:

- Blue whales can grow up to about 100 feet (30 meters) long and weigh up to 200 tons (approximately 180,000 kg).

- Elephants, specifically African elephants, are the largest land animals. They can weigh up to 6,000 kg for males.

Now, about their hearts:

- I remember that a blue whale's heart is enormous. I think it's about the size of a small car. I've heard that it weighs around 400 pounds (180 kg) and is big enough for a human to swim through the arteries, but that might be an exaggeration. Let me think accurately.

- For elephants, an adult elephant's heart weighs around 12 to 21 kg (26 to 46 pounds). I think I've read that somewhere.

I should look for reliable sources in my knowledge. Since I can't access the internet, I'll use general knowledge.

Step 1: Compare the sizes of the animals.

- Blue whale: Average weight is about 100-150 tons, but up to 200 tons. Let's use 150,000 kg for simplicity.

- Elephant: African elephant, up to 6,000 kg for large males.

So, a blue whale is about 25 times heavier than an elephant (150,000 / 6,000 = 25). That's a huge difference.

Step 2: Heart size relative to body size.

Hearts don't scale linearly with body size, but in large animals, they are still proportional to some degree.

For mammals, heart weight is roughly proportional to body weight. The average heart weight to body weight ratio is about 0.6% for mammals. But this can vary.

- For humans, heart weight is about 0.4% to 0.5% of body weight. A 70 kg person has a heart around 300 grams, so 0.43%.

- For larger animals, it might be different.

I think for elephants, the heart is about 0.5% of body weight.

Let me estimate:

- Elephant body weight: 5,000 kg (average large male)

- Heart weight: I think it's around 20 kg. 20 kg / 5,000 kg = 0.4%, which is similar to humans.

Now for blue whales:

- Body weight: 150,000 kg

- If heart weight were 0.4%, that would be 600 kg. But I think it's larger.

I recall specific facts:

- Blue whale heart: I think it weighs about 400 kg or more? No, I remember it being around 180 kg.

Upon second thought, I think a blue whale's heart weighs about 130 to 180 kg. Let's say 150 kg.

- Sources: I've read that it can be up to 1,000 pounds, which is about 450 kg, but I think that's for the largest whales.

Let's clarify:

A reliable fact: The average blue whale heart weighs about 400 pounds, which is 181 kg. I think that's standard.

Similarly, for elephants, an African elephant's heart weighs about 12 to 21 kg. Let's take 20 kg as a round number.

So, comparing:

- Blue whale heart: ~180 kg

- Elephant heart: ~20 kg

180 kg vs 20 kg, so blue whale heart is much larger.

But is this accurate? Let me double-check my memory.

I think I should consider the largest recorded or typical sizes.

Step 3: Specific data points.

For blue whales:

- According to the American Museum of Natural History or similar, a blue whale's heart is about the size of a small car, weighing up to 1,000 pounds (454 kg), but I think that's an upper estimate. More commonly, it's said to be 400-600 pounds.

- 400 pounds is 181 kg, 600 pounds is 272 kg.

But I found online (in past knowledge) that it's approximately 180 kg.

For elephants:

- The heart of an adult African elephant weighs between 12 and 21 kg. Source: various wildlife documentaries or biology texts.

- For example, a 5,000 kg elephant might have a 20 kg heart.

Now, ratio-wise:

Elephant heart to body weight: 20 kg / 5,000 kg = 0.4%

Blue whale: If heart is 180 kg, body 150,000 kg, ratio = 180 / 150,000 = 0.12%
