*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Russia larger in area than Australia?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Russia is the largest country in the world by land area, and Australia is also a very large country, but I'm not sure if it's bigger than Russia. I should recall the actual areas.

Let me think about the approximate land areas:

- Russia has an area of about 17 million square kilometers.

- Australia has an area of about 7.7 million square kilometers. I think Australia is around that size, but let me confirm.

I remember that Russia spans across Europe and Asia, covering a huge portion of the Earth's land. Australia is a continent-country, but it's mostly desert and not as vast as Russia.

To be precise, I should look up the exact figures, but since this is a reasoning process, I can use general knowledge.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the land area of Russia: According to sources, Russia's total area is approximately 17,098,242 square kilometers. That's about 17.1 million km².

2. Identify the land area of Australia: Australia's area is about 7,692,024 square kilometers or 7.7 million km². That includes the mainland and islands, but not external territories for standard comparison.

3. Compare the two numbers: 17.1 million vs. 7.7 million. Clearly, 17.1 is more than twice as large as 7.7.

4. Therefore, Russia is larger than Australia in terms of land area.

I should also consider if there's any trick, like including territorial waters or something, but the question says "area," which typically means land area for country size comparisons. Both figures are standard land areas.

Just to be thorough:

- Russia: 17.1 million km²

- Australia: 7.7 million km²

Yes, 17.1 > 7.7, so Russia is larger.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question asks to show step-by-step reasoning and then the final answer.

So, my reasoning:

- Step 1: Recall that Russia is the largest country by land area.

- Step 2: Recall that Australia is the sixth-largest country, after Russia, Canada, China, USA, and Brazil. I think that's the order.

- Step 3: Since Russia is first and Australia is sixth, Russia must be larger.

But to be more precise:

- Step 1: Russia's land area is approximately 17.1 million square kilometers.

- Step 2: Australia's land area is approximately 7.7 million square kilometers.

- Step 3: Since 17.1 million > 7.7 million, Russia has a larger area than Australia.

Therefore, the answer is Yes.

I think that's solid.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the question**: The question is whether Russia is larger in area than Australia. "Area" here refers to land area, as is standard for comparing country sizes.

2. **Recall the land area of Russia**: Russia is the largest country in the world by land area. According to authoritative sources like the CIA World Factbook or the United Nations, Russia's total land area is approximately **17,098,246 square kilometers** (or about 17.1 million km²). This includes land only, not territorial waters.

3. **Recall the land area of Australia**: Australia is also a large country, but it is not as big as Russia. Australia's land area is approximately **7,692,024 square kilometers** (or about 7.7 million km²), making it the sixth-largest country in the world. This figure includes the Australian mainland and major islands like Tasmania.

4. **Compare the areas**:  
   - Russia: ~17,098,246 km²  
   - Australia: ~7,692,024 km²  
   To compare:  
   - 17,098,246 km² (Russia) > 7,692,024 km² (Australia)  
   - The difference is substantial: Russia is more than twice as large as Australia (specifically, about 2.22 times larger).

5. **Consider any nuances**:  
   - Both figures are for total land area, excluding exclusive economic zones or maritime claims, which is the standard for such comparisons.  
   - Russia's size includes its vast territory across Europe and Asia, while Australia is a single continent-country.  
   - Based on global rankings, Russia is consistently ranked 1st in area, while Australia is 6th, confirming that Russia is larger.

6. **Conclusion**: Since Russia's land area is significantly greater than Australia's, the answer is yes.

**Final Answer: Yes**
