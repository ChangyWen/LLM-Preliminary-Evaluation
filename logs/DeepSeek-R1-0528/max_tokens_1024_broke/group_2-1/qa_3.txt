*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Did Albert Einstein die later than Isaac Newton?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a "Yes" or "No" answer.

I need to recall the death dates of both Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton.

Starting with Isaac Newton: He was born on January 4, 1643, and died on March 31, 1727. I should confirm this. Yes, Newton died in 1727.

Now, Albert Einstein: He was born on March 14, 1879, and died on April 18, 1955.

So, Newton died in 1727, and Einstein died in 1955.

Comparing the years: 1955 is much later than 1727. 1955 minus 1727 is 228 years later, so yes, Einstein died after Newton.

I should make sure about the dates. Is there any chance I have the wrong death years?

- Isaac Newton: Died March 31, 1727. That's standard historical knowledge.

- Albert Einstein: Died April 18, 1955. Also standard.

No controversy here; both are well-documented.

The question is about who died later, meaning who has the more recent death date. Since 1955 is after 1727, Einstein died later.

But let's be precise: "Die later than" means that the death occurred at a later point in time. So, 1955 is later than 1727, so Einstein died later than Newton.

I should consider if there's any time zone or calendar issue, but both dates are in the Gregorian calendar, and we're dealing with years far apart, so no issue.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the death year of Isaac Newton: 1727.

2. Identify the death year of Albert Einstein: 1955.

3. Compare the years: 1955 > 1727, meaning 1955 is later than 1727.

4. Therefore, Albert Einstein died later than Isaac Newton.

Final answer should be "Yes".

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

So, I'll write it out clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Isaac Newton's death date:**
   - Isaac Newton was a renowned physicist and mathematician.
   - He died on March 31, 1727.
   - Source: Historical records confirm this date, as Newton lived from January 4, 1643, to March 31, 1727.

2. **Identify Albert Einstein's death date:**
   - Albert Einstein was a famous theoretical physicist.
   - He died on April 18, 1955.
   - Source: Historical records confirm this date, as Einstein lived from March 14, 1879, to April 18, 1955.

3. **Compare the death years:**
   - Newton died in 1727.
   - Einstein died in 1955.
   - Since 1955 is numerically greater than 1727, 1955 comes after 1727 in the Gregorian calendar.

4. **Determine the temporal order:**
   - 1955 is 228 years after 1727, so Einstein's death occurred much later than Newton's.
   - Therefore, Albert Einstein died later than Isaac Newton.

**Final Answer:** Yes
