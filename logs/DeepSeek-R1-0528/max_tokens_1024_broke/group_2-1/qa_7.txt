*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is a cheetah faster than a lion?" I need to provide a step-by-step reasoning process and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I recall that cheetahs are known for being the fastest land animals. They can run very fast in short bursts. Lions are also fast, but I think cheetahs are faster.

Let me think about the top speeds:

- Cheetahs can reach speeds up to 60-70 miles per hour (mph) or about 97-113 kilometers per hour (km/h). I think the commonly cited top speed is around 70 mph.

- Lions, on the other hand, can run up to 50 mph or 80 km/h. I'm not entirely sure, but I think it's less than cheetahs.

I should confirm these facts. Based on general knowledge:

- Cheetahs are built for speed with their lightweight bodies, long legs, and flexible spine. They can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just a few seconds.

- Lions are powerful but not as fast. They rely more on strength and ambush rather than pure speed.

Now, to be thorough, let's look for specific numbers:

- According to various sources like National Geographic or wildlife documentaries, cheetahs can run at 70-75 mph (112-120 km/h).

- Lions can run at about 50 mph (80 km/h).

So, comparing 70 mph to 50 mph, the cheetah is faster.

But I should make sure about the units. The question doesn't specify, but speed is speed, so as long as I'm consistent, it should be fine.

Also, I need to consider if there's any context, like over a long distance or short sprint. Cheetahs are sprinters, meaning they are faster over short distances but tire quickly. Lions might sustain their speed longer, but for top speed, cheetahs are unmatched.

The question is straightforward: "faster" likely means higher top speed.

Final answer should be Yes.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the key attribute: speed, specifically top speed.

2. Recall biological facts: Cheetahs are adapted for high-speed chases.

3. Research from memory: Cheetah top speed is approximately 70 mph, lion top speed is approximately 50 mph.

4. Compare: 70 mph > 50 mph, so cheetah is faster.

5. Conclude: Yes, a cheetah is faster than a lion.

Since I'm an AI, I should base this on reliable knowledge, not personal opinion.

To be precise:

- Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus): Top speed recorded up to 75 mph (120 km/h) in short bursts.

- Lion (Panthera leo): Top speed around 50 mph (80 km/h).

Sources: I can think of the Guinness World Records or scientific studies. For example, cheetahs are listed as the fastest land animal.

Therefore, the answer is clear.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether a cheetah is faster than a lion. "Faster" typically refers to top speed in a sprint, as both animals are known for short bursts of speed rather than endurance running.

2. **Recall Key Biological Facts**:
   - Cheetahs are built for speed: They have a lightweight frame, long legs, a flexible spine, and specialized muscles that allow for rapid acceleration. This makes them the fastest land animals over short distances.
   - Lions are powerful predators: They are strong and can run quickly, but their build is more suited for strength and ambush hunting rather than pure speed.

3. **Compare Top Speeds**:
   - According to scientific data and reputable sources like National Geographic, the Guinness World Records, and the African Wildlife Foundation:
     - **Cheetah top speed**: 60–75 mph (97–121 km/h). The most commonly accepted figure is around 70 mph (113 km/h) in short bursts of 20–30 seconds.
     - **Lion top speed**: 50 mph (80 km/h) in short bursts, with sustained speeds usually lower (around 35–40 mph or 56–64 km/h) due to their heavier build.
   - This shows that the cheetah's top speed is significantly higher than the lion's.

4. **Consider Context**:
   - Speed can depend on distance: Cheetahs excel in sprints (up to 500 meters) but tire quickly, while lions can maintain their top speed for slightly longer distances. However, the question focuses on raw speed, not endurance.
   - Real-world hunting: Cheetahs rely on their speed to catch prey like gazelles, while lions use teamwork and strength to ambush larger prey. This reinforces that cheetahs are evolutionarily optimized for higher speeds.

5. **Conclusion from Comparison**: Since
