*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the speed of light faster than the speed of sound?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the speed of light is a fundamental constant in physics. In a vacuum, it's approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. That's about 3.00 × 10^8 m/s.

The speed of sound depends on the medium it's traveling through. In air, at room temperature and sea level, it's about 343 meters per second. That's roughly 3.43 × 10^2 m/s.

Now, comparing these two values: 3.00 × 10^8 m/s vs. 3.43 × 10^2 m/s.

To make it clear, I can think in terms of orders of magnitude. The speed of light is on the order of 10^8 m/s, and the speed of sound is on the order of 10^2 m/s. So, 10^8 is much larger than 10^2; it's 10,000 times larger, since 10^8 / 10^2 = 10^6, which is 1,000,000. So light is about a million times faster than sound in air.

But the question doesn't specify the medium. Speed of light is fastest in vacuum and slower in other media, but even in materials like water or glass, it's still much faster than sound. For example, in water, speed of light is about 2.25 × 10^8 m/s, while speed of sound is about 1,480 m/s, so still about 150,000 times faster.

Speed of sound in solids can be higher; for instance, in steel, it's around 5,960 m/s. But even then, compared to speed of light in vacuum (3e8 m/s), it's still 3e8 / 5960 ≈ 50,000 times faster. And light in materials is slower but still way faster; e.g., in diamond, light is about 1.24e8 m/s, sound is about 12,000 m/s, so about 10,000 times faster.

So in all practical cases, light is much faster than sound.

I should also consider if there's any scenario where sound could be faster, but I don't think so. Sound is a mechanical wave that requires a medium, and its speed is limited by the properties of that medium, while light is an electromagnetic wave that doesn't require a medium and has a universal speed limit in vacuum.

The speed of light in vacuum is the ultimate speed limit according to relativity, and nothing can travel faster than that.

Therefore, under all normal conditions, the speed of light is greater than the speed of sound.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "show step-by-step reasoning," so I need to outline this clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the question**: The question asks whether the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound. This requires comparing their respective speeds.

2. **Recall the speed of light**:
   - The speed of light in a vacuum is a fundamental constant of nature.
   - It is approximately \( 299,792,458 \) meters per second (m/s), which is often rounded to \( 3.00 \times 10^8 \) m/s for simplicity.
   - Even in other media (like air, water, or glass), the speed of light is slower but still extremely fast. For example:
     - In air: About \( 3.00 \times 10^8 \) m/s (very close to vacuum).
     - In water: About \( 2.25 \times 10^8 \) m/s.
     - In glass: About \( 2.00 \times 10^8 \) m/s.

3. **Recall the speed of sound**:
   - The speed of sound is not a constant; it depends on the medium (e.g., air, water, or solid materials) and factors like temperature, pressure, and density.
   - In standard conditions (dry air at 20°C and sea level), the speed of sound is approximately \( 343 \) m/s, or about \( 3.43 \times 10^2 \) m/s.
   - In other media:
     - In water: About \( 1,480 \) m/s.
     - In steel (a solid): About \( 5,960 \) m/s.

4. **Compare the speeds**:
   - Compare the speed of light in a vacuum (\( 3.00 \times 10^8 \) m/s) to the speed of sound in air (\( 3.43 \times 10^2 \) m/s):
     - \( 3.00 \times 10^8 \) ÷ \( 3.43 \times
