*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are comparing the pH of lemon juice and water.
 Recall that pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with lower numbers indicating higher acidity and higher numbers indicating higher basicity. A pH of 7 is neutral.

 Step 1: Identify the typical pH of water.
 - Pure water at 25°C has a pH of 7 (neutral).

 Step 2: Identify the typical pH of lemon juice.
 - Lemon juice is acidic because it contains citric acid. The typical pH of lemon juice is between 2 and 3.

 Step 3: Compare the two.
 - Since the pH of lemon juice (around 2-3) is less than the pH of water (7), we can conclude that the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water.

 Final Answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding pH**:  
   pH is a scale used to measure the acidity or basicity of a solution. It ranges from 0 to 14:  
   - **pH < 7**: Acidic  
   - **pH = 7**: Neutral  
   - **pH > 7**: Basic  

2. **pH of Water**:  
   - Pure water (e.g., distilled water) is neutral and has a **pH of 7.0** at 25°C.  
   - Tap water may vary slightly (pH ~6.5–8.5 due to dissolved minerals), but it is still close to neutral. For comparison, we use **pH ≈ 7** as the baseline.  

3. **pH of Lemon Juice**:  
   - Lemon juice contains citric acid, making it acidic.  
   - Measured pH values for lemon juice typically range between **2.0 and 2.6**, depending on ripeness and variety.  

4. **Comparison**:  
   - Lemon juice pH (2.0–2.6) is **less than** the pH of water (~7.0).  
   - Since lower pH values indicate higher acidity, lemon juice is significantly more acidic than water.  

**Final Answer**: Yes
