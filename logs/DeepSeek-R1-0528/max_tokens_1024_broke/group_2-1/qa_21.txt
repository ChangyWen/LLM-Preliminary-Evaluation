*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Japan located east of China?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that China is a large country in East Asia. It's on the continent of Asia, and its eastern coast is along the Pacific Ocean.

Japan is an island nation also in East Asia. It's situated to the east of the Asian mainland.

Let me think about the geography. China has a long coastline facing east, towards the Pacific. Japan is a series of islands directly east of that coastline.

Specifically, Japan consists of islands like Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku. The main islands are positioned east of China.

For example, if I look at a map, China's easternmost point is around Shanghai or somewhere in that region. Japan's westernmost major island is Kyushu, which is east of Shanghai.

I should consider the coordinates to be precise.

China's approximate longitude: China spans from about 73°E to 135°E longitude. The eastern part is around 120°E to 135°E.

Japan's longitude: Japan is roughly between 129°E and 146°E longitude.

Comparing that, Japan's westernmost point is around 129°E, and China's easternmost point is around 135°E (near the border with North Korea, I think). But most of China's eastern coast is west of Japan.

Let me clarify:

- China's eastern coast, like Shanghai, is at approximately 121°E longitude.

- Tokyo, Japan, is at about 139°E longitude.

So, Tokyo is east of Shanghai because 139°E is greater than 121°E, meaning it's further east.

Longitude increases as you go east from the Prime Meridian (0°).

So, 139°E is east of 121°E, so Japan is east of China.

But is this true for all parts? Japan as a whole is east of China.

China has territories, but generally, the main part of China is west of Japan.

Also, there might be some small islands, but I think for this question, it's about the relative positions of the countries.

Another thing: is Japan directly east, or is it northeast or southeast? But the question is "east of China," which generally means to the east.

In terms of direction, Japan is to the east of China.

I can think about the time zones. Both are in UTC+8 or UTC+9, but Japan is UTC+9, China is UTC+8, so Japan is one hour ahead, which means it's further east.

Yes, that makes sense.

Also, historically, Japan is often referred to as being east of China; for example, it's called the "Land of the Rising Sun" because the sun rises in the east.

So, all evidence points to yes.

But let me make sure there's no trick. Is there any part of China that is east of Japan? I don't think so. China's easternmost point is the tip of the Shandong Peninsula or something, but it's still west of Japan.

For example, the Diaoyu Islands or Senkaku Islands are disputed, but they are east of China's mainland, and Japan claims them, so technically, they might be considered part of Japan, but even then, they are still east of the Chinese mainland.

The islands themselves are east of China, but if Japan administers them, it's consistent.

But for the main territories, Japan is east of China.

Perhaps I should consider the capital cities.

Beijing, China: approximately 116°E

Tokyo, Japan: 139°E

139 > 116, so Tokyo is east of Beijing.

Similarly, Shanghai: 121°E, still west of Tokyo.

Therefore, Japan is located east of China.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning," which I'm doing, and then "final answer (Yes or No)."

So, reasoning:

1. China is situated in East Asia with its eastern coast along the Pacific Ocean.

2. Japan is an island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, to the east of the Asian mainland.

3. Geographically, the longitude of China's eastern points (e.g., Shanghai at ~121°E) is less than that of Japan's main islands (e.g., Tokyo at ~139°E).

4. Since higher longitude values indicate positions further east, Japan is east of China.

5. Time zone difference: China is mostly in UTC+8, Japan in UTC+9, confirming Japan is further east.

Therefore, the answer is Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks whether Japan is located east of China. This requires comparing the geographic positions of both countries, focusing on their relative east-west orientation.

2. **Basic Geography**:
