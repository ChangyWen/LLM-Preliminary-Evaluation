*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan located south of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan?" I need to reason step by step and give a final yes or no answer.

I know that Williamsburg and Hillman Houses are both in Manhattan, New York City. But Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. That might be a mistake. Let me double-check.

Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" – that could be an error. Perhaps it's referring to something else, but typically, Williamsburg is in Brooklyn. Similarly, Hillman Houses – I think that might be a public housing complex in Manhattan.

Let me confirm the locations:

- Williamsburg: This is a neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn, New York City. It's not in Manhattan.

- Hillman Houses: I believe this is a public housing development located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Specifically, it's at 50 Pitt Street, Manhattan.

So, if Williamsburg is in Brooklyn and Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, then they are in different boroughs. The question is asking if Williamsburg is south of Hillman Houses, but since Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan, the phrasing "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" might be incorrect.

Perhaps the user meant to say Williamsburg, Brooklyn, but wrote Manhattan by mistake. Or maybe there's a Williamsburg in Manhattan? I don't think so. Let me think.

Another possibility: There might be a confusion with the name. Williamsburg is definitely in Brooklyn. Hillman Houses are in Manhattan.

To compare their positions, I need to think geographically.

First, Manhattan is an island, and it's oriented roughly north-south. The southern tip is Downtown, and it goes up to Uptown.

Brooklyn is to the southeast of Manhattan, across the East River.

So, to answer if Williamsburg is south of Hillman Houses, I need to see their relative positions.

Hillman Houses are in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which is on the southeastern part of Manhattan. Specifically, near the Manhattan Bridge, around Pitt Street and Grand Street.

Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, directly east of the Lower East Side, across the East River.

Now, in terms of latitude, Williamsburg is generally at a similar latitude to the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Let me get more precise.

I should look up the coordinates or general location.

Since I don't have real-time access, I'll rely on general knowledge.

The Lower East Side of Manhattan is south of, say, 14th Street, which is considered downtown. Hillman Houses are around Grand Street, which is quite far south in Manhattan. Grand Street is near the bottom of Manhattan.

Williamsburg in Brooklyn is directly opposite the Lower East Side. For example, the Williamsburg Bridge connects the Lower East Side to Williamsburg.

In terms of north-south, since Manhattan is tilted, but generally, the latitude might be similar.

Let's think about specific streets.

In Manhattan, streets are numbered, with lower numbers in the south. So, Hillman Houses are on Pitt Street, which is between East Broadway and Grand Street. Grand Street is one of the southern streets; south of that is the Financial District, but Lower East Side is around there.

Pitt Street runs from East Houston Street down to South Street, but Hillman Houses are near Grand Street, which is about latitude 40.715° N.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn: It spans from the East River to, say, Bushwick. Key areas are near the Williamsburg Bridge, which connects to Delancey Street in Manhattan. Delancey Street is around 40.718° N, similar to Grand Street.

Grand Street is at approximately 40.715° N, and Delancey is at 40.718° N, so very close.

But Williamsburg itself: the neighborhood center might be around Bedford Avenue, which is at roughly 40.714° N to 40.717° N, depending on the part.

So, both are around the same latitude, approximately 40.715° N to 40.718° N.

Therefore, Williamsburg is not significantly south or north of Hillman Houses; they are roughly at the same latitude.

But since Williamsburg is in Brooklyn and Hillman Houses are in Manhattan, and Brooklyn is to the east, not directly south.

The question is specifically about being south.

Latitude-wise, they are similar.

But let's be precise.

Hillman Houses: 50 Pitt Street, Manhattan, NY 10002. Latitude approximately 40.714° N.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn: Let's take, say, the Williamsburg Bridge entrance in Brooklyn, which is around 40.712° N, or Bedford Ave and N 7th Street, about 40.717° N.

So, it varies, but generally, Williamsburg is slightly south or same as
