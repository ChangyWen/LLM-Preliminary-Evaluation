*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Mount Everest taller than K2?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Mount Everest and K2 are both mountains, and they are among the highest in the world. Specifically, Mount Everest is the tallest mountain on Earth, and K2 is the second tallest. But I should confirm that with accurate data.

Let me recall the heights:

- Mount Everest is in the Himalayas, on the border between Nepal and China. Its height is approximately 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. I think that's the standard figure.

- K2 is in the Karakoram range, on the border between Pakistan and China. Its height is about 8,611 meters (28,251 feet). I'm not entirely sure, so I should think carefully.

I remember that K2 is often called the "Savage Mountain" and is considered more difficult to climb than Everest, but in terms of height, Everest is taller.

To be precise, I should think about the exact measurements. I think the official height of Mount Everest was confirmed as 8,848 meters by surveys. For K2, I believe it's 8,611 meters.

I can think about rankings: Mount Everest is the highest, K2 is the second-highest. So, by definition, Everest is taller than K2.

But to show step-by-step reasoning, I should state what I know.

Step 1: Identify the heights of both mountains.

- Mount Everest: 8,848 meters

- K2: 8,611 meters

I need to make sure these numbers are accurate. Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll use commonly accepted figures.

Step 2: Compare the two heights.

8,848 meters vs. 8,611 meters.

Is 8,848 greater than 8,611? Yes, clearly, because 8,848 - 8,611 = 237 meters. So, Everest is taller by 237 meters.

Therefore, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "taller than," which refers to height above sea level, I assume. Both are measured from sea level, so that should be fine.

I recall that there might be different measurements, like with snow cap or without, but generally, the figures I have are standard.

For example, Everest's height is often given as 8,848 m, and K2 as 8,611 m. I think that's consistent.

To be thorough, I can mention that according to various sources, including the National Geographic or survey data, Everest is taller.

But since this is a simple reasoning, I think the comparison is straightforward.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth, with an elevation of approximately 8,848 meters above sea level.

2. K2 is the second-highest mountain on Earth, with an elevation of approximately 8,611 meters above sea level.

3. Since 8,848 meters is greater than 8,611 meters, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

Therefore, the answer is Yes.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the heights of Mount Everest and K2:**
   - Mount Everest is located in the Himalayas, on the border of Nepal and China. Its official height, as recognized by multiple surveys (including those from Nepal, China, and international organizations), is **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)** above sea level. This measurement was jointly announced by Nepal and China in 2020 and is widely accepted.
   - K2, also known as Mount Godwin-Austen, is located in the Karakoram range on the border of Pakistan and China. Its official height is **8,611 meters (28,251 feet)** above sea level, based on modern surveys (e.g., from the Survey of Pakistan and international expeditions).

2. **Compare the heights:**
   - Mount Everest: 8,848.86 meters
   - K2: 8,611 meters
   - Subtract the height of K2 from Mount Everest to find the difference:
     - 8,848.86 m - 8,611 m = **237.86 meters**.
   - Since 8,848.86 > 8,611, Mount Everest is taller than K2 by approximately 238 meters.

3. **Consider any potential discrepancies:**
   - Heights of mountains can sometimes vary slightly due to factors like snow cover, seismic activity, or measurement techniques. However, the consensus among geologists, mountaineering authorities, and geographic institutions (e.g., National Geographic, the Himalayan Database) is that Mount Everest is definitively taller.
   - K2 is often referred to as the "second-highest mountain on Earth" in all reputable sources, which
