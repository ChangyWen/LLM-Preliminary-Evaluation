*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey died later than Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy. That means I have to find out their death dates and compare them.

I recall that William de Warenne was a Norman nobleman who fought in the Battle of Hastings in 1066. He was granted lands in England and became the first Earl of Surrey. I think he died in the late 11th century.

Agnes of Aquitaine was the daughter of William V, Duke of Aquitaine. She married Peter I of Savoy, so she became Countess of Savoy. I need her death date as well.

Let me start with William de Warenne. From history, I remember that he was born around 1030 and died in 1088. I should confirm that. I think he died on June 24, 1088. Yeah, that sounds right. He was killed at the siege of Pevensey Castle during a rebellion against William II.

Now, for Agnes of Aquitaine. She was also known as Agnes of Poitou or Agnes of Aquitaine. She was born around 1025 and married Peter I of Savoy around 1045 or so. I need her death date.

I think Agnes died in 1077 or 1078. Let me think. She was the mother of Bertha of Savoy, who married Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Bertha married Henry in 1066, I believe.

Agnes of Aquitaine died on December 14, 1077. I think that's it. I should double-check.

Perhaps I can think about the timeline. William de Warenne was active during the reign of William the Conqueror, who died in 1087. William de Warenne died in 1088, shortly after.

Agnes of Aquitaine was part of an earlier generation. She was the daughter of William V of Aquitaine, who died in 1030. Agnes was married to Peter I of Savoy, who died in 1078. I think Agnes died around the same time or shortly after.

I found online or recall that Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy, died in 1077. Specifically, December 14, 1077.

Now, William de Warenne died in 1088.

So, 1088 is later than 1077, meaning William died after Agnes.

But let's make sure about the dates.

Agnes of Aquitaine: I think there might be some confusion because there was another Agnes from Aquitaine, but this one is Agnes, daughter of William V, who married Peter of Savoy.

Peter I of Savoy died in 1078, and Agnes died before him or after? I think Agnes died in 1077.

Upon second thought, I remember that Agnes of Aquitaine died in 1077, and Peter I died in 1078.

William de Warenne died in 1088.

So, death years: Agnes in 1077, William in 1088.

1088 > 1077, so William died later.

The question is: did William die later than Agnes? So, yes, since 1088 is after 1077.

But I should confirm the sources to be accurate.

Since this is a reasoning process, I'll go with what I know.

Another thing: sometimes dates can be approximate, but in this case, both have specific dates.

Agnes: December 14, 1077.

William: June 24, 1088.

Clearly, 1088 is after 1077.

So, William died later than Agnes.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

The question is: "Did William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey die later than Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy?"

Based on the dates, yes.

Just to be thorough, let's make sure about Agnes's identity.

Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy, was born c. 1025 and died 1077. She was the wife of Peter I, Count of Savoy.

William de Warenne, born c. 1030, died 1088.

No overlap in death years; Agnes died 11 years before William.

So, definitely, William died later.

Final answer: Yes.
