*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are going to compare the release dates of two songs:
 1. "Pull Me Under" by Dream Theater
 2. "Jimmy James" by Beastie Boys

 Step 1: Recall or find the release dates for each song.

 For "Pull Me Under":
   - It is the lead single from Dream Theater's 1992 album "Images and Words".
   - The album "Images and Words" was released on July 7, 1992.
   - The single "Pull Me Under" was released in August 1992 (specifically, August 21, 1992, according to some sources).

 For "Jimmy James":
   - It is a song by the Beastie Boys from their album "Check Your Head".
   - The album "Check Your Head" was released on April 21, 1992.
   - The single "Jimmy James" was released as a promotional single in 1992, but the exact date might be around the album release or later? 
     However, note that the album came out in April 1992, so the song would have been released by then.

 But wait, let's check the exact release of the single "Jimmy James". 
   - According to available information, "Jimmy James" was not released as a commercial single but as a promotional single. 
   - The album "Check Your Head" was released on April 21, 1992, so the song "Jimmy James" was available from that date.

 Step 2: Compare the dates.
   - "Jimmy James": available from April 21, 1992.
   - "Pull Me Under": released as a single in August 1992 (specifically August 21, 1992).

 Therefore, the release of "Jimmy James" (April 21, 1992) is earlier than "Pull Me Under" (August 21, 1992).

 Final answer: 
   - No, "Pull Me Under" was not released earlier than "Jimmy James". Instead, "Jimmy James" was released earlier.

 But note: the question is: "Was Dream Theater’s Pull Me Under released earlier than Beastie Boys’s Jimmy James?"

 We have to answer with either Yes or No.

 Since "Pull Me Under" was released in August 1992 and "Jimmy James" was released in April 1992, then the answer is No.

 However, let's double-check the release dates:

   - Beastie Boys' "Check Your Head" album release: April 21, 1992 (which includes "Jimmy James")
   - Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under" single release: August 21, 1992

 Therefore, the song "Jimmy James" was released earlier.

 So the answer is: No.

 But note: sometimes singles are released before the album. However, in this case, "Jimmy James" was not released as a standalone single before the album. 
 It was included in the album and then released as a promotional single after the album? 

 Actually, the promotional single for "Jimmy James" was released in 1992, but the exact month is not clear. However, since the album was released in April, 
 the song was available to the public in April. Therefore, we can consider the release of the album as the release of the song for comparison.

 Alternatively, if we consider the release of the promotional single, it might be after the album. But typically, promotional singles are released around the same time as the album or shortly after.

 Let me try to find a specific date for the promotional single of "Jimmy James":
   - According to Discogs, the promotional single for "Jimmy James" (with catalog number PRO-CD-5615) was released in 1992, but without a specific day.
   - However, the album was released in April, and the promotional single would have been sent to radio stations around that time, so it would have been in April or May.

 But without an exact day, we can only rely on the album release date for the song's availability.

 So we have:
   - "Jimmy James": April 21, 1992 (album release) is the earliest date the song was available.
   - "Pull Me Under": August 21, 1992.

 Therefore, "Pull Me Under" was released later.

 Answer: No, Pull Me Under was not released earlier than Jimmy James.

 Final Answer: No
