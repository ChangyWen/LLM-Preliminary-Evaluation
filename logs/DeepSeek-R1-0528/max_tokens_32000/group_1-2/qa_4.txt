*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan located south of WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I should recall where these places are. Hillman Houses and Williamsburg are both in Manhattan, New York City. But Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. That might be a key point.

Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, which is a separate borough from Manhattan. The question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," but that might be a mistake. Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan; it's in Brooklyn. Similarly, Hillman Houses is a housing project in Manhattan.

Let me confirm the locations:

- Hillman Houses: I believe this is a public housing complex located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Specifically, it's near the East River, around Grand Street or thereabouts.

- Williamsburg: This is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, directly across the East River from the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

So, if Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, and Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, then they are in different boroughs. But the question is about whether Hillman Houses is south of Williamsburg, Manhattan. The "Manhattan" part for Williamsburg might be incorrect.

Perhaps the question has a typo or mislabeling. Williamsburg is not in Manhattan; it's in Brooklyn. So, when it says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," it could be a mistake. Maybe it's referring to something else, but I think it's safe to assume it means the Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn.

Now, to determine if Hillman Houses is south of Williamsburg.

First, I need to understand the geographical positions.

Manhattan is oriented roughly north-south, with Downtown (south) and Uptown (north). Brooklyn is to the east and southeast of Manhattan.

Specifically, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is located directly east of the Lower East Side of Manhattan, across the East River.

The Lower East Side of Manhattan includes areas like Chinatown, and it's generally south of Midtown Manhattan.

Hillman Houses is situated on the Lower East Side. I think it's around Grand Street and Columbia Street, near the Williamsburg Bridge.

The Williamsburg Bridge connects the Lower East Side of Manhattan to Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

So, let's think about the coordinates.

Typically, in New York City, north is up. So, the southern tip of Manhattan is Battery Park, and it goes north to Harlem and beyond.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is at a latitude that is roughly equivalent to the Lower East Side or East Village in Manhattan.

For example, the Williamsburg Bridge starts around Delancey Street or East Broadway in Manhattan, which is in the Lower East Side, and goes to Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Delancey Street is around the border between the Lower East Side and the East Village, but it's generally considered part of the Lower East Side.

Hillman Houses: I think it's located at 80 Pitt Street, which is between Grand Street and Broome Street, on the Lower East Side.

Grand Street is a major street in the Lower East Side, running east-west.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is directly across the river. The main part of Williamsburg is centered around Bedford Avenue, and it spans from around North 7th Street to South 5th Street or so, but in terms of latitude, it's similar to the Lower East Side.

Now, to compare latitudes:

- In Manhattan, streets are numbered, with lower numbers in the south. For example, Houston Street is a divider; south of Houston is considered Downtown, including the Lower East Side south part.

Grand Street is south of Houston Street. Houston is around 1st to 3rd Streets, while Grand is further south, around D or E, but street numbers vary.

In Manhattan, the grid starts with 1st Street at Houston, but south of Houston, it's not numbered; it's named streets like Canal, Grand, Broome, etc.

Canal Street is one of the southernmost, then Grand Street is north of Canal, then Broome, etc.

Standard order from south to north: Battery, then Wall Street area (not numbered), then Chinatown with Canal Street, then Little Italy with Grand Street, etc.

Canal Street is roughly the boundary, south of that is more Financial District, but Lower East Side is east of that.

Lower East Side: bounded by East River, Bowery, Canal Street, and roughly 14th Street or Houston to the north.

Houston Street is the northern boundary.

Streets south of Houston: for example, Stanton, Rivington, Delancey, Broome, Grand, Canal.

From north to south: Houston (north), then Stanton, Rivington, Delancey, Broome, Grand, Canal (south).

Delancey is between Rivington and Broome? Let's clarify:

Common streets in Lower East Side from north to south:

- Houston Street (northern boundary)

- Stanton Street

- Rivington Street

- Delancey Street

- Broome Street

- Grand Street

- Canal Street (southern boundary)

Yes, so Canal is south, then Grand, then Broome, then Delancey, etc.

Hillman Houses is on Grand Street, I believe. Specifically, between Grand and Broome, near Columbia Street.

Grand Street is south of Broome Street? No:

If we go from north to south: Houston, then Stanton (south of Houston), Rivington (south of Stanton), Delancey (south of Rivington), Broome (south of Delancey), Grand (south of Broome), Canal (south of Grand).

So, Grand Street is just north of Canal Street, so it's relatively south in Manhattan.

Now, Williamsburg, Brooklyn: the neighborhood is roughly between North 12th Street and South 5th Street in Brooklyn, but Brooklyn has its own street numbering.

In Brooklyn, streets are numbered, with numbers increasing as you go south or north from a point.

Williamsburg is around the area where the Williamsburg Bridge lands, which is at Broadway and Driggs Avenue, etc.

The latitude: the Williamsburg Bridge connects from Delancey Street in Manhattan to Broadway in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Delancey Street in Manhattan is at a certain latitude.

For comparison, Delancey Street is about the same latitude as the northern part of Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Since the bridge connects directly, Delancey Street in Manhattan and the area around Broadway in Williamsburg are at approximately the same latitude.

Hillman Houses is on Grand Street, which is south of Delancey Street.

As I listed earlier: from north to south, Delancey is north of Broome, and Broome is north of Grand.

So, Grand Street is south of Delancey Street.

Therefore, Hillman Houses on Grand Street is south of Delancey Street.

Since Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is at the latitude of Delancey Street (or similar), that means Hillman Houses is south of the latitude of Williamsburg.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn, spans a range, but the core is around the bridge area.

For example, the Marcy Avenue subway station in Williamsburg is on the J/M/Z lines, which is at about the same level.

But let's think in terms of coordinates.

I can use approximate addresses or cross streets.

Hillman Houses: 80 Pitt Street, New York, NY. Pitt Street is between Grand Street and Broome Street? Pitt Street runs north-south, intersecting east-west streets.

Grand Street and Pitt Street: Hillman Houses is bounded by Grand Street, Columbia Street, and other streets. But essentially, it's on the Lower East Side near Grand Street.

Latitude of Grand Street and Pitt: approximately 40.716°N.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn: let's say the Williamsburg Bridge Brooklyn side is at Broadway and Driggs, latitude around 40.712°N or something. I need to look this up, but since I'm reasoning, I'll estimate.

Generally, the East River flows south, but the banks are not perfectly aligned.

Manhattan tilts slightly, but roughly, the Lower East Side and Williamsburg are at similar latitudes.

Specifically, Delancey Street in Manhattan is about 40.718°N.

Grand Street is south of that, say 40.715°N.

Williamsburg Bridge Brooklyn side: approximately 40.713°N.

But let's be more precise.

I recall that in terms of north-south position, the southern part of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is south of the northern part, but compared to Manhattan.

Canal Street in Manhattan is about 40.719°N? No.

Standard latitudes:

- Battery Park: 40.70°N

- Canal Street: around 40.718°N

- Houston Street: 40.725°N

- 14th Street: 40.734°N

Canal Street: let's say 40.717°N

Grand Street: since it's between Canal and Houston, and Canal is south, Houston north.

Canal at 40.717, Houston at 40.726, so Grand is closer to Canal, say 40.718°N? No, Grand is north of Canal.

Streets: Canal at 40.717, then next is Grand? Canal to Grand is a few blocks.

From south to north: Canal, then Division, then Market, then Cherry, then Henry, then Montgomery, then Grand? I think I have the order wrong.

Better to use a numbered reference.

In Manhattan, the street grid: from 1st Street at Houston, but south of Houston, streets are named.

Approximate latitudes:

- Canal Street: 40.717°N

- Broome Street: 40.721°N

- Delancey Street: 40.719°N? Delancey is between Broome and Grand? Let's list properly.

Common streets:

- Canal Street: 40.717°N

- Grand Street: 40.719°N (just north of Canal)

- Broome Street: 40.721°N (north of Grand)

- Delancey Street: 40.718°N? This is messy.

I think Delancey is around 40.718°N, Grand at 40.719°N, but that can't be right because Grand is south of Broome.

Let's use actual data.

I know that the Williamsburg Bridge Manhattan entrance is at Delancey and Clinton, latitude about 40.715°N.

Similarly, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the bridge lands at Broadway and Driggs, latitude about 40.712°N.

But let's take Hillman Houses: located at 40.714°N, 73.980°W (approximately).

Williamsburg, let's take a central point, say Bedford Ave and N 7th St, which is about 40.714°N, 73.957°W.

Bedford and N 7th is in Williamsburg, latitude 40.714°N.

Hillman Houses at 40.714°N? That would be the same latitude.

But let's confirm.

Hillman Houses: I looked it up in my mind; it's at Grand and Columbia, which is roughly 40.714°N.

Williamsburg: Bedford Ave and N 7th St is 40.714°N.

So approximately the same latitude.

But is Hillman Houses exactly at the same point?

Perhaps for practical purposes, they are at similar latitudes.

But the question is whether it is south.

Since both are at about 40.714°N, they are at the same latitude, so one is not south of the other; they are east-west of each other.

Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, Williamsburg in Brooklyn, so Hillman is west of Williamsburg, but not south.

If latitudes are equal, then neither is south; south would be lower latitude.

Latitude decreases as you go south.

So if both are 40.714°N, then same latitude.

But let's get a better point.

Williamsburg as a neighborhood has a range.

For example, the southern part of Williamsburg might be around South 4th Street, which is about 40.710°N.

Northern part around N 12th, 40.722°N.

Hillman Houses at 40.714°N.

So, 40.714°N is between the min and max of Williamsburg, but compared to the central point, it's similar.

But to be precise, is Hillman Houses south of Williamsburg, Manhattan? But Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan.

The question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" which is incorrect, but I think we have to go with the intent.

Perhaps there is a Williamsburg in Manhattan, but I doubt it. Williamsburg is Brooklyn.

Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be Williamsburg Bridge or something, but it says Williamsburg.

Another thought: there is a Williamsburg Houses in Brooklyn, but that's not in Manhattan.

The question is about Hillman Houses in Manhattan and Williamsburg in Manhattan? But Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan.

I think I should proceed with Williamsburg being in Brooklyn.

So, Hillman Houses at approximately 40.714°N.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn: let's take the average or a specific point.

The Williamsburg Bridge connects Delancey St in Manhattan (40.715°N) to Broadway in Brooklyn (40.712°N), so the Brooklyn side is slightly south.

Hillman Houses is on Grand Street, which is south of Delancey.

Grand Street latitude: approximately 40.713°N or 40.714°N.

Williamsburg Bridge Brooklyn side: 40.712°N.

So Hillman Houses at 40.714°N, Williamsburg at 40.712°N, so Williamsburg is slightly south.

40.714 vs 40.712, so 40.714 is north of 40.712, since latitude increases north.

So Hillman Houses at 40.714°N is north of Williamsburg at 40.712°N.

Therefore, Hillman Houses is north of Williamsburg, not south.

Let's confirm coordinates.

Hillman Houses: 40.7142°N, 73.9811°W (from memory or standard)

Williamsburg, say Marcy Ave and Broadway: 40.7083°N, 73.9578°W — that's south.

Better to take a central point.

Bedford Ave and N 7th St: 40.7145°N, 73.9570°W

Hillman Houses: 40.7142°N, 73.9811°W

So latitude: 40.7142 vs 40.7145, almost identical, but 40.7142 is very slightly south of 40.7145, but essentially the same.

Difference is 0.0003 degrees, which is negligible; they are at the same latitude for practical purposes.

But 40.7142 is south of 40.7145? No: 40.7142 is less than 40.7145, so lower latitude, which is south.

Latitude: smaller number is south.

40.7142 < 40.7145, so Hillman at 40.7142 is south of Bedford and N 7th at 40.7145.

But that's a specific point; Williamsburg extends north and south.

The southern boundary of Williamsburg is around South 5th Street, which is about 40.710°N, and northern around N 12th at 40.722°N.

Hillman Houses at 40.7142°N.

Compared to the northern part of Williamsburg, Hillman is south; compared to the southern part, it's north.

But the core of Williamsburg is around N 4th to N 9th, say 40.714 to 40.717.

Hillman at 40.714 is within that range.

But to answer "south of Williamsburg," it depends on what is considered Williamsburg.

Typically, since Williamsburg is across the river, and Hillman is on the Manhattan side at the same latitude, it's not distinctly south; it's adjacent.

But strictly speaking, since the latitude is the same or very close, it's not south; it's west.

However, in the context of the question, since Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, and Manhattan is to the west, but the Lower East Side is directly across.

But the question is about south direction.

Another way: in terms of city directions, people might think of downtown as south.

But Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, so comparing directions between boroughs.

Perhaps the question has a mistake with "Williamsburg, Manhattan."

Let's read the question: "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" – but Williamsburg is not in Manhattan.

There is no neighborhood called Williamsburg in Manhattan. Williamsburg is Brooklyn.

Perhaps it's a reference to the Williamsburg Bridge or something, but it says Williamsburg.

Maybe it's Williamsburg Houses, which is a housing project in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

But the question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which is likely a error.

I think I should assume that "Williamsburg" means the neighborhood in Brooklyn, and "Manhattan" for Hillman Houses is correct.

So, for practical purposes, Hillman Houses and Williamsburg are at approximately the same latitude, so Hillman is not south of Williamsburg; it's directly west.

Therefore, the answer should be no.

But let's see if there's a southern part.

For example, if we take the southern tip of Williamsburg, it might be south, but Hillman is at 40.714, and southern Williamsburg is around 40.710, so 40.714 is north of 40.710, so Hillman is north of southern Williamsburg.

Latitude 40.714 vs 40.710, 40.714 > 40.710, so north.

Similarly, northern Williamsburg at 40.722, Hillman at 40.714 is south of that.

But on average, same.

The question is "south of Williamsburg," which might imply the location as a whole.

But in geography, if a point is south of another point, it has lower latitude.

Since Williamsburg has a range, we need a reference point.

Typically, when people say "south of Williamsburg," they might mean the area, but for comparison, we can use the centroid or a major point.

I think it's safe to say that Hillman Houses is not south of Williamsburg; they are at the same latitude.

Moreover, since the bridge connects at Delancey, and Hillman is south of Delancey, but the Brooklyn side is slightly south, so Hillman might be at a higher latitude than the bridge point.

Earlier: Delancey St Manhattan: ~40.715°N

Williamsburg Bridge Brooklyn: ~40.712°N

Hillman Houses: on Grand St, ~40.713°N or 40.714

Grand St latitude is approximately 40.7135°N

Delancey St is 40.7150°N

So Grand St (Hillman) is south of Delancey St.

Williamsburg Bridge Brooklyn is 40.7120°N, so south of Delancey.

Hillman at 40.7135°N, Williamsburg Bridge at 40.7120°N, so Hillman at 40.7135 is north of 40.7120, so not south.

If we take a point in Williamsburg like Bedford and N 7th at 40.7145, Hillman at 40.7135 is very slightly south, but 40.7135 < 40.7145, so south, but the difference is tiny.

40.7135 vs 40.7145, difference of 0.001 degrees, which is about 100 meters, negligible.

For all practical purposes, they are east-west.

But to be precise, Hillman Houses is very slightly south of the central Williamsburg point, but not significantly.

However, the question might expect a simple answer.

Another idea: perhaps "Williamsburg, Manhattan" is a misnomer, and it's meant to be a different location.

Maybe it's referring to the Williamsburg Bridge in Manhattan, but the bridge is not a location to be south of.

I think I should conclude that Hillman Houses is not located south of Williamsburg; it's approximately at the same latitude or slightly north/south but not distinctly south.

Since the question says "south of WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," and Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, the premise is flawed.

But I have to answer based on geography.

Final decision: based on coordinates, Hillman Houses and Williamsburg are at similar latitudes, with Hillman very slightly south in some comparisons but north in others, so overall, no, it is not south of Williamsburg.

Let's look for a source or common knowledge.

I recall that the Lower East Side, where Hillman Houses is, is generally considered to be at the same level as Williamsburg across the river.

For example, when you cross the Williamsburg Bridge, you go from Delancey St to Williamsburg, and Grand St is south of Delancey, so if you are at Grand St, you are south of the bridge entrance, but the bridge entrance is not Williamsburg; Williamsburg is the neighborhood.

In Williamsburg, the area south of the bridge might be considered south Williamsburg.

But Hillman Houses is on Grand St, which is south of Delancey, so in Manhattan, it's south of the bridge point.

In Brooklyn, the bridge lands, and south of that is South Williamsburg.

But South Williamsburg has lower latitude.

Hillman at 40.714, South Williamsburg at 40.710, so Hillman is north.

I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let me simplify: Hillman Houses is in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which is south of areas like Greenwich Village or Chelsea, but Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, directly east.

For the purpose of this question, since Williamsburg is east of Manhattan, and the Lower East Side is the part facing it, they are not in a north-south line; Manhattan is west, Brooklyn east.

So, Hillman Houses is not south of Williamsburg; it's west.

Therefore, the answer should be no.

If we must answer based on latitude, it's roughly the same.

But the question is "located south of", which implies a clear south position.

Since Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, and the latitude is similar, it's not south.

I think the answer is no.

Perhaps there's a place called Williamsburg in Manhattan, but I doubt it.

Another thought: there is the Williamsburg Bridge, which has a Manhattan side, but "Williamsburg, Manhattan" isn't a thing.

I think I should go with no.
*********************************** End of Thinking ************************************




**************************************** Content ***************************************
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations:**
   - **Hillman Houses**: This is a public housing complex located in Manhattan, specifically on the Lower East Side. The address is around 80 Pitt Street, near the intersection of Grand Street and Columbia Street.
   - **Williamsburg**: This is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The query mentions "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," but this appears to be a geographical error. Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, directly across the East River from the Lower East Side of Manhattan. There is no neighborhood or area called "Williamsburg" within Manhattan itself.

2. **Clarify the geographical relationship:**
   - Manhattan and Brooklyn are separate boroughs, with the East River separating them. Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is situated directly east of Manhattan's Lower East Side.
   - To determine if Hillman Houses is south of Williamsburg, we need to compare their latitudes (since "south" implies a lower latitude).

3. **Determine approximate latitudes:**
   - **Hillman Houses**: Located on Grand Street in the Lower East Side, which has an approximate latitude of 40.714°N.
   - **Williamsburg, Brooklyn**: As a neighborhood, it spans a range of latitudes. For reference:
     - The Williamsburg Bridge connects Delancey Street in Manhattan (approx. 40.715°N) to Broadway in Williamsburg, Brooklyn (approx. 40.712°N).
     - A central point in Williamsburg, like Bedford Avenue and North 7th Street, has a latitude of approximately 40.714°N.
     - The southern part of Williamsburg (e.g., around South 4th Street) is at about 40.710°N, and the northern part (e.g., near North 12th Street) is around 40.722°N.

4. **Compare latitudes:**
   - Hillman Houses at ~40.714°N is very close to the central Williamsburg point at ~40.714°N (Bedford and N 7th), indicating they are at nearly the same latitude.
   - Specifically:
     - Hillman Houses (40.714°N) is slightly north of the Williamsburg Bridge's Brooklyn landing point (40.712°N).
     - Compared to the southern boundary of Williamsburg (~40.710°N), Hillman Houses is north (since 40.714°N > 40.710°N).
     - Compared to the northern boundary of Williamsburg (~40.722°N), Hillman Houses is south (40.714°N < 40.722°N).
   - Overall, the latitudes are so similar that Hillman Houses and central Williamsburg are effectively at the same latitude, with no significant north-south displacement.

5. **Directional relationship:**
   - Since the latitudes are nearly identical, Hillman Houses is not distinctly south of Williamsburg. Instead, it is directly west of Williamsburg, as Manhattan is west of Brooklyn.
   - The query's phrasing "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" is incorrect, as Williamsburg is not in Manhattan. Assuming the intent was to refer to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the geographical comparison stands.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on latitude, Hillman Houses is not south of Williamsburg; it is approximately at the same latitude and slightly to the west. Therefore, the answer to the query is no.

**Final Answer: No**
