*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Cattaraugus County in New York is west of Cambria County in Pennsylvania. I'll do this step by step.

I should start by recalling where these counties are located. Cattaraugus County is in western New York, and Cambria County is in western Pennsylvania. But I need to be precise about their longitudes since "west" refers to the longitudinal position.

Longitude measures how far east or west a location is. The lower the longitude, the further west it is, assuming we're using the standard where negative values are west of the Prime Meridian. In the US, longitudes are typically negative because they're west of Greenwich.

Cattaraugus County, NY: I think it's in the western part of New York State. New York State is on the east coast, but Cattaraugus is towards the west, near the Pennsylvania border and Lake Erie.

Cambria County, PA: Pennsylvania is also on the east coast, but Cambria is in the western part, near Johnstown.

I should look up the approximate longitudes of these counties. Since I don't have a map, I'll use my general knowledge or think about cities.

For Cattaraugus County, the largest city might be Olean or something. Olean, NY is in Cattaraugus County. What is the longitude of Olean? I think it's around 78.4°W.

Similarly, for Cambria County, Johnstown is a major city there. Johnstown, PA longitude is about 78.9°W.

I need to verify that. I should be careful.

Let me think about the states: New York is to the north and east of Pennsylvania, but the western parts might be different.

Cattaraugus County is in the very southwest corner of New York, bordering Pennsylvania. Cambria County is in west-central Pennsylvania.

I recall that the border between New York and Pennsylvania is a straight line along 42°N latitude, but counties have different longitudes.

Longitude: The westernmost point of Pennsylvania is around 80.5°W, and the easternmost is about 74.7°W. But Cambria County is not the westernmost; it's more central.

Johnstown, PA: I believe it's at approximately 78.92°W.

Olean, NY: I think it's around 78.43°W.

If that's true, Olean at 78.43°W is west of Johnstown at 78.92°W? No.

Longitude: smaller number (less negative) is east, larger number (more negative) is west.

78.43°W vs 78.92°W: 78.43 is less than 78.92, so 78.43°W is actually east of 78.92°W because -78.43 is greater than -78.92.

Let's think in terms of decimal degrees.

Assume west longitudes are negative for ease.

So, Olean, NY: approximately -78.43° (78.43°W)

Johnstown, PA: approximately -78.92° (78.92°W)

Now, -78.43 is greater than -78.92 because -78.43 is to the right on the number line, meaning it's east of -78.92.

For example, -78 is east of -79 because -78 is closer to zero.

So, -78.43 is about 78.43 west, and -78.92 is about 78.92 west. Since 78.92 is further west, -78.92 is smaller, so it's west of -78.43.

Therefore, Johnstown at -78.92° is west of Olean at -78.43°.

But Olean is in Cattaraugus County, and Johnstown is in Cambria County.

So, if Johnstown is west of Olean, that means Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County? That can't be right because Cattaraugus is in NY, which is north, and Cambria is in PA, which is south, but in terms of longitude.

Cattaraugus County is along the southern border of NY, so it should be at similar longitudes to northern PA counties.

But let's confirm the longitudes.

I think I have the longitudes wrong.

Let me think about the cities.

Olean, NY: I recall it's near the Pennsylvania border. The longitude is approximately 78.43°W, but is that accurate?

Perhaps I should look at the county seats or centroids.

Cattaraugus County seat is Little Valley, NY. What is its longitude? I think Little Valley is also around 78.8°W or something. I'm confusing myself.

Let's use a better approach. I know that the western border of Pennsylvania is at about 80.5°W, and the eastern border is at 74.7°W. Cambria County is not far from the western border.

Johnstown, PA is in Cambria County, and it's at 78.92°W, as I said.

For Cattaraugus County, let's take Salamanca or Olean. Olean is at 78.43°W, and Salamanca is at 78.72°W or something.

Salamanca, NY is in Cattaraugus County and it's on the border. Salamanca longitude is approximately 78.72°W.

Let me assume:

- Salamanca, NY (Cattaraugus County): 78.72°W

- Johnstown, PA (Cambria County): 78.92°W

Now, 78.72°W vs 78.92°W: 78.72 is less than 78.92, so 78.72°W is east of 78.92°W.

Therefore, Salamanca is east of Johnstown.

Since Salamanca is in Cattaraugus County, and Johnstown is in Cambria County, Cattaraugus County is east of Cambria County.

But the question is whether Cattaraugus is west of Cambria, which would be the opposite.

If Cattaraugus is east, then it is not west.

But let's double-check the longitudes.

I can think about the relative positions.

Pennsylvania and New York share a border. The border runs east-west along 42°N.

Cattaraugus County is the county in New York that is directly north of the Pennsylvania border. Cambria County is in Pennsylvania, south of that border but not directly south of Cattaraugus.

Let's look at a mental map.

Cambria County, PA is centered around Johnstown, which is in the Laurel Highlands, west of the Allegheny Mountains. It's about 70-80 miles east of Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh is at about 80.0°W.

Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh, so less west, say 78.92°W.

Cattaraugus County, NY is west of Buffalo. Buffalo is at about 78.89°W? No, Buffalo is at 78.85°W or something. I think I need accurate numbers.

Buffalo, NY is at approximately 78.85°W.

Olean, NY is south of Buffalo, at about 78.43°W? That can't be right because Olean is west of Buffalo, I think.

Let's clarify.

Buffalo is at the western tip of New York, on Lake Erie. Longitude of Buffalo is around 78.88°W.

Olean is southeast of Buffalo, so it should be at a similar longitude or a bit east.

Actually, Olean is south of Buffalo, but not directly; it's inland. From memory, Olean is at approximately 78.43°W, but that might be too far east.

I think I have a mistake.

Let me recall: the longitude of New York City is about 74°W, so western NY should be around 79°W.

For example, Jamestown, NY is in Chautauqua County, which is next to Cattaraugus. Jamestown is at about 79.24°W.

Cattaraugus County is to the east of Chautauqua County.

So, Cattaraugus County has cities like Olean and Salamanca.

Olean, NY longitude: I believe it is 78.43°W, but let's confirm with Jamestown.

Jamestown, NY: 79.24°W (approximately)

Buffalo, NY: 78.85°W

Since Olean is between Buffalo and Jamestown? Jamestown is west of Buffalo, I think.

Buffalo is at 78.85°W, Jamestown is at 79.24°W, so Jamestown is west of Buffalo.

Cattaraugus County is east of Chautauqua County, so it should be between Buffalo and Jamestown, but since Jamestown is west, Cattaraugus would be east of Jamestown.

Olean, in Cattaraugus, is at approximately 78.43°W, which is east of Buffalo's 78.85°W? 78.43 is less than 78.85, so 78.43°W is east of 78.85°W.

That seems right because Olean is southeast of Buffalo.

For example, from Buffalo to Olean, you go southeast, so both south and a bit east, so longitude increases eastward? No.

Longitude decreases as you go west.

Prime Meridian is 0, increasing east to 180, or west to -180. In the US, we use west longitude, so higher numbers are further west.

For example, New York City is 74°W, Chicago is 87°W, so 87 is west of 74.

Similarly, in NY, Albany is about 73.8°W, Buffalo is 78.85°W, so Buffalo is west of Albany.

Olean, NY is at 78.43°W, which is between Albany and Buffalo, but since 78.43 < 78.85, Olean is east of Buffalo.

Yes, that makes sense.

Now, for Pennsylvania, Philadelphia is about 75.16°W, Pittsburgh is 80.00°W, Johnstown is about 78.92°W.

So Johnstown is at 78.92°W.

Olean is at 78.43°W, which is less than 78.92, so Olean is east of Johnstown.

Therefore, Cattaraugus County (with Olean) is east of Cambria County (with Johnstown).

But the question is if Cattaraugus is west of Cambria, which would be false.

But let's make sure about the counties.

Cattaraugus County, NY: the western part might be further west.

Salamanca, NY is in Cattaraugus County and it's on the Allegheny River, longitude about 78.72°W.

Salamanca is closer to the border.

Longitude of Salamanca: I think it's approximately 78.72°W.

Johnstown, PA is 78.92°W.

78.72 < 78.92, so Salamanca is east of Johnstown.

The westernmost point of Cattaraugus County might be near the Chautauqua County line, which is around 79.0°W or something.

Chautauqua County is to the west, and its county seat is Mayville, but Jamestown is at 79.24°W.

Cattaraugus County's western border is with Chautauqua County, which is at about 79.2°W, but Cattaraugus itself is east of that.

For example, the centroid of Cattaraugus County might be around 78.6°W or something.

Similarly, Cambria County, PA: Johnstown is at 78.92°W, but the county extends west to near Indiana County, which is around 79.1°W, but Cambria's western border is less than that.

Let's find approximate min and max longitudes.

I can use online knowledge or general facts.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I should conclude based on standard knowledge.

Another way: Cattaraugus County, NY is directly north of McKean County, PA, and Warren County, PA.

Cambria County, PA is to the southeast of that.

McKean County, PA has Bradford as a city, which is at about 78.65°W.

Bradford, PA is at 78.64°W.

Cattaraugus County is north of McKean, so similar longitude.

Olean, NY is at 78.43°W, which is east of Bradford, PA at 78.64°W? 78.43 < 78.64, so Olean east of Bradford.

Bradford is in McKean County, which is adjacent to Cambria County to the east.

Cambria County is east of McKean County.

McKean County, PA borders New York, and Cambria County is south of Clearfield County and east of Indiana County.

The longitude: Johnstown, Cambria County is at 78.92°W, while Bradford, McKean County is at 78.64°W.

78.64 < 78.92, so Bradford is east of Johnstown.

But McKean County is west of Cambria County.

Cattaraugus County is north of McKean County, so at similar longitudes, around 78.6-78.7°W.

Cambria County is around 78.8-79.0°W.

For example, the eastern part of Cambria County might be less west, but Johnstown is at 78.92, and it's central.

The western border of Cambria County is with Indiana County, which has Indiana, PA at 79.15°W, so Cambria western border around 79.0°W.

Cattaraugus County, the western border is with Chautauqua, at about 79.2°W, but Cattaraugus eastern part is around 78.4°W.

The centroid or major point: let's take Salamanca as a reference for Cattaraugus, at 78.72°W.

Johnstown at 78.92°W.

78.72 vs 78.92: 78.72 is smaller, so Salamanca is east of Johnstown.

Therefore, Cattaraugus County is east of Cambria County.

Thus, it is not west; it is east.

So, to answer "is Cattaraugus west of Cambria?", the answer should be no.

But let's confirm with another point.

I recall that the city of Bradford, PA is at 78.64°W, and it's in McKean County, which is directly south of Cattaraugus County, NY.

The northern part of McKean County borders Cattaraugus County, so Cattaraugus has similar longitude to Bradford, around 78.6°W.

Cambria County is to the east-southeast, with Johnstown at 78.92°W, which is west of 78.6, so Johnstown is west of Bradford.

Since Bradford is at 78.64°W and Johnstown at 78.92°W, Johnstown is west of Bradford.

Therefore, Cambria County is west of McKean County, and since Cattaraugus is north of McKean, Cattaraugus is also east of Cambria County.

In other words, Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County.

So, Cattaraugus is not west of Cambria; instead, Cambria is west of Cattaraugus.

Therefore, the answer should be no.

The question is: "Is Cattaraugus County, NY located west of Cambria County, PA?"

Based on this, no.

But to be thorough, let's consider the extreme points.

The westernmost point of Cattaraugus County, NY is approximately 79.0°W, near the Chautauqua border.

The easternmost point of Cambria County, PA might be around 78.5°W or something.

Cambria County's eastern border is with Somerset County, which has Somerset, PA at 79.08°W? No.

Somerset, PA is at 79.08°W, but that's west.

Cambria County: Johnstown is at 78.92, and the county extends east to near Bedford County.

Bedford, PA is at 78.50°W, so Cambria eastern border around 78.6°W.

Cattaraugus County western border at 79.0°W, eastern around 78.4°W.

Cambria County western border around 79.0°W, eastern around 78.6°W.

There might be overlap, but on average, Cattaraugus is centered east of Cambria.

For example, the longitude of Little Valley, Cattaraugus seat, is 78.80°W? Little Valley is at approximately 78.80°W.

Johnstown at 78.92°W.

78.80 < 78.92, so Little Valley is east of Johnstown.

Salamanca at 78.72°W, also east of Johnstown.

So, consistently, points in Cattaraugus are east of points in Cambria.

Therefore, Cattaraugus County is not west of Cambria County; it is east.

So the answer should be no.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine if Cattaraugus County, NY is located west of Cambria County, PA, I need to compare their longitudinal positions. Longitude measures how far east or west a location is, with more negative values (or higher numerical values in degrees west) indicating a more westerly position. I will use approximate longitudes of key points in each county for comparison.

1. **Identify Key Reference Points:**
   - **Cattaraugus County, NY:** This county is in western New York. I'll use the longitude of Salamanca, NY, a city within Cattaraugus County near the Pennsylvania border, as a representative point. Salamanca is approximately at **78.72°W**.
   - **Cambria County, PA:** This county is in western Pennsylvania. I'll use the longitude of Johnstown, PA, the county seat of Cambria County, as a representative point. Johnstown is approximately at **78.92°W**.

2. **Compare Longitudes:**
   - Longitude is measured in degrees west (W), where a higher numerical value indicates a more westerly location.
   - Salamanca, NY (Cattaraugus County): **78.72°W**
   - Johnstown, PA (Cambria County): **78.92°W**
   - Since 78.72°W is less than 78.92°W, Salamanca is east of Johnstown. Therefore, Cattaraugus County is generally east of Cambria County.

3. **Consider Geographic Context:**
   - Cattaraugus County, NY, is located in the southwestern part of New York, directly north of Pennsylvania's McKean County (which borders Cambria County to the west). McKean County's reference point, Bradford, PA, is at approximately **78.64°W**, which is also east of Johnstown (78.92°W). This reinforces that Cattaraugus County is not west of Cambria County.
   - Cambria County, PA, is positioned further west in Pennsylvania compared to the adjacent New York counties. For example, the western border of Cambria County extends to about **79.0°W** (near Indiana County), while the western border of Cattaraugus County is around **79.0°W** (near Chautauqua County). However, the central and eastern parts of Cattaraugus County (e.g., Salamanca at 78.72°W and Olean at 78.43°W) are consistently east of Cambria County's central point (Johnstown at 78.92°W).

4. **Conclusion Based on Longitude:**
   - Since Salamanca (Cattaraugus County) at 78.72°W is east of Johnstown (Cambria County) at 78.92°W, Cattaraugus County is not west of Cambria County. Instead, Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County.

**Final Answer: No**
