*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Dal-Tex Building, TX located south of Lake Martin, AL?" I need to reason step by step and give a final yes or no answer.

I need to know where Dal-Tex Building is and where Lake Martin is. Dal-Tex Building is in Texas, and Lake Martin is in Alabama. Specifically, Dal-Tex Building is likely in Dallas, Texas, because I think that's where the Dal-Tex Building is located. I should confirm that.

Dal-Tex Building: I recall that it's a historic building in Dallas, Texas. It's famous for being near Dealey Plaza, where the JFK assassination happened. So, I'll assume it's in Dallas, TX.

Lake Martin, AL: That's in Alabama. Lake Martin is a large reservoir in central Alabama, near cities like Alexander City.

Now, I need to compare their latitudes to see if Dal-Tex Building is south of Lake Martin. Since south is determined by latitude, lower latitude means further south.

So, I need the latitudes of both places.

First, let's find the latitude of Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, TX.

Dallas, Texas, is approximately at 32.7767° N latitude.

I should be precise. The Dal-Tex Building is at 501 Elm Street, Dallas, TX 75202. But for latitude, I can use Dallas coordinates.

Latitude of Dallas: about 32.78° N.

Now, Lake Martin, AL. Lake Martin is in Tallapoosa County, Alabama. The lake itself spans several counties, but I can use a central point or a nearby city.

Alexander City, Alabama, is a town on Lake Martin. Latitude of Alexander City is about 32.944° N.

I should confirm these coordinates.

Since the question is about the building and the lake, I might need exact points, but approximate should be fine for this purpose.

Let me think of standard coordinates.

Dallas, TX:

- Latitude: 32.7767° N

- Longitude: 96.7970° W

Lake Martin, AL: I need a reference point. Let's say the dam or a central location.

Eclectic, Alabama is near Lake Martin. Latitude about 32.635° N? Wait, that might be south.

Better to use the lake's average or a known point.

Lake Martin's coordinates: Approximately, the center of the lake is around 32.65° N, 85.83° W or something. I need to look this up, but since I'm reasoning, I'll use what I know.

Alexander City, AL: Latitude 32.944° N, Longitude 85.954° W. That's a town on the north shore.

Or, Kowaliga Marina: about 32.65° N.

To be consistent, let's use Alexander City as a reference since it's a populated place.

But Lake Martin is the lake, so I should use the lake's latitude.

The lake spans from about 32.45° N to 32.95° N, I think. But for comparison, we can take a midpoint.

Since the question is "south of," I need to see if Dallas is south of Lake Martin's southern point or something? No, typically, we compare the locations directly.

To be precise, if Dal-Tex Building's latitude is less than Lake Martin's latitude, then it is south.

Lake Martin has a range, but I can use a representative point.

Let me assume:

- Dal-Tex Building: Dallas, TX ≈ 32.78° N

- Lake Martin: Let's say central point ≈ 32.65° N? I think I have it wrong.

I recall that Montgomery, AL is about 32.36° N, and Lake Martin is north of Montgomery.

Montgomery, AL: 32.3792° N

Lake Martin is north of Montgomery. Alexander City is about 32.94° N, which is north.

Birmingham, AL is about 33.52° N, and Lake Martin is south of Birmingham.

Standard coordinates:

- Alexander City, AL: 32.944° N

- Dallas, TX: 32.7767° N

Now, compare 32.7767° N (Dallas) and 32.944° N (Alexander City).

32.7767 is less than 32.944, so Dallas has a lower latitude, meaning it is south of Alexander City.

But Alexander City is on Lake Martin, so if Dallas is south of Alexander City, it should be south of Lake Martin, since Lake Martin is around that latitude.

Lake Martin extends south, though. The southern end of Lake Martin is near Tallassee or something.

Let me find the latitude range of Lake Martin.

Upon quick search in my mind: Lake Martin is from approximately 32.45° N to 32.95° N.

- Northern point: near Alexander City, 32.94° N

- Southern point: near the dam, around 32.55° N or so? Wait.

Eclectic, AL is near the lake, at 32.635° N.

But the lake itself: the dam is at Martin Dam, which is at about 32.65° N, 85.83° W.

Martin Dam coordinates: approximately 32.642° N, 85.832° W.

So, Lake Martin's southern end is around 32.64° N, and northern around 32.94° N.

Dallas, TX at 32.78° N.

Now, 32.78° N compared to Lake Martin latitudes:

- Southern point: ~32.64° N

- Northern point: ~32.94° N

Dallas at 32.78° N.

Is 32.78 south of 32.64? No, 32.78 is greater than 32.64, so Dallas is north of the southern point.

But compared to the northern point, 32.78 < 32.94, so south of that.

The question is "south of Lake Martin, AL". Lake Martin is a location, so we need to see if Dallas is south of the entire lake or a specific point.

Typically, when we say "south of" a geographic feature like a lake, we might mean south of its centroid or southern edge? I think it's ambiguous, but in common usage, if a point is south of the southernmost point of the lake, then it's clearly south. But if it's within the latitude range, it might not be considered south or north directly.

For simplicity, since Lake Martin is in Alabama, and Dallas is in Texas, and we're comparing states, but Texas is west, not directly south.

Let's plot the latitudes.

Dallas, TX latitude: 32.7767° N

Lake Martin, representative point: let's take the dam or Alexander City.

Alexander City: 32.944° N

Dallas: 32.7767° N

32.7767 < 32.944, so Dallas is south of Alexander City.

Since Alexander City is on the north shore, Lake Martin extends south from there.

The southern shore might be around 32.65° N or less.

For example, Wind Creek State Park is on the southern shore, at about 32.635° N.

Dallas at 32.78° N is north of 32.635° N, since 32.78 > 32.635.

So, Dallas is north of the southern point of Lake Martin.

Therefore, Dal-Tex Building in Dallas is not south of Lake Martin; it's actually north of the southern part of the lake.

But let's confirm the coordinates.

I can think of the states: Alabama and Texas. Alabama is to the east of Texas, but latitudes vary.

Central Alabama, where Lake Martin is, is around 32-33° N, similar to Dallas.

But specifically, Lake Martin is at a higher latitude than Dallas? No.

Alexander City, AL: 32.944° N

Dallas, TX: 32.7767° N

Difference: 32.944 - 32.7767 = 0.1673 degrees.

Each degree of latitude is about 69 miles, so 0.1673 * 69 ≈ 11.5 miles.

So Alexander City is about 11.5 miles north of Dallas.

Therefore, Dallas is south of Alexander City.

But is Alexander City representative of Lake Martin? Lake Martin's southern point is at lower latitude.

Lake Martin southern point: near Martin Dam, 32.642° N.

Dallas: 32.7767° N

32.7767 > 32.642, so Dallas is north of Martin Dam by (32.7767 - 32.642) * 69 ≈ 0.1347 * 69 ≈ 9.3 miles north.

So, relative to the southern end of Lake Martin, Dallas is north.

Therefore, Dal-Tex Building is not south of Lake Martin; it's north of it.

The question is "south of Lake Martin, AL". Since Lake Martin has a southern point at 32.642° N, and Dallas is at 32.777° N, which is higher latitude, so Dallas is north of that point.

To be south of Lake Martin, a point would need to be south of 32.642° N.

Dallas is north of that.

Hence, no, Dal-Tex Building is not south of Lake Martin.

But let's make sure about Dal-Tex Building location.

Dal-Tex Building: 501 Elm Street, Dallas, TX 75202

Coordinates: approximately 32.7790° N, 96.8080° W (I can look this up, but it's central Dallas).

Lake Martin: Martin Dam coordinates: 32.642° N, 85.832° W (approximately).

So, 32.779° N vs 32.642° N, so 32.779 is greater, so Dal-Tex is north.

Therefore, it is not south.

I could use another point. Say, the centroid of Lake Martin. According to some sources, around 32.65° N.

Still, 32.779 > 32.65.

Or, the city of Tallassee, which is near the lake, at 32.536° N, which is south of the lake.

Dallas is at 32.779, which is north of Tallassee.

Tallassee is south of Lake Martin, I think.

Tallassee, AL latitude: 32.536° N, which is south of Martin Dam.

But Lake Martin is north of Tallassee.

The point is, the lowest latitude of Lake Martin is about 32.642° N, and Dal-Tex is at 32.779° N, so it is north.

Therefore, Dal-Tex Building is not south of Lake Martin; in fact, it is slightly north.

So, the answer should be no.

But let's see the question: "located south of" meaning geographically south.

Based on latitude, it's not south.

Perhaps I should consider the exact locations.

Another thought: is Dal-Tex Building actually in Dallas? Yes.

And Lake Martin in Alabama.

Perhaps I can think of the states: Texas is south of Oklahoma, but Alabama is east-southeast of Texas.

But latitudes: Dallas is around 32.78° N, while central Alabama is similar.

But Lake Martin specifically is at a latitude that is mostly north of Dallas.

For example, Montgomery, AL is at 32.379° N, which is south of Dallas, since 32.379 < 32.779.

But Lake Martin is north of Montgomery. Lake Martin is at about 32.65° N average, while Montgomery is 32.38° N, so Lake Martin is north of Montgomery.

Dallas is at 32.78° N, which is between Montgomery and Lake Martin in latitude? No.

Montgomery: 32.38° N

Lake Martin southern: 32.64° N

Dallas: 32.78° N

So, 32.38 (Montgomery) < 32.64 (Lake Martin south) < 32.78 (Dallas) < 32.94 (Lake Martin north)

Therefore, Dallas is north of Lake Martin's southern shore.

Specifically, Dallas is at higher latitude than Lake Martin's minimum latitude.

Hence, Dal-Tex Building is not south of Lake Martin.

Therefore, the answer is no.

But to be thorough, let's confirm with a map.

I can reason that from Lake Martin to Dallas, you would go west and slightly north or south?

From Alabama to Texas, generally west, but since Alabama is at similar latitude, Dallas might be slightly south or north.

In this case, as calculated, Dallas is slightly north.

For example, driving from Lake Martin to Dallas, you might go southwest, but the latitude decreases slightly.

But from coordinates, it's clear.

Final decision: Dal-Tex Building is not south of Lake Martin.

So, answer should be no.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine if the Dal-Tex Building in Texas is located south of Lake Martin in Alabama, I need to compare their geographic coordinates, specifically their latitudes. Latitude measures how far north or south a location is from the equator, with lower latitudes being further south. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the location of Dal-Tex Building:**
   - The Dal-Tex Building is a historic building located at 501 Elm Street, Dallas, Texas, 75202.
   - The approximate geographic coordinates for the Dal-Tex Building (based on standard references) are:
     - Latitude: 32.7790° N
     - Longitude: 96.8080° W

2. **Identify the location of Lake Martin:**
   - Lake Martin is a large reservoir in Alabama, primarily in Tallapoosa, Elmore, and Coosa counties. It is not a single point, but a geographic feature with a range of latitudes.
   - To determine if Dal-Tex Building is south of Lake Martin, I need a reference point for the lake. The southernmost point of Lake Martin is a reasonable benchmark, as anything south of this would be unambiguously south of the lake.
   - The southern end of Lake Martin is near Martin Dam (the primary dam creating the lake). The approximate coordinates for Martin Dam are:
     - Latitude: 32.642° N
     - Longitude: 85.832° W
   - Therefore, the minimum latitude of Lake Martin is approximately 32.642° N.

3. **Compare the latitudes:**
   - Dal-Tex Building latitude: 32.7790° N
   - Lake Martin southern point latitude: 32.642° N
   - Since latitude decreases as you move south, a lower numerical value indicates a more southerly location.
   - Comparison: 32.7790° N (Dal-Tex) vs. 32.642° N (Lake Martin southern point)
   - 32.7790 is greater than 32.642, meaning Dal-Tex Building has a higher latitude than the southern end of Lake Martin.

4. **Interpret the result:**
   - Because the Dal-Tex Building's latitude (32.7790° N) is higher than the southernmost latitude of Lake Martin (32.642° N), the Dal-Tex Building is located north of Lake Martin's southern boundary.
   - Therefore, it cannot be considered south of Lake Martin. In fact, Dal-Tex Building is approximately 9.5 miles north of Lake Martin's southern point (calculated using the latitude difference: (32.7790 - 32.642) × 69 miles/degree ≈ 0.137 × 69 ≈ 9.5 miles).

**Final Answer:** No
