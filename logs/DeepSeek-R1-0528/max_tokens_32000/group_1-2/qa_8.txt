*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine the birth years of Alfonso of Molina and Yao Shu to compare them. The question is whether Alfonso of Molina was born earlier than Yao Shu.

Let me start with Alfonso of Molina. I know he was a historical figure, probably related to Spanish royalty. Alfonso of Molina might be Alfonso, Prince of Molina. I think he was the son of King Alfonso IX of León. Let me recall his birth year. I believe Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202. I should confirm that.

Actually, Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202. He was the son of Alfonso IX of León and Berengaria of Castile. Yes, that sounds right. So, birth year: 1202.

Now, Yao Shu. That sounds like a Chinese name. Yao Shu might be a historical figure from Chinese history. I think Yao Shu was a chancellor during the Yuan Dynasty or something similar. Let me think.

Yao Shu (姚枢) was a Chinese statesman and scholar who lived during the Jin Dynasty and later served under the Mongol Empire. He was born in 1203. I need to be precise.

Upon second thought, Yao Shu was born in 1201 or 1203? I think I have it. Yao Shu was born in 1203. Let me confirm.

I recall that Yao Shu was born in 1203 and died in 1280. Yes, that seems familiar. He was a key advisor to Kublai Khan.

But let me double-check to be sure.

Now, comparing the two:

- Alfonso of Molina: born 1202

- Yao Shu: born 1203

So, if Alfonso was born in 1202 and Yao Shu in 1203, then Alfonso was born earlier.

But is this accurate? I need to make sure about the birth years.

Let me think about Alfonso of Molina again. Alfonso of Molina was also known as Alfonso de León or something. He was born in 1202, and he died in 1272. I think that's standard.

For Yao Shu, I'm a bit less certain. Let me try to recall. Yao Shu was born in 1203 in Luancheng, Hebei, during the Jin Dynasty. Yes, 1203.

Perhaps I should think if there's any discrepancy.

Another thing: sometimes historical figures have different birth years listed, but I think for these two, it's fairly consistent.

Alfonso of Molina: I can think of him as the infante of León and Castile. Born 1202.

Yao Shu: Chinese scholar, born 1203.

So, 1202 is before 1203, so Alfonso was born earlier.

The question is to show step-by-step reasoning, so I should outline this.

Step 1: Identify Alfonso of Molina's birth year.

- Alfonso of Molina, also known as Alfonso de León, was a prince of the Kingdom of León. He was born in 1202.

Step 2: Identify Yao Shu's birth year.

- Yao Shu was a Chinese statesman and Confucian scholar during the Jin and Yuan dynasties. He was born in 1203.

Step 3: Compare the birth years.

- Alfonso born 1202

- Yao Shu born 1203

- Since 1202 is earlier than 1203, Alfonso of Molina was born earlier than Yao Shu.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

But is Yao Shu's birth year definitely 1203? I recall that some sources might say 1201 or something. Let me think again.

Upon second thought, I remember that Yao Shu was born in the third year of the Jiatai era, which is 1203. Yes.

Similarly, Alfonso of Molina: born in 1202, as the second son of Alfonso IX.

I think I'm confident with that.

Final answer: Yes, Alfonso of Molina was born earlier than Yao Shu.
