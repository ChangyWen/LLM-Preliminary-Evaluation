*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Lake Vico located west of Pragser Wildsee?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to know where these lakes are located. Let me recall:

- Pragser Wildsee: I think this is in Italy. I remember that Pragser Wildsee is also known as Lago di Braies, which is in the Dolomites in South Tyrol, Italy. It's a popular tourist spot.

- Lake Vico: I believe this is also in Italy. Lake Vico is a volcanic lake in the Lazio region, near Rome. Yes, it's in central Italy.

Now, since both are in Italy, I need to figure out their relative positions. Specifically, is Lake Vico west of Pragser Wildsee?

Let me think about the geography of Italy. Italy is a boot-shaped peninsula, with the northern part being more Alpine and the central part being where Rome is.

Pragser Wildsee (Lago di Braies) is in the far north of Italy, in the Trentino-Alto Adige/South Tyrol region. That's close to the Austrian border.

Lake Vico is in central Italy, in the Lazio region, which is west-central, near Rome.

So, if Pragser Wildsee is in the north and Lake Vico is in central Italy, which is south of the north, but I need the east-west direction.

Italy runs roughly north-south, with the west coast facing the Tyrrhenian Sea and the east coast facing the Adriatic Sea.

Rome and Lazio are on the west side of Italy. Lake Vico is about 50 km north of Rome, but still in Lazio, so it's on the western side.

Pragser Wildsee is in the Dolomites, which are in the northeastern part of Italy. South Tyrol is in the north, near the eastern border.

Let me confirm the coordinates roughly:

- Pragser Wildsee: I think it's around 46.7°N, 12.1°E or something like that. I should look this up, but since I'm reasoning, I'll use general knowledge.

Actually, as an AI, I have access to geographical data, but for this exercise, I'll reason step by step.

From memory:

- Pragser Wildsee (Lago di Braies): Located in South Tyrol, which is in the northern part of Italy, east of the center. Coordinates approximately 46.694°N, 12.085°E.

- Lake Vico (Lago di Vico): Located in Lazio, central Italy. Coordinates approximately 42.32°N, 12.17°E.

Now, comparing longitude:

Longitude measures east-west, with higher values being more east.

Pragser Wildsee: ~12.085°E

Lake Vico: ~12.17°E

Lake Vico has a slightly higher longitude? 12.17 vs 12.085, so 12.17 is greater, meaning it's more east.

But longitude: as you go east, longitude increases.

So, Pragser Wildsee at 12.085°E, Lake Vico at 12.17°E, so Lake Vico is east of Pragser Wildsee because 12.17 > 12.085.

If Lake Vico is east, then it cannot be west. The question is if it's west.

West would mean smaller longitude.

Let me calculate the difference:

12.17 - 12.085 = 0.085 degrees, which is about 9.4 km east, since one degree of longitude is about 111 km at the equator, but in Italy, latitude is around 46°N and 42°N, so cosine effect.

At 46°N, cosine(46) ≈ 0.6947, so one degree longitude is about 111 * 0.6947 ≈ 77 km.

Similarly, at 42°N, cosine(42) ≈ 0.7431, so about 82.5 km.

But roughly, 0.085 degrees difference.

At Pragser Wildsee latitude (46.7°N), longitude degree is about 111 * cos(46.7) ≈ 111 * 0.685 ≈ 76 km per degree.

So 0.085 * 76 ≈ 6.46 km east.

Similarly, at Lake Vico latitude (42.3°N), cos(42.3)≈0.738, 111*0.738≈82.1 km/deg, 0.085*82.1≈7 km east.

So Lake Vico is about 6-7 km east of Pragser Wildsee in longitude.

But longitude is the measure; since both are around 12°E, but Pragser is 12.085, Vico is 12.17, so Vico is east.

Therefore, Lake Vico is not west; it's slightly east.

But let's double-check the coordinates to be sure.

I should confirm the exact locations.

Pragser Wildsee: Also known as Lake Braies, in South Tyrol, Italy. Coordinates: 46.6940°N, 12.0850°E (I think that's standard).

Lake Vico: In Lazio, Italy. Coordinates: 42.3200°N, 12.1700°E approximately.

Yes, so longitude: Pragser 12.085°E, Vico 12.170°E. So Vico is east of Pragser.

Therefore, Lake Vico is not west of Pragser Wildsee; it's slightly east.

The question is "west of", so since Vico is east, it is not west.

But let's think about the map.

Italy is oriented northwest to southeast, but generally, north-south.

Northern Italy, South Tyrol is in the northeast, near Austria.

Central Italy, Lazio is more towards the west coast.

Rome is on the west side.

Pragser Wildsee is in the Alps, which are in the north, but South Tyrol is east of Lombardy, for example.

For instance, Milan is around 9°E, Venice around 12°E, so South Tyrol is east of Milan.

Lake Vico is near Rome, which is around 12.5°E, but Rome is 12.486°E, Lake Vico is about 12.17°E, which is west of Rome.

Rome longitude is about 12.5°E, Lake Vico is 12.17°E, so Vico is west of Rome.

Pragser Wildsee is 12.085°E.

So comparing:

Pragser: 12.085°E

Vico: 12.170°E

Rome: 12.486°E

So Vico at 12.17 is west of Rome (12.486) but east of Pragser (12.085).

12.17 vs 12.085, 12.17 is greater, so east.

Numerically, 12.170 > 12.085, so Vico has higher longitude, meaning further east.

Therefore, relative to Pragser Wildsee, Lake Vico is to the east, not west.

Hence, the answer should be no.

But let's make sure about the lakes.

Is there another Lake Vico? I think not; it's Lago di Vico in Italy.

Pragser Wildsee is definitely in northern Italy.

Perhaps I should consider the direction more carefully.

In terms of map, if I think of Italy, from north to south:

- Pragser Wildsee: far north, near the eastern border.

- Lake Vico: central, but on the western side.

Since Italy is not straight, but the longitude shows clearly.

Another way: the prime meridian is in Greenwich, so east longitude increases as you go east.

Pragser at 12.085°E is west of Vico at 12.170°E? No.

12.085 is smaller than 12.170, so Pragser has smaller longitude, so it is west of Vico.

Let's think: smaller longitude means further west if same latitude.

For example, a point at 10°E is west of a point at 12°E.

Similarly, Pragser at 12.085°E is west of Vico at 12.170°E.

Therefore, Vico is east of Pragser, so it is not west; it is east.

Thus, Lake Vico is not located west of Pragser Wildsee; instead, it is located east.

So the answer should be no.

The question is: "Is Lake Vico located west of Pragser Wildsee?" Based on this, no.

But let's confirm the names to avoid confusion.

Pragser Wildsee: yes, it's the German name for Lago di Braies.

Lake Vico: Lago di Vico.

Both in Italy.

Perhaps I should think in terms of regions.

South Tyrol (where Pragser is) is in the northeast of Italy.

Lazio (where Vico is) is in central Italy, on the western coast side.

So, from northeast to west-central, that would be westward? No.

If you go from South Tyrol to Lazio, you go south and west, but relatively.

Specifically, since South Tyrol is in the east-north, and Lazio is in the west-central, so Lazio is southwest of South Tyrol.

Let's see.

Cities: Bolzano, which is in South Tyrol, is at about 11.35°E, 46.50°N. Pragser Wildsee is near there, longitude 12.085, which is a bit east of Bolzano.

Bolzano is about 11.34°E, so Pragser at 12.085 is east of Bolzano.

Rome is at 12.486°E, 41.90°N.

Lake Vico is at 42.32°N, 12.17°E, so north of Rome.

But longitude: Rome 12.486, Vico 12.17, so Vico is west of Rome.

Pragser 12.085, which is less than 12.17, so Pragser is west of Vico.

Longitude: smaller value is west.

So:

- Pragser: 12.085°E → smaller longitude

- Vico: 12.170°E → larger longitude

Therefore, Pragser is west of Vico.

Hence, Vico is east of Pragser.

So, Lake Vico is not west of Pragser Wildsee; it is east.

Therefore, the answer is no.

Perhaps the question has a trick, but I don't think so.

Another thing: is Lake Vico in Italy? Yes. And Pragser Wildsee is in Italy.

Maybe someone confuses with other lakes, but I think it's clear.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the locations:

   - Pragser Wildsee (Lake Braies) is located in South Tyrol, Italy, at approximately 46.694°N, 12.085°E.

   - Lake Vico (Lago di Vico) is located in Lazio, Italy, at approximately 42.320°N, 12.170°E.

2. Compare longitudes to determine east-west position:

   - Longitude measures east from the prime meridian. A smaller longitude value is west, a larger longitude value is east.

   - Pragser Wildsee longitude: 12.085°E

   - Lake Vico longitude: 12.170°E

   - Since 12.170 > 12.085, Lake Vico has a larger longitude, meaning it is east of Pragser Wildsee.

3. Therefore, Lake Vico is not located west of Pragser Wildsee; it is located east.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations of both lakes:**
   - **Pragser Wildsee** (also known as Lake Braies) is located in the Dolomites of South Tyrol, Italy. Its approximate geographic coordinates are 46.694°N latitude and 12.085°E longitude.
   - **Lake Vico** (Lago di Vico) is a volcanic lake in the Lazio region of Italy, near Rome. Its approximate geographic coordinates are 42.320°N latitude and 12.170°E longitude.

2. **Understand how longitude determines east-west position:**
   - Longitude measures how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian (0° longitude). A smaller longitude value indicates a position farther west, while a larger longitude value indicates a position farther east.
   - Since both lakes are in Italy, we can directly compare their longitude values to determine their relative east-west positions.

3. **Compare the longitudes:**
   - Pragser Wildsee longitude: 12.085°E
   - Lake Vico longitude: 12.170°E
   - Since 12.170°E is greater than 12.085°E, Lake Vico has a larger longitude value than Pragser Wildsee.

4. **Interpret the comparison:**
   - A larger longitude means Lake Vico is positioned farther east than Pragser Wildsee.
   - Therefore, Lake Vico is east of Pragser Wildsee, not west.

5. **Consider geographic context (optional but supportive):**
   - Pragser Wildsee is in northern Italy, close to the Austrian border, which is generally considered the northeastern part of the country.
   - Lake Vico is in central Italy, near Rome, which is on the western side of the Italian peninsula.
   - Despite Lake Vico being in western Italy, its longitude (12.170°E) is still higher than Pragser Wildsee's (12.085°E), confirming that it is slightly east of Pragser Wildsee. This is because Pragser Wildsee is located in a more westerly part of northern Italy, while Lake Vico is in central Italy but at a longitude that places it farther east relative to Pragser Wildsee.

6. **Conclusion based on longitude:**
   - Since Lake Vico has a higher longitude value, it is not west of Pragser Wildsee; it is east.

**Final Answer: No**
