*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: Is Clackamas County, OR located north of Yamhill County, OR? I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I should recall where these counties are in Oregon. Oregon is a state in the United States, and it has multiple counties. Clackamas County and Yamhill County are two of them.

I think Clackamas County is in the northern part of Oregon, near Portland. Yamhill County is also in the northwestern part, but I need to be precise about their relative positions.

Let me visualize a map of Oregon. Oregon is roughly divided into regions: the western part has the Willamette Valley, which includes many populous counties.

Portland is in Multnomah County, which is in the northwest. Clackamas County is southeast of Multnomah County, I believe. Actually, Clackamas County is directly south of Multnomah County and east of Washington County.

Yamhill County is west of Washington County. So, if Clackamas is east of Washington, and Yamhill is west of Washington, that might mean Yamhill is west of Clackamas, but not necessarily north or south.

I need to think about latitude.

Let me list the counties in order from north to south or something.

I remember that the Columbia River forms the northern border of Oregon with Washington. Counties along the river include Clatsop, Columbia, Multnomah, etc.

Multnomah County is at the northern border, with Portland. Clackamas County is directly south of Multnomah County.

Yamhill County is to the southwest of Washington County, and Washington County is west of Multnomah County.

So, to compare Clackamas and Yamhill:

- Multnomah County is north.

- South of Multnomah is Clackamas County.

- West of Multnomah is Washington County.

- West of Washington County is Yamhill County, and then further west might be Tillamook or something.

But Yamhill County is not directly west; it's more southwest relative to Multnomah.

I should look at the cities or known landmarks.

For example, Portland is in Multnomah County. Oregon City is in Clackamas County, which is south of Portland.

McMinnville is a city in Yamhill County. Where is McMinnville relative to Portland? I think McMinnville is southwest of Portland, about 40 miles away.

Similarly, Oregon City is directly south of Portland, about 12 miles south.

So, Oregon City (Clackamas) is south of Portland, and McMinnville (Yamhill) is southwest of Portland. Therefore, McMinnville might be at a similar latitude or slightly south of Oregon City?

I need to check the actual latitudes.

Since I don't have a map, I can think about the counties they border.

Let me recall neighboring counties.

Clackamas County borders:

- North: Multnomah County

- West: Washington County

- South: Marion County

- East: Hood River County or something? I think it's more like Clackamas borders Multnomah, Washington, Marion, and Clackamas River area.

Yamhill County borders:

- North: Washington County? Or Columbia County?

I think Yamhill County borders Washington County to the east, Polk County to the south, Tillamook County to the west, and Columbia County to the north? I'm not sure.

Let's think: Columbia County is north of Washington County, and Yamhill is south of Columbia or something.

I should consider the coordinates.

I know that the latitude of Portland is about 45.5 degrees north.

Oregon City is at approximately 45.36 degrees north latitude.

McMinnville is at about 45.21 degrees north latitude.

I think McMinnville is slightly south of Oregon City.

Let me confirm: Portland is 45.52°N, Oregon City is 45.36°N, and McMinnville is 45.21°N. So yes, McMinnville is south of Oregon City.

Therefore, Yamhill County (with McMinnville) is south of Clackamas County (with Oregon City).

But the counties are large, so I need to compare the overall positions.

Typically, the county seats are used as references.

Clackamas County seat is Oregon City.

Yamhill County seat is McMinnville.

Latitude of Oregon City: approximately 45.357°N

Latitude of McMinnville: approximately 45.210°N

Since 45.210 is less than 45.357, McMinnville is south of Oregon City.

Therefore, Yamhill County is south of Clackamas County.

But the question is whether Clackamas is north of Yamhill.

If Yamhill is south of Clackamas, that means Clackamas is north of Yamhill.

Yes.

To be thorough, let's consider the county boundaries.

I recall that Yamhill County is directly west of Marion County and south of Washington County.

Clackamas County is east of Washington County and north of Marion County.

Marion County is south of both.

Clackamas County shares a border with Marion County to the south, and Yamhill County also shares a border with Marion County to the east.

Yamhill County borders Marion County to the east, and Marion County is directly south of Clackamas County.

So, since Marion is south of Clackamas and Yamhill is west of Marion, that means Yamhill is south and west of Clackamas.

Therefore, Clackamas County is both north and east of Yamhill County.

Specifically, it is north.

For example, the northern part of Yamhill County might be at a similar latitude to the southern part of Clackamas, but generally, Clackamas is north of Yamhill.

Looking at a mental map, the Willamette Valley runs from south to north, but counties are arranged such that from north to south: Columbia, Multnomah, then Clackamas and Washington, but Clackamas is east, Washington west.

Then south of Multnomah/Clackamas/Washington is Yamhill? No.

South of Washington County is Yamhill County, and south of Clackamas is Marion County.

Yamhill is not directly south; it's adjacent.

The order from north to south in the Willamette Valley:

- Northernmost: Columbia County (but not in valley core)

Core counties: Multnomah (north), then Washington and Clackamas at similar latitudes but Washington west, Clackamas east.

Then south of that, Marion County and Polk County, with Yamhill to the west of Marion.

Yamhill County is between Washington and Polk, so it is south of Washington and north of Polk.

Since Washington County is west of Multnomah and at similar latitude, and Clackamas is east of Multnomah at similar latitude, both Clackamas and Washington are north of Yamhill.

For instance, Hillsboro is in Washington County, at about 45.52°N, same as Portland.

Beaverton is similar.

McMinnville is at 45.21°N, so lower latitude.

Oregon City at 45.36°N, which is higher than 45.21°N.

Therefore, Clackamas County has a higher latitude than Yamhill County.

Thus, Clackamas County is located north of Yamhill County.

So, the answer should be yes.

But let me make sure there's no trick.

Is there any part of Yamhill County that is north of Clackamas? Unlikely, because Clackamas is further north overall.

For example, the northern border of Clackamas is with Multnomah, which is at about 45.5°N, while the northern border of Yamhill is with Washington or Columbia, which might be around 45.6°N or something, but Washington County's southern part is higher than Yamhill's northern part? No.

Columbia County is north, but Yamhill borders Washington County directly.

Washington County's latitude ranges from about 45.3°N to 45.6°N, but Yamhill starts around 45.2°N or so.

Similarly, Clackamas ranges from 45.1°N to 45.5°N, but Oregon City is at 45.36°N, and the northern part is higher.

The point is, the centroid or the county seat comparison shows Clackamas north of Yamhill.

Another way: driving from Portland to Salem. Salem is in Marion County. You go south through Clackamas County or through the valley.

Yamhill County is to the west, not directly on the way.

But McMinnville is southwest of Portland, while Oregon City is south.

So, yes.

Therefore, Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine if Clackamas County, OR is located north of Yamhill County, OR, I will use geographic references, including county borders, city locations, and latitude coordinates. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Key Locations**:
   - **Clackamas County**: Located in the northern part of Oregon, southeast of Portland. The county seat is Oregon City.
   - **Yamhill County**: Located in the northwestern part of Oregon, southwest of Portland. The county seat is McMinnville.

2. **Reference Latitude Coordinates**:
   - Latitude is a key indicator for north-south positioning. Higher latitude values are further north.
   - Oregon City, Clackamas County seat: Approximately **45.357°N**.
   - McMinnville, Yamhill County seat: Approximately **45.210°N**.
   - Since 45.357°N is greater than 45.210°N, Oregon City (Clackamas) is north of McMinnville (Yamhill).

3. **Compare County Borders**:
   - Clackamas County borders Multnomah County (which contains Portland) to the north. This places Clackamas County in a relatively northern position within the Willamette Valley region.
   - Yamhill County borders Washington County to the east and Columbia County to the north. However, Yamhill County is primarily south of Washington County and does not share a border with Multnomah County or Clackamas County directly.
   - Clackamas County is separated from Yamhill County by Washington County (to the west of Clackamas) and Marion County (to the south of Clackamas and east of Yamhill). This arrangement confirms that Yamhill County is generally southwest of Clackamas County.

4. **Regional Context**:
   - In the Willamette Valley, counties are roughly ordered from north to south as follows: Columbia/Multnomah at the northern edge, then Clackamas and Washington at similar latitudes, followed by Yamhill and Marion further south.
   - McMinnville (Yamhill) is about 40 miles southwest of Portland, while Oregon City (Clackamas) is about 12 miles south of Portland. This places Yamhill County at a lower latitude (further south) than Clackamas County.

5. **Conclusion from Data**:
   - Based on latitude comparisons and geographic relationships, Clackamas County is positioned north of Yamhill County. While county shapes are irregular, the overall centroid and key landmarks support this.

**Final Answer: Yes**
