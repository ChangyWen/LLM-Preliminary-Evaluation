*********************************** End of Inputs **************************************




*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: Is WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan located south of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan? I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Williamsburg and Hillman Houses are both in Manhattan, New York City. But Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. That might be a mistake in the question. Let me double-check.

Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Hillman Houses, I believe, is a public housing complex located in Manhattan, specifically on the Lower East Side.

The question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" and "HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan." But Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan; it's in Brooklyn. This could be a error in the question. Perhaps it's referring to something else, but I think it's a common mistake. Williamsburg is definitely in Brooklyn.

Maybe there's a part of Manhattan called Williamsburg? I don't think so. Let me confirm with my knowledge.

Upon second thought, Williamsburg is a neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn, New York City. Hillman Houses is located at 250 Grand Street in Manhattan, which is on the Lower East Side.

So, if Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, and Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, then Williamsburg is not south of Hillman Houses because they are in different boroughs. But the question specifies both as Manhattan, which is incorrect for Williamsburg.

Perhaps the user meant something else, or there's a misunderstanding. Let me read the question again: "Is WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan located south of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan?"

Since Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan, I should point that out. But for the sake of answering, I need to assume the locations as given or correct the error.

Maybe "Williamsburg, Manhattan" is a typo, and it should be "Williamsburg, Brooklyn" or something. But the question says Manhattan for both.

Another idea: Perhaps it's referring to the Williamsburg Bridge or something, but that's not a neighborhood. The bridge connects Manhattan and Brooklyn.

I think the user might be confused. Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, so it can't be "Williamsburg, Manhattan."

To answer the question, I need geographical locations.

First, let's find the location of Hillman Houses. Hillman Houses is a NYCHA public housing development located at 250 Grand Street, Manhattan, NY 10002. That's on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

Now, Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. Its approximate coordinates are around 40.714°N latitude, -73.961°W longitude.

For Hillman Houses in Manhattan, Grand Street is around 40.717°N latitude, -73.981°W longitude or something similar. Let me think.

Lower East Side is roughly between Houston Street to the north and Canal Street to the south, but Grand Street is south of Houston, north of Canal? No, Canal is north of Grand? I need a map.

Standard Manhattan geography:

- The southern tip is Battery Park.

- Going north, you have Financial District, Chinatown, Lower East Side, etc.

Lower East Side is generally south of Houston Street and north of Canal Street? No.

Actually, Canal Street is a major east-west street, and south of Canal is Chinatown, which includes parts like the area around Grand Street.

Grand Street runs east-west through Lower Manhattan. Hillman Houses at 250 Grand Street is near the Williamsburg Bridge, which connects to Brooklyn.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is directly east of the Lower East Side, across the East River.

In terms of latitude, since Manhattan is oriented north-south, and Brooklyn is to the east and south-east.

The latitude of Williamsburg, Brooklyn is about 40.714°N, while the latitude of Grand Street in Manhattan is about 40.718°N or so.

Let me confirm approximate latitudes:

- Battery Park: ~40.70°N

- Canal Street: ~40.718°N

- Houston Street: ~40.726°N

- 14th Street: ~40.737°N

Grand Street is between Canal and Houston, but Canal is at about 40.718°N, and Grand is a bit south, around 40.715°N? Let's think.

Actually, streets in Manhattan: from south to north, latitude increases.

- Wall Street area: ~40.707°N

- Fulton Street: ~40.710°N

- Chambers Street: ~40.715°N

- Canal Street: ~40.718°N

- Grand Street: Canal Street is at 40.718°N, but Grand Street is parallel and south of Canal? No.

In Lower Manhattan, the streets:

- North of Canal Street is Houston Street at 40.726°N.

Canal Street is at approximately 40.718°N.

South of Canal Street are streets like Worth Street, but Grand Street is actually in the Lower East Side and Chinatown area.

Grand Street runs east-west and is located between Broome Street to the north and Delancey Street to the south? I'm getting confused.

Let's look at a specific point: Hillman Houses, 250 Grand Street, Manhattan.

According to Google Maps or general knowledge, Grand Street at Clinton Street or near there.

Latitude: approximately 40.716°N.

Longitude: approximately -73.980°W.

Now, Williamsburg, Brooklyn: let's say the center or Williamsburg Bridge area. Williamsburg Bridge connects from Delancey Street in Manhattan to Williamsburg in Brooklyn.

Delancey Street is around 40.718°N, same as Canal roughly.

Williamsburg in Brooklyn: the neighborhood is centered around, say, Bedford Avenue and Metropolitan Avenue, which is about 40.714°N, -73.961°W.

So, latitude of Williamsburg, Brooklyn: ~40.714°N

Latitude of Hillman Houses, Manhattan: ~40.716°N

Since latitude decreases as you go south, 40.714°N is south of 40.716°N.

Therefore, Williamsburg, Brooklyn is at a lower latitude than Hillman Houses in Manhattan, so it is south.

But the question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" which doesn't exist. So I need to address that.

Perhaps the user meant the Williamsburg area in relation to Manhattan, but it's not in Manhattan.

Maybe "Williamsburg, Manhattan" is a misnomer, and it should be just Williamsburg, which is in Brooklyn.

For the purpose of the question, I think we have to interpret it as Williamsburg, Brooklyn, since that's the only Williamsburg.

Hillman Houses is definitely in Manhattan.

So, geographically, Williamsburg, Brooklyn is south of Hillman Houses, Manhattan because 40.714°N < 40.716°N.

But since they are on different landmasses, "south" might be relative, but in terms of cardinal directions, yes.

The East River separates them, but Williamsburg is southeast of Lower Manhattan.

Specifically, from Hillman Houses on Grand Street, going south would be towards the waterfront, but across the river, Williamsburg is slightly south.

Let's confirm with a map.

I recall that the Williamsburg Bridge connects from Delancey Street in Manhattan to Williamsburg in Brooklyn. Delancey Street is at about 40.718°N, and in Williamsburg, the bridge lands around South 5th Street or so, which is at a similar latitude, but the neighborhood extends south.

For example, the Marcy Avenue area in Williamsburg is around 40.708°N, which is south.

But generally, the core of Williamsburg is around 40.714°N.

Similarly, Hillman Houses at 250 Grand Street: Grand Street at Essex Street is about 40.716°N.

40.714°N vs 40.716°N, so Williamsburg is slightly south.

But is it directly south? Not exactly, since it's east-southeast.

But for the question "located south," it means at a lower latitude, so yes.

However, the key issue is that Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, so "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" is invalid.

Perhaps the user is referring to the Williamsburg section of the Lower East Side or something, but I don't think that's a thing. Williamsburg is exclusively in Brooklyn.

Another thought: there is a "South Williamsburg" but still in Brooklyn.

I think I should proceed by assuming that "Williamsburg, Manhattan" is a mistake, and it's meant to be Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and compare the locations.

So, to answer: Williamsburg, Brooklyn is south of Hillman Houses, Manhattan.

Final answer should be yes.

But let's make sure about Hillman Houses location.

Hillman Houses address: 250 Grand St, New York, NY 10002. Latitude: 40.7157° N, Longitude: -73.9803° W (approximately).

Williamsburg, say near Bedford Ave and N 7th St: 40.7142° N, -73.9610° W.

So, 40.7142° N vs 40.7157° N, so Williamsburg is about 0.0015 degrees south, which is roughly 167 meters south (since 1 degree latitude is about 111 km).

So, technically, Williamsburg is south of that point in Manhattan.

But Hillman Houses is on the northern part of Grand Street? Grand Street runs east-west, so all points are similar latitude.

Grand Street latitude is around 40.7157°N, and Williamsburg is at 40.7142°N, so yes, south.

Moreover, if we consider the bridge, the Manhattan side is at Delancey Street, which is about 40.718°N, and the Brooklyn side is at about 40.712°N for the landing, so definitely south.

Therefore, Williamsburg, Brooklyn is located south of Hillman Houses, Manhattan.

But the question says both are in Manhattan, which is incorrect for Williamsburg.

For the answer, I think I should say: Williamsburg is not in Manhattan; it's in Brooklyn. But if we consider the locations, then yes, Williamsburg is south of Hillman Houses.

Perhaps the user meant something else, like Williamsburg Bridge or a different place.

Another idea: maybe "Williamsburg" refers to a street or something in Manhattan, but I don't think there's a Williamsburg street. There is Williams Street, but not Williamsburg.

I think it's a error.

In the context of the question, I should provide the reasoning and correct the mistake.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Williamsburg is a neighborhood located in the borough of Brooklyn, New York City. It is not in Manhattan, so "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" is geographically incorrect.

2. Hillman Houses is a public housing complex located at 250 Grand Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

3. For the purpose of comparison, we can use the geographical coordinates.

4. Approximate latitude of Hillman Houses: 40.716°N

5. Approximate latitude of Williamsburg, Brooklyn: 40.714°N

6. Since 40.714°N is less than 40.716°N, Williamsburg is south of Hillman Houses in terms of latitude.

7. Therefore, if we ignore the borough mislabeling, Williamsburg is located south of Hillman Houses.

Final answer: Yes, but with the clarification that Williamsburg is not in Manhattan.

Since the question insists on both being Manhattan, it might be impossible, but I think the intent is to compare the locations.

Perhaps there is a Williamsburg Houses in Manhattan? Williamsburg Houses is actually a public housing project in Brooklyn, not Manhattan.

Williamsburg Houses is in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Hillman Houses is in Manhattan.

So, Williamsburg Houses would be in Brooklyn, and Hillman Houses in Manhattan.

But the question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" which might be a confusion with the name.

I think I should just go with the locations.

Final decision: Based on geography, Williamsburg (Brooklyn) is south of Hillman Houses (Manhattan), so the answer is yes.

But to be precise for the question as asked, since Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan, it's not located south of anything in Manhattan as part of Manhattan, but that's splitting hairs.

I think for practical purposes, the answer is yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the Locations**:
   - **HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan**: This is a public housing complex located at 250 Grand Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Its approximate geographic coordinates are 40.7157° N latitude, -73.9803° W longitude.
   - **WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan**: There is a critical issue here. Williamsburg is not a neighborhood in Manhattan; it is located in the borough of Brooklyn, New York City. The term "Williamsburg, Manhattan" appears to be a mislabeling or error. Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has approximate coordinates of 40.7142° N latitude, -73.9610° W longitude (using a central point like Bedford Avenue and North 7th Street for reference).

2. **Clarify the Mislabeling**:
   - Since Williamsburg is in Brooklyn and not Manhattan, "Williamsburg, Manhattan" does not exist geographically. For the purpose of this question, I will assume the intent is to compare the location of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to Hillman Houses, Manhattan, as this is the only logical interpretation. If "Williamsburg" was meant to refer to something else in Manhattan (e.g., the Williamsburg Bridge or a specific building), there is no commonly recognized "Williamsburg" neighborhood or area within Manhattan.

3. **Compare Latitudes**:
   - Latitude measures north-south position, with lower values indicating a more southern location.
   - Hillman Houses latitude: Approximately 40.7157° N.
   - Williamsburg, Brooklyn latitude: Approximately 40.7142° N.
   - Since 40.7142° N is less than 40.7157° N, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is at a lower latitude than Hillman Houses, Manhattan.

4. **Determine Direction**:
   - A lower latitude means a position further south. Therefore, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is south of Hillman Houses, Manhattan.
   - Distance calculation: The difference in latitude is about 0.0015 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is approximately 111 kilometers, this translates to roughly 0.17 kilometers (or 170 meters) south. This confirms that Williamsburg is slightly south of Hillman Houses.
   - Additionally, the Williamsburg Bridge connects Manhattan (near Delancey Street, around 40.718° N) to Brooklyn, with the Brooklyn side landing at a lower latitude (around 40.712° N), further supporting that Williamsburg is south.

5. **Consider Geographic Context**:
   - Hillman Houses is on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, close to the East River.
   - Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is directly across the East River to the east-southeast of the Lower East Side. While it is not directly due south, the latitude comparison shows it is south in terms of absolute position.

**Final Answer**: Yes, Williamsburg (Brooklyn) is located south of Hillman Houses (Manhattan), based on latitude. However, note that Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, so "Williamsburg, Manhattan" is incorrect. If the question strictly requires both to be in Manhattan, the answer would be invalid, but given the context, the comparison is valid.
