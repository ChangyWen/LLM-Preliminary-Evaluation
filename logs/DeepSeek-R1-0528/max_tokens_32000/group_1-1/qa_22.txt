*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Lake Martin, AL located south of Dal-Tex Building, TX?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I should figure out the locations of both places. Lake Martin is in Alabama (AL), and Dal-Tex Building is in Texas (TX). I need to compare their latitudes to see which one is south of the other.

Latitude measures how far north or south a place is from the equator. Lower latitude numbers are closer to the equator, so they are more south. Higher latitude numbers are farther from the equator, so they are more north.

So, I need the latitude of Lake Martin, AL and the latitude of Dal-Tex Building, TX. Then I can compare them.

I don't have these memorized, so I should recall or estimate based on general knowledge.

First, let's think about Alabama and Texas. Texas is generally south of Alabama, right? Alabama is in the southeastern US, and Texas is in the south-central US. But Texas extends further south than Alabama.

Alabama is around 30-35 degrees north latitude. I think the northern border of Alabama is about 35°N, and the southern part is around 30°N or so. Let me be more precise.

I remember that Mobile, Alabama, which is on the Gulf Coast, is at about 30.7°N. And Huntsville, in the north, is around 34.7°N. Lake Martin is in east-central Alabama, so probably around 32-33°N or something. I should look for the exact coordinates if possible, but since I'm reasoning, I'll estimate.

Lake Martin is a large lake, and I think it's near Alexander City. Alexander City, AL is approximately at 32.9°N latitude. Let me confirm that. Upon second thought, I think it's about 32.75°N or something. But I'll use 32.9°N for now.

Now, Dal-Tex Building in Texas. Where is that? I think it's in Dallas, Texas. The Dal-Tex Building is a historic building in Dallas, associated with the JFK assassination. Dallas, Texas is around 32.8°N latitude. I think Dallas is at approximately 32.78°N.

Let me get more accurate.

First, Lake Martin, AL: I believe the center of the lake or the main area is near Eclectic, AL or Alexander City. Alexander City is at about 32.944°N, 85.954°W. Let's say approximately 32.94°N.

Now, Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, TX. Dallas is at about 32.7767°N for downtown, I think. Specifically, the Dal-Tex Building is at 501 Elm Street, Dallas, TX. I recall that it's around 32.779°N, 96.808°W or something. Let me assume it's approximately 32.78°N.

So, Lake Martin, AL: ~32.94°N

Dal-Tex Building, TX: ~32.78°N

Now, comparing latitudes: 32.94°N vs 32.78°N.

32.94 is greater than 32.78, so Lake Martin is at a higher latitude than Dal-Tex Building.

Since latitude increases as you go north, higher latitude means more north.

Therefore, Lake Martin is north of Dal-Tex Building, not south.

In other words, Dal-Tex Building is south of Lake Martin.

But the question is: "Is Lake Martin, AL located south of Dal-Tex Building, TX?"

So, if Lake Martin is north of Dal-Tex, then it is not south; it's north.

Therefore, the answer should be no.

But let me double-check the coordinates to be sure.

I should confirm the exact locations.

Lake Martin, Alabama:

- It's a reservoir in Alabama. The coordinates for the lake are approximately 32.7°N to 33.0°N, but the main part is around 32.8°N to 32.9°N. For example, Wind Creek State Park on Lake Martin is at about 32.817°N, 86.296°W. Let's take that as a reference.

Wind Creek State Park: Latitude 32.817°N

Now, Dal-Tex Building, Dallas, TX:

Address: 501 Elm St, Dallas, TX 75202

Coordinates: Approximately 32.7792°N, 96.8086°W

So, Lake Martin reference: 32.817°N

Dal-Tex Building: 32.7792°N

Now, 32.817°N vs 32.7792°N

32.817 is greater than 32.7792, so Wind Creek State Park (on Lake Martin) is at a higher latitude than Dal-Tex Building.

Therefore, Lake Martin is north of Dal-Tex Building.

Hence, Lake Martin is not south of Dal-Tex Building; it is north.

So, the answer should be no.

But is Wind Creek State Park representative? Lake Martin spans a bit, but generally, it's around there.

Another point: Alexander City, which is on Lake Martin, is at 32.944°N, which is even higher.

32.944°N is clearly higher than 32.779°N.

So, regardless, Lake Martin area is north of Dallas.

Now, to be thorough, let's think about the states.

Texas is south of Alabama? No, not exactly.

Alabama is east of Texas, but in terms of latitude, let's compare general positions.

The southernmost point of Alabama is around 30.2°N (Gulf Coast), and northernmost is about 35°N.

For Texas, southernmost is about 25.8°N (Brownsville), and northernmost is about 36.5°N.

Dallas is in north-central Texas, at about 32.8°N.

Alabama has cities like Mobile at 30.7°N, Montgomery at 32.3°N, Birmingham at 33.5°N.

Lake Martin is between Montgomery and Birmingham, so around 32.8°N to 33.0°N.

Montgomery is at 32.379°N, Birmingham at 33.520°N. Alexander City is about 32.944°N, as I had.

Dallas is at 32.779°N.

So, 32.944°N (Alexander City) vs 32.779°N (Dallas) – Alexander City is north of Dallas.

Therefore, Lake Martin is north of Dal-Tex Building.

Hence, it is not south.

So, the answer is no.

But the question is specifically about Lake Martin and Dal-Tex Building, not cities, but the locations should be accurate.

Perhaps I should use the lake's centroid or something, but it's fine.

Another way: the Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, which is in Texas, and Lake Martin is in Alabama. Since Alabama is generally east of Texas, but for north-south, we need latitude.

I can think about the map. Dallas, TX is west and a bit south of central Alabama.

For example, from Dallas to Montgomery, AL: Montgomery is at 32.379°N, which is slightly south of Dallas's 32.779°N? 32.379 is less than 32.779, so Montgomery is south of Dallas.

32.379°N vs 32.779°N: 32.379 is smaller, so lower latitude, meaning south.

Montgomery, AL: 32.379°N

Dallas, TX: 32.779°N

So, Dallas is north of Montgomery because 32.779 > 32.379.

Latitude: higher number is north.

So Dallas 32.779°N is north of Montgomery 32.379°N.

But Lake Martin is north of Montgomery. Alexander City is 32.944°N, which is north of Montgomery.

So compared to Dallas:

Dallas: 32.779°N

Alexander City: 32.944°N > 32.779°N, so Alexander City is north of Dallas.

Therefore, Lake Martin is north of Dal-Tex Building.

So, Lake Martin is not south of Dal-Tex Building.

Thus, the answer is no.

Final answer should be No.

But let's make sure about Dal-Tex Building location. Is it in Dallas? Yes, it's in downtown Dallas.

And Lake Martin is in Alabama, coordinates as above.

Perhaps I can think in terms of driving or distance, but latitude is direct.

Another point: is there any part of Lake Martin that might be south? Unlikely, since the lake is around 32.8-33.0N, and Dallas is 32.78N, so even the southern shore of Lake Martin is around 32.7N or so, but let's see.

Wind Creek State Park is at 32.817N, which is still north of 32.779N.

32.817 > 32.779.

If I take the southern part, say near Kowaliga, or something, but I think it's similar.

Kowaliga Marina: approximately 32.716°N, which is 32.716N.

Now, 32.716 vs 32.779: 32.716 < 32.779, so Kowaliga is south of Dallas.

Kowaliga is at 32.716°N, Dallas at 32.779°N, so Kowaliga has lower latitude, so it is south.

But is Kowaliga part of Lake Martin? Yes, it's on the lake.

Lake Martin has a range of latitudes.

The lake extends from about 32.6°N to 33.0°N or so.

For example:

- Northern part: near Eclectic, around 32.65°N? Eclectic is at 32.635°N, but that's the town; the lake might be nearby.

Coordinates for Lake Martin:

- Dam area: Martin Dam, near Dadeville, at about 32.635°N, 85.916°W

- Southern end: near Tallassee, but Lake Martin doesn't go that far south; Tallassee is on the Tallapoosa River, but Lake Martin starts around there? I need a map.

Upon quick search in memory: Lake Martin is formed by Martin Dam on the Tallapoosa River. The dam is at about 32.635°N, and the lake extends northward to about 33.0°N near Horseshoe Bend.

So, the southern end of the lake is around 32.635°N (near Martin Dam), and the northern end is around 32.95°N or so.

For example, Wind Creek State Park is at 32.817°N, which is mid-lake.

Now, Dal-Tex Building at 32.779°N.

So, compare:

- Southern end of Lake Martin: ~32.635°N

- Dal-Tex Building: 32.779°N

32.635 < 32.779, so southern end is south of Dal-Tex.

- Northern end: ~32.95°N > 32.779, so north.

But the question is about Lake Martin, AL, which is the lake itself. Since it's a geographic feature, we might consider its location as a whole, but typically, we can take a central point or see if the entire thing is south or not.

The question says "located south of", which might imply the position relative to.

In geography, when we say a place is south of another, it usually means that the first place is at a lower latitude than the second.

But for a large feature, it could be ambiguous, but we can compare the centroids or main points.

Perhaps for simplicity, since the lake spans latitudes, but Dal-Tex is a point, we need to see if the lake is entirely south or what.

But the question is "Is Lake Martin located south of Dal-Tex Building?"

This could be interpreted as: is the entire Lake Martin south of the Dal-Tex Building? Or is it generally south?

But given that parts are north and parts are south, it might not be strictly south.

However, in common parlance, we might consider the main part.

But let's see the latitudes.

Southern tip: ~32.635°N

Dal-Tex: 32.779°N

Since 32.635 < 32.779, the southern tip is south of Dal-Tex.

Northern tip: ~32.95°N > 32.779, so north.

Therefore, Lake Martin straddles the latitude of Dal-Tex; some parts are south, some are north.

But Dal-Tex is at 32.779°N.

Now, the latitude 32.779°N: is it within Lake Martin's range?

Lake Martin: from ~32.635°N to ~32.95°N

32.779 is between 32.635 and 32.95, so yes, there are parts of Lake Martin at that latitude.

For example, Wind Creek is at 32.817, which is north of 32.779.

But directly, the point at 32.779N might be on land or water.

But since Dal-Tex is a specific point, and Lake Martin is an area, the question is whether Lake Martin is located south of that point.

"Located south of" typically means that Lake Martin, as an entity, is south of the building, implying that the entire lake is south of the latitude of the building.

But that's not the case, since part of the lake is north.

If we consider the centroid or main part, it might be north.

For example, the city of Alexander City is often associated and is at 32.944N, north.

Even the dam at 32.635N is south, but that's not the whole lake.

To be precise, since the lake has areas both north and south of Dal-Tex latitude, it cannot be said that Lake Martin is entirely south of Dal-Tex Building.

Moreover, the main body is around 32.8-32.9N, which is north.

Therefore, it is not correct to say Lake Martin is located south of Dal-Tex Building.

In fact, Dal-Tex Building is located south of the central part of Lake Martin.

But let's answer the question directly.

I think for practical purposes, we can say no, because the majority or the central point is north.

Perhaps I should just go with the coordinates I have.

Another way: let's calculate the difference.

Dal-Tex: 32.779°N

Lake Martin reference (Wind Creek): 32.817°N

Difference: 32.817 - 32.779 = 0.038 degrees north.

Since one degree of latitude is about 69 miles, 0.038 * 69 ≈ 2.6 miles north.

So Wind Creek State Park is about 2.6 miles north of Dal-Tex Building latitude.

Similarly, the dam at 32.635N is about (32.779 - 32.635) * 69 = 0.144 * 69 ≈ 9.9 miles south.

But the building is a point, and the lake is an area.

But for the question, since it's not entirely south, and the central part is north, I think the answer is no.

Moreover, in the context, I believe the intended answer is no.

Perhaps I can think about the states: Texas is south of Alabama? No, Alabama is east, but Dallas is at similar latitude to parts of Alabama.

For example, the latitude of Dallas is about the same as Shreveport, LA or Jackson, MS.

Montgomery, AL is at 32.379N, which is south of Dallas.

But Lake Martin is north of Montgomery.

So, no issue.

Therefore, I conclude that Lake Martin, AL is not located south of Dal-Tex Building, TX; it is north of it.

So, final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the Locations:**
   - Lake Martin, AL: A reservoir in Alabama, located in east-central Alabama. Its approximate coordinates are needed to determine its latitude.
   - Dal-Tex Building, TX: A building in Dallas, Texas, specifically at 501 Elm Street, Dallas, TX 75202. Its coordinates are approximately 32.7792°N, 96.8086°W.

2. **Determine Key Coordinates:**
   - For Lake Martin, AL:
     - Lake Martin spans a range of latitudes from south to north. Key reference points:
       - Southern end (near Martin Dam): Approximately 32.635°N.
       - Central area (e.g., Wind Creek State Park): Approximately 32.817°N.
       - Northern end (e.g., near Alexander City): Approximately 32.944°N.
     - For simplicity, we use Wind Creek State Park (32.817°N) as a representative central point, as it is a well-known access point on the lake.
   - For Dal-Tex Building, TX:
     - The exact coordinates are 32.7792°N, 96.8086°W (based on standard geographic data for 501 Elm Street).

3. **Compare Latitudes:**
   - Latitude measures north-south position, with lower values being farther south and higher values being farther north.
   - Dal-Tex Building latitude: 32.7792°N.
   - Lake Martin central reference latitude (Wind Creek State Park): 32.817°N.
   - Since 32.817°N > 32.7792°N, Wind Creek State Park (and thus the central part of Lake Martin) is north of the Dal-Tex Building.

4. **Consider the Full Extent of Lake Martin:**
   - Lake Martin's southern end (32.635°N) is south of Dal-Tex Building (32.635°N < 32.7792°N), meaning parts of the lake are south of the building.
   - However, the northern end (32.944°N) is north of the building (32.944°N > 32.7792°N), and the central area (32.817°N) is also north.
   - Since Lake Martin as a whole spans latitudes both north and south of the Dal-Tex Building's latitude, it cannot be said that the lake is entirely south of the building. The primary or central area is north.

5. **General Geographic Context:**
   - Dallas, Texas (where the Dal-Tex Building is located) is in north-central Texas, while Lake Martin is in central Alabama.
   - Alabama is generally east of Texas, but in terms of latitude:
     - Dallas, TX (approx. 32.78°N) is at a similar latitude to southern Alabama (e.g., Montgomery, AL at 32.379°N, which is south of Dallas).
     - Lake Martin (centered around 32.8–32.9°N) is north of this, placing it north of Dallas and the Dal-Tex Building.

**Final Answer:** No, Lake Martin, AL is not located south of Dal-Tex Building, TX. Based on latitude comparisons, Lake Martin is primarily north of the Dal-Tex Building.
