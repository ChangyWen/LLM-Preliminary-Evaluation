*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Pragser Wildsee located west of Lake Vico?" I need to figure out the locations of both lakes.

I know that Pragser Wildsee is a lake in Italy. I think it's in the Dolomites, in the northern part of Italy. Lake Vico is also in Italy; I believe it's in central Italy, near Rome.

Let me confirm the locations:

- Pragser Wildsee: Also known as Lago di Braies, it's in South Tyrol, which is in the northern part of Italy, in the Alps.

- Lake Vico: I think this is Lago di Vico, which is in the Lazio region, central Italy, northwest of Rome.

Now, to determine if one is west of the other, I need to compare their longitudes. Since Italy is oriented roughly north-south, west would mean a smaller longitude if we're thinking in terms of easting (east is higher longitude).

Longitude increases as you go east. So, a point with a smaller longitude is west of a point with a larger longitude.

I need the approximate longitudes of both lakes.

Let me recall:

- Pragser Wildsee (Lago di Braies): I think it's around 12 degrees East longitude. Let me be precise. I remember that the Dolomites are in northeastern Italy, so longitude should be around 11-12°E.

Upon second thought, Bolzano, which is nearby, is about 11.3°E. Pragser Wildsee is in South Tyrol, so similar longitude. Let's say approximately 12°E.

- Lake Vico: Lazio region. Rome is about 12.5°E. Lake Vico is north of Rome, so maybe around 12.2°E or something. I need better estimates.

I should look for coordinates, but since I'm reasoning step by step, I'll use my general knowledge.

Italy extends from about 6°E to 18°E, roughly. Northern Italy is around 7-12°E, central around 12-14°E.

More specifically:

- South Tyrol (where Pragser Wildsee is) is around 11-12°E. Let's say 11.5°E for Pragser Wildsee.

- Lazio region (where Lake Vico is) is around 12.0-12.5°E. Rome is 12.4964°E, and Lake Vico is about 50 km northwest of Rome, so slightly west of Rome. Therefore, Lake Vico should be around 12.2°E or less.

If Rome is 12.5°E, and northwest would be both north and west, so longitude should be a bit less than 12.5°E.

Similarly, latitude: Rome is 41.9°N, Lake Vico is at higher latitude, about 42.3°N, and slightly west.

I found online in memory: Lake Vico coordinates are approximately 42.32°N, 12.17°E.

And Pragser Wildsee: 46.69°N, 12.08°E.

I think I should use these.

But since I'm not supposed to look up, I'll reason with approximate values.

Assume:

- Pragser Wildsee: latitude ~46.7°N, longitude ~12.1°E

- Lake Vico: latitude ~42.3°N, longitude ~12.2°E

Longitude for Pragser Wildsee: since it's in the east of northern Italy, but South Tyrol is more central Alps, so longitude around 12°E.

Similarly, Lake Vico is west of central Italy, so longitude around 12.2°E.

But 12.1°E vs 12.2°E is very close. Pragser Wildsee might be slightly west.

Pragser Wildsee is near Bruneck or something. Let's think of cities.

Bolzano is about 11.3°E, and Pragser Wildsee is east of Bolzano? I think Pragser Wildsee is in Puster Valley, which is east.

Pragser Wildsee (Lago di Braies) is in the province of South Tyrol, and the coordinates are 46.694°N, 12.085°E. (I think I remember that.)

Lake Vico (Lago di Vico) is at 42.320°N, 12.170°E. (Approximately.)

So, comparing longitudes:

Pragser Wildsee: 12.085°E

Lake Vico: 12.170°E

Therefore, Pragser Wildsee has a smaller longitude (12.085°E) compared to Lake Vico (12.170°E), so Pragser Wildsee is west of Lake Vico.

Longitude: smaller value means west, larger means east.

So, 12.085 is less than 12.170, so yes, Pragser Wildsee is west of Lake Vico.

But let's confirm the coordinates to be sure.

I know that Lake Vico is in Lazio, and Lazio is west of the Apennines, while South Tyrol is north, but in terms of longitude, South Tyrol is around 11-12°E, and Lazio is around 12-13°E, so South Tyrol has smaller longitude, meaning it's west.

For example, Milan is about 9°E, Rome is 12.5°E, so northern Italy can be west of central Italy depending on the location.

South Tyrol is in the north, but it's not the westernmost; western Italy is around 7°E like Turin.

But South Tyrol is east of that, around 11-12°E.

Lazio is around 12-13°E.

So, 11-12°E vs 12-13°E, so South Tyrol (Pragser Wildsee) is west of Lazio (Lake Vico).

Specifically, from the coordinates: 12.085°E vs 12.170°E, difference is small, but 12.085 is west of 12.170.

Therefore, Pragser Wildsee is west of Lake Vico.

The question is: "Is Pragser Wildsee located west of Lake Vico?"

Based on this, yes.

But let's make sure about the names.

Pragser Wildsee is the German name for Lago di Braies, in Italy.

Lake Vico is Lago di Vico.

And both in Italy.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify locations:

   - Pragser Wildsee (Lago di Braies) is in South Tyrol, northern Italy.

   - Lake Vico (Lago di Vico) is in Lazio, central Italy.

2. Approximate longitudes:

   - Northern Italy, specifically South Tyrol, has longitudes around 11°E to 12°E.

   - Central Italy, Lazio, has longitudes around 12°E to 13°E.

3. More precise:

   - Pragser Wildsee longitude: approximately 12.085°E

   - Lake Vico longitude: approximately 12.170°E

4. Compare longitudes: 12.085°E < 12.170°E, so Pragser Wildsee has smaller longitude, meaning it is west of Lake Vico.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

But is the difference significant? Longitude difference of 0.085 degrees is about 9.4 km at that latitude, but since 12.085 < 12.170, it is indeed west.

For context, Rome is 12.5°E, so Lake Vico at 12.17°E is west of Rome, and Pragser Wildsee at 12.085°E is even further west.

12.085 is west of 12.170, yes.

To visualize: Italy runs from about 7°E in the west (near France) to 18°E in the east (near Slovenia). Northern Italy, like Milan, is around 9°E, Venice around 12°E, so South Tyrol is similar to Venice, around 12°E. Lazio is around 12-13°E, so yes, 12°E is west of 12.5°E.

Pragser Wildsee is at 12.085°E, Lake Vico at 12.170°E, so Pragser is about 0.085 degrees west, which is roughly 7 km west at that latitude.

But directionally, it is west.

So, I think it's clear.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine if Pragser Wildsee is located west of Lake Vico, I need to compare their geographic locations, specifically their longitudes. Longitude measures east-west position, with smaller values being farther west and larger values being farther east. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations of both lakes**:
   - **Pragser Wildsee**: Also known as Lago di Braies, this lake is located in South Tyrol, Northern Italy. It is situated in the Dolomites, a mountain range in the Alps.
   - **Lake Vico**: Also known as Lago di Vico, this lake is located in the Lazio region of Central Italy. It is northwest of Rome and part of a volcanic area.

2. **Determine approximate longitudes**:
   - Longitude is key for east-west comparison. I'll use known coordinates based on general geographic knowledge:
     - Pragser Wildsee: Approximately 12.085°E (based on its location in South Tyrol, near the town of Braies).
     - Lake Vico: Approximately 12.170°E (based on its location in Lazio, about 50 km northwest of Rome, which is at 12.4964°E; thus, Lake Vico is slightly west of Rome but still east of Pragser Wildsee's longitude).

3. **Compare longitudes**:
   - Pragser Wildsee longitude: 12.085°E
   - Lake Vico longitude: 12.170°E
   - Since 12.085°E is less than 12.170°E, Pragser Wildsee has a smaller longitude value than Lake Vico.
   - In geography, a smaller longitude means a location is farther west. Therefore, Pragser Wildsee is west of Lake Vico.

4. **Consider geographic context**:
   - Italy runs roughly north-south, with Northern Italy generally west of Central Italy due to the country's shape. South Tyrol (where Pragser Wildsee is) is in the north, while Lazio (where Lake Vico is) is more central and slightly farther east.
   - The longitude difference is small (about 0.085 degrees), which translates to roughly 7-8 km at this latitude. However, this is sufficient to confirm the west-east relationship.

**Final Answer**: Yes

Pragser Wildsee is indeed located west of Lake Vico based on their longitudes.
