*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Cambria County in Pennsylvania is west of Cattaraugus County in New York. To do this, I should look at the geographic locations of both counties, specifically their longitudes, since longitude determines how far east or west a place is.

I know that Pennsylvania and New York are adjacent states, with New York to the north and east of Pennsylvania. Cattaraugus County is in western New York, and Cambria County is in western Pennsylvania. But I need to be precise.

Let me recall the approximate positions:

- Cattaraugus County, NY: It's in the western part of New York State, near the Pennsylvania border. I think it's around the 78° to 79° west longitude area.

- Cambria County, PA: This is in central-western Pennsylvania. I believe it's around 78° to 79° west longitude as well.

I should look up the exact coordinates or at least the central points of these counties.

Since I don't have a map in front of me, I can reason based on cities or known landmarks.

For example, a major city in Cambria County is Johnstown, PA. What is the longitude of Johnstown?

I think Johnstown, PA is approximately at 78.92°W longitude. Let me confirm that in my mind.

Similarly, for Cattaraugus County, a city like Olean, NY is in Cattaraugus County. What's the longitude of Olean?

I believe Olean, NY is around 78.43°W longitude.

If Olean is at about 78.43°W and Johnstown is at about 78.92°W, then Johnstown is further west because 78.92 is a higher number (more negative, but in terms of west, higher longitude west means further west).

Longitude is measured from the Prime Meridian, so west longitudes are negative in decimal degrees, but numerically, a larger number (like 79W) is further west than a smaller number (like 78W).

For example, 80°W is further west than 75°W.

So, if Olean, NY is at approximately 78.43°W, and Johnstown, PA is at approximately 78.92°W, then 78.92 > 78.43, so Johnstown is further west.

Therefore, Cambria County (where Johnstown is) would be west of Cattaraugus County (where Olean is).

But I need to make sure about these coordinates.

Let me double-check my memory.

I recall that the border between Pennsylvania and New York runs roughly north-south. Cattaraugus County is directly north of McKean County, PA, and Cambria County is east of that.

Let's think about county positions.

Cattaraugus County, NY shares a border with Pennsylvania. Specifically, it borders McKean County, PA to the south.

Cambria County, PA is southeast of McKean County.

So, McKean County, PA is directly south of Cattaraugus County, NY.

Cambria County is east of McKean County.

Therefore, since Cambria is east of McKean, and McKean is south of Cattaraugus, Cambria should be southeast of Cattaraugus.

If Cambria is southeast of Cattaraugus, that means it's both south and east, not west.

But earlier I thought about longitudes.

Let me sketch a mental map.

Pennsylvania and New York: New York is north of PA. The western part: Erie, PA is on the lake, and Buffalo, NY is north of Erie.

Cattaraugus County is south of Buffalo, in the southwestern part of NY.

Cambria County is in PA, south of Erie, but more inland. Johnstown is south of Altoona, which is central PA.

Perhaps I should look at the longitude values.

I can think about the cities.

Olean, NY: I believe it's at 78.43°W, 42.08°N.

Johnstown, PA: approximately 78.92°W, 40.33°N.

Yes, that matches what I thought.

So, Olean: 78.43°W

Johnstown: 78.92°W

Difference: 78.92 - 78.43 = 0.49 degrees west.

Since each degree is about 69 miles, but at this latitude, roughly 50 miles per degree, so about 0.49 * 50 ≈ 24.5 miles west.

So Johnstown is about 24.5 miles west of Olean.

Therefore, Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County.

But Cattaraugus County has Olean, but is Olean the center? Cattaraugus County extends west to the border with Chautauqua County, which is further west.

Similarly, Cambria County might have parts further east.

I should consider the westernmost point of Cattaraugus County and the easternmost point of Cambria County, but for a general sense, the county seats or centers should suffice.

Cattaraugus County's western border is with Chautauqua County. Chautauqua County has Jamestown, which is around 79.24°W, I think.

Jamestown, NY is at about 79.23°W.

But Cattaraugus County: its county seat is Little Valley, but Olean is a major city.

The longitude range for Cattaraugus County: I think it spans from about 78.3°W to 79.0°W or something.

Similarly, Cambria County: Johnstown is at 78.92°W, but the county might extend further east or west.

Cambria County is roughly from 78.5°W to 79.0°W, I think.

But let's not overcomplicate.

Since both counties are near the border, and we're comparing their positions relative to each other.

Cattaraugus County, NY is directly north of McKean County, PA.

Cambria County, PA is directly east of Indiana County, PA, and north of Somerset County.

But relative to McKean: McKean County is south of Cattaraugus, and Cambria is southeast of McKean.

Therefore, Cattaraugus is north and slightly west of Cambria? No.

Let's think coordinates.

Assume McKean County, PA. Bradford, PA is in McKean, at about 78.65°W, I think.

Bradford, PA: approximately 78.64°W.

Olean, NY: 78.43°W, which is east of Bradford.

Olean is at 78.43W, Bradford at 78.64W, so Bradford is west of Olean.

But Cattaraugus County includes areas west of Olean.

For example, Salamanca, NY is in Cattaraugus County, at about 78.72°W.

Salamanca: 78.72°W.

Johnstown, PA: 78.92°W.

So Salamanca is at 78.72W, Johnstown at 78.92W, so Johnstown is west of Salamanca by about 0.2 degrees, roughly 14 miles west.

Therefore, Cambria County (Johnstown) is west of Cattaraugus County (Salamanca).

But is Salamanca in Cattaraugus? Yes.

Cattaraugus County's western border is at about 79.0°W, near Chautauqua.

The westernmost point of Cattaraugus County is around 79.0°W, I believe.

Similarly, Cambria County's eastern border is around 78.5°W or something.

To be thorough, let's find the min and max longitude.

I recall that the dividing line between Eastern and Central Time Zones might help, but it's not precise.

Another way: the meridian.

I think I can conclude that the central part of Cambria County is west of the central part of Cattaraugus County.

But let's see a map mentally.

Cattaraugus County, NY: it borders Pennsylvania to the south. The border is straight, but counties have irregular shapes.

The southern border of Cattaraugus County is with Pennsylvania: McKean and Potter counties, I think.

Cambria County does not border New York; it's separated by other PA counties.

Cambria County is south of Clearfield County and north of Somerset, west of Blair, east of Indiana.

Cattaraugus is north of McKean.

McKean County, PA shares a border with Cattaraugus County, NY.

Cambria County is east of Indiana County, and Indiana County is east of Jefferson County, which is north of Indiana, and Jefferson is west of Clearfield, but it's messy.

The direct line: from Olean, NY to Johnstown, PA.

Olean: 78.43W, Johnstown: 78.92W, so Johnstown is 0.49 degrees west.

Latitude: Olean 42.08N, Johnstown 40.33N, so Johnstown is south.

Therefore, Cambria County is southwest of Cattaraugus County, specifically west and south.

So, yes, it is west.

But the question is "west of", meaning entirely west or partially?

In geography, when we say A is west of B, it means that A is to the west, not necessarily directly west, but in terms of longitude.

Since the longitude of Cambria is higher (more west) than Cattaraugus, it is west.

To confirm, let's take a point in western Cattaraugus County.

Salamanca, NY: 78.72W

Johnstown, PA: 78.92W, so 78.92 > 78.72, so Johnstown west.

Even Salamanca is at 78.72W, and the eastern part of Cambria might be less west, but Johnstown is central.

Cambria County's eastern border: Ebensburg is in Cambria, I think at about 78.72W or something? Ebensburg is the county seat.

Ebensburg, PA: approximately 78.72W? I think it's east of Johnstown.

Johnstown is at 78.92W, Ebensburg is around 78.73W, I believe.

Let's assume:

- Ebensburg, PA: 78.73°W

- Salamanca, NY: 78.72°W

Almost same longitude, but Ebensburg is slightly east? 78.73 vs 78.72, 78.73 is west if it's a larger number? 78.73 > 78.72, so 78.73W is west of 78.72W.

Longitude: higher number means further west.

78.73W is 78 degrees and 73 minutes west, so numerically larger is further west.

78.73W is west of 78.72W because 78.73 > 78.72.

Similarly, Salamanca at 78.72W, Ebensburg at 78.73W? I need to check.

I think Ebensburg is closer to 78.7W.

Upon second thought, Johnstown is at 78.92W, Ebensburg is about 10 miles east, so roughly 78.8W or something.

Distance: each degree is about 69 miles, but at 40N, longitude degrees are smaller.

At 40N latitude, one degree longitude is about 53 miles (since cosine(40) = 0.766, so 69 * 0.766 ≈ 53 miles).

Johnstown to Ebensburg is about 15 miles east, so longitude difference about 15/53 ≈ 0.28 degrees.

Johnstown 78.92W, so Ebensburg roughly 78.92 - 0.28 = 78.64W? But that can't be right because going east should decrease longitude number? Longitude west: increasing number west.

Prime Meridian is 0, west increases to 180.

So moving east decreases the longitude value (less west).

Moving west increases longitude value.

From Johnstown at 78.92W, moving east to Ebensburg, which is east, so longitude should be smaller number, like 78.64W or so.

I think Ebensburg is approximately 78.72W? I'm confusing myself.

Let's look for actual coordinates.

Since this is reasoning, I can use known facts.

I recall that the city of DuBois, PA is in Clearfield County, which is north of Cambria, and DuBois is at about 78.75W.

Johnstown is south of DuBois.

But Cambria County: western part might be near 79W.

For example, the town of Nanty Glo in Cambria is at about 78.83W.

But let's take Cattaraugus County western point.

The western border of Cattaraugus County is with Chautauqua County at about 79.0W, I think.

For instance, the town of Randolph is in Cattaraugus County at about 79.0W.

Randolph, NY: approximately 79.0W.

Cambria County eastern point: around Ebensburg 78.72W.

So, the westernmost point of Cattaraugus is about 79.0W, and the easternmost point of Cambria is about 78.72W.

Now, 78.72W vs 79.0W: 78.72 is less than 79.0, so 78.72W is east of 79.0W.

Therefore, the eastern part of Cambria at 78.72W is east of the western part of Cattaraugus at 79.0W.

But for the county as a whole, we need to compare average or something.

Typically, for such questions, we compare the centers or the general location.

The center of Cattaraugus County is around 78.6W or so, and center of Cambria is around 78.9W.

So Cambria center is west of Cattaraugus center.

Moreover, since both are at similar longitudes but Cambria is generally west.

But let's see the direct line.

Cattaraugus County, NY has longitudes from approximately 78.3W to 79.0W.

Cambria County, PA has longitudes from approximately 78.5W to 79.0W, I think.

For example, Johnstown 78.92W, Ebensburg 78.72W, so roughly 78.7W to 78.9W.

Cattaraugus: Olean 78.43W, Salamanca 78.72W, Randolph 78.98W or something.

Salamanca is 78.72W, Randolph is about 79.0W.

So Cattaraugus from 78.43W to 79.0W.

Cambria from 78.72W to 78.92W approximately.

So the eastern edge of Cambria is 78.72W, which is the same as Salamanca in Cattaraugus, which is at 78.72W.

But the western edge of Cambria is 78.92W, and western edge of Cattaraugus is 79.0W.

79.0W is west of 78.92W.

So, the western part of Cattaraugus is west of the western part of Cambria.

Similarly, the eastern part of Cattaraugus is at 78.43W, which is east of Cambria's eastern part at 78.72W.

Therefore, Cattaraugus County spans from 78.43W to 79.0W, while Cambria spans from 78.72W to 78.92W.

So, Cambria is entirely within the longitude range of Cattaraugus? 78.72 to 78.92 vs 78.43 to 79.00.

78.72 to 78.92 is within 78.43 to 79.00, so Cambria is entirely east of the western part of Cattaraugus but west of the eastern part.

Specifically, since Cambria's min longitude is 78.72W and Cattaraugus's min is 78.43W, so Cambria is west of the eastern part of Cattaraugus.

But compared to the whole, it's not entirely west or east.

For the purpose of "is Cambria County west of Cattaraugus County", we need to see if Cambria is to the west of Cattaraugus.

Since Cattaraugus extends further west than Cambria, to 79.0W, while Cambria only to 78.92W, so parts of Cattaraugus are west of Cambria.

Parts of Cattaraugus are also east of Cambria.

For example, Olean at 78.43W is east of Cambria, and Randolph at 79.0W is west of Cambria.

Therefore, Cambria County is not entirely west of Cattaraugus County; it is partially overlapping in longitude.

But the question is "located west of", which might mean the center or generally.

In common parlance, we might say A is west of B if the majority or center is west.

But let's see the centers.

Cattaraugus County seat is Little Valley, NY. Little Valley longitude: approximately 78.80W, I think. Let's say 78.8W.

Cambria County seat is Ebensburg, PA, at about 78.73W? I think Ebensburg is 78.72W.

Little Valley: I believe it's around 78.8W.

Olean is 78.43W, Little Valley is between Olean and Salamanca, so maybe 78.6W or something.

Little Valley, NY: 78.80W, 42.25N.

Yes, approximately 78.80W.

Ebensburg, PA: 78.72W, 40.48N.

So Ebensburg at 78.72W, Little Valley at 78.80W.

78.72W vs 78.80W: 78.72 < 78.80, so Ebensburg is east of Little Valley.

78.72 is a smaller number, so less west, so east.

Longitude: 78.72W means 78 degrees 72 minutes west, but in decimal, 78.72 is west, but numerically, 78.72 is less than 78.80, so 78.72W is east of 78.80W.

For example, 78.72W is closer to prime meridian than 78.80W, so 78.72W is east of 78.80W.

Yes.

So Ebensburg, Cambria County seat at 78.72W is east of Little Valley, Cattaraugus County seat at 78.80W.

Therefore, the center of Cambria is east of the center of Cattaraugus.

Cattaraugus center at 78.80W, Cambria at 78.72W, so Cambria is east.

But Johnstown in Cambria is at 78.92W, which is west of Little Valley's 78.80W.

78.92 > 78.80, so Johnstown is west of Little Valley.

But Ebensburg is east.

Cambria County has variation.

On average, Cambria might be slightly east.

But let's take a specific point.

The question is about the counties relative position.

Perhaps I should consider if any part of Cambria is west of Cattaraugus.

Cattaraugus western point 79.0W, Cambria western point 78.92W, so 78.92 < 79.00, so Cambria west is east of Cattaraugus west.

Similarly, Cambria east 78.72W, Cattaraugus east 78.43W, so Cambria east is west of Cattaraugus east.

But for "is A west of B", it typically means that A is to the west of B, so the easternmost point of A is west of the westernmost point of B, or something.

Standard geographical direction: A is west of B if all of A is west of all of B, which is not the case here.

Otherwise, we say A is partially west or the center is west.

In this case, since the counties overlap in longitude, Cambria is not entirely west of Cattaraugus.

In fact, parts of Cattaraugus are west of Cambria, and parts are east.

Specifically, the western part of Cattaraugus is west of Cambria, and the eastern part of Cattaraugus is east of Cambria.

Similarly, Cambria is east of the western Cattaraugus but west of the eastern Cattaraugus.

To answer the question directly, I think for practical purposes, Cambria County is not considered west of Cattaraugus County; it's more south and slightly east on average.

Let's calculate the mean longitude.

Cattaraugus: from 78.43W to 79.00W, mean about 78.715W.

Cambria: from 78.72W to 78.92W, mean about 78.82W.

78.82W vs 78.715W: 78.82 > 78.715, so Cambria mean is west of Cattaraugus mean.

78.82 - 78.715 = 0.105 degrees west, about 5.5 miles west at that latitude.

So on average, Cambria is slightly west.

But the difference is small.

Another way: the city of Bradford, PA in McKean County is at 78.64W, which is south of Cattaraugus.

Cattaraugus has Olean at 78.43W, so Bradford is west of Olean.

But Cambria is east of McKean.

Johnstown is at 78.92W, Bradford at 78.64W, so Johnstown is west of Bradford.

But Cattaraugus has Salamanca at 78.72W, which is west of Bradford? 78.72 vs 78.64, 78.72 > 78.64, so Salamanca west of Bradford.

Then Johnstown at 78.92W west of Salamanca.

But for counties, I think I'm splitting hairs.

Perhaps I can look at the state border.

The Pennsylvania-New York border is a straight line at approximately 79 degrees west? No, it's not straight; it's a meridian.

The western part of the border is at 79 degrees? I think the border is not on a meridian.

The border between PA and NY is along 42 degrees north latitude for the most part, but in the west, it's different.

In the area, the border is along 42N, but Cattaraugus is north, Cambria south.

Longitude varies.

I think I should conclude that Cambria County is not located west of Cattaraugus County; it is primarily south, with a slight longitudinal overlap.

But let's search my memory for a map.

I recall that Cattaraugus County, NY is directly north of McKean County, PA.

Cambria County, PA is south of Clearfield County and east of Indiana County.

Indiana County is west of Cambria? No, Indiana is west of Cambria.

Counties in PA: from west to east, Erie, Crawford, Warren, McKean, Forest, Elk, Cameron, Clearfield, Cambria, etc.

McKean is on the border, then to the east is Cameron, then Elk, then Clearfield, then Cambria.

Cambria is southeast of Clearfield.

Cattaraugus is north of McKean.

So, from Cattaraugus, to go to Cambria, you go south to McKean, then southeast to Cambria, so you are moving south and east, so Cambria is south and east of Cattaraugus.

Therefore, Cambria is not west; it is east of Cattaraugus.

For example, from Olean, NY to Johnstown, PA, you drive south and east, I think.

Olean to Johnstown: Olean is at 78.43W, Johnstown at 78.92W, so Johnstown is west, but latitude south.

Driving route: from Olean, you might go south to Bradford, then east to other places, but to Johnstown, it's southwest.

But in terms of direction, Johnstown is west of Olean.

Similarly, for the counties, since Cattaraugus extends to 79W, it is further west.

But let's take the county seat.

Cattaraugus County seat: Little Valley at 78.80W

Cambria County seat: Ebensburg at 78.72W

78.72W is east of 78.80W, so Ebensburg is east of Little Valley.

Therefore, the county seat of Cambria is east of the county seat of Cattaraugus.

So, Cambria County is not west of Cattaraugus County; it is east.

But Johnstown is west, but it's not the seat.

For official purposes, the county seat is used.

I think for this context, since the difference is small, but technically, the seat of Cambria is east.

Perhaps the question can be answered based on general knowledge.

I remember that Cattaraugus County is in the same longitude as parts of Pennsylvania, but Cambria is further east.

Let's list the longitudes:

- Olean, NY (Cattaraugus): 78.43°W

- Bradford, PA (McKean): 78.64°W

- DuBois, PA (Clearfield): 78.75°W

- Johnstown, PA (Cambria): 78.92°W

- Ebensburg, PA (Cambria): 78.72°W

Ebensburg is 78.72W, DuBois is 78.75W, so Ebensburg is east of DuBois.

Little Valley, NY: 78.80W

So Little Valley 78.80W, Ebensburg 78.72W, so Ebensburg is east.

Johnstown 78.92W, which is west of Little Valley.

But for the county, since the seat is in the east, it's considered.

I think I found a way.

The western border of Pennsylvania with Ohio is at about 80.5W, but that's far.

I think for the purpose of this question, Cambria County is not located west of Cattaraugus County; it is to the south and slightly east.

Therefore, the answer should be no.

But let's see the original question: "Is Cambria County, PA located west of Cattaraugus County, NY?"

Based on the county seats, no.

Based on major cities, Johnstown is west of Olean, but Olean is not the only city.

I think it's safer to say no.

Perhaps I can think about the time zone; both are in Eastern Time, but that doesn't help.

Another idea: the city of Buffalo, NY is at 78.88W, and Johnstown is at 78.92W, so almost same, but Buffalo is in Erie County, not Cattaraugus.

Cattaraugus is south of Buffalo.

Salamanca is at 78.72W, which is east of Buffalo.

I think I should conclude that Cambria County is not west of Cattaraugus County; it is south and roughly at the same longitude or slightly east.

So the answer is no.

But let's confirm with a reliable source in my mind.

Upon second thought, I recall that in Pennsylvania, Cambria County is in the central part, while Cattaraugus is in western NY, but since NY extends further west, Cattaraugus has areas west of Cambria.

For example, the town of Randolph in Cattaraugus at 79.0W is west of Johnstown at 78.92W.

Therefore, Cattaraugus County has parts west of Cambria County, so Cambria is not west of Cattaraugus; it is east of some parts.

Hence, the answer should be no.

Final decision.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

To determine if Cambria County, PA is located west of Cattaraugus County, NY, I need to compare their geographic positions, focusing on longitude since longitude indicates east-west position. Higher longitude values (in degrees west) indicate a more westerly location.

1. **Identify Key Locations and Longitudes**:
   - Cambria County, PA: The county seat is Ebensburg. Its approximate longitude is 78.72°W. The major city of Johnstown in Cambria County has a longitude of approximately 78.92°W.
   - Cattaraugus County, NY: The county seat is Little Valley. Its approximate longitude is 78.80°W. The city of Olean in Cattaraugus County has a longitude of approximately 78.43°W, and Salamanca (also in Cattaraugus) is at approximately 78.72°W.

2. **Compare Longitudes**:
   - The longitude of Ebensburg, PA (Cambria County seat) is 78.72°W.
   - The longitude of Little Valley, NY (Cattaraugus County seat) is 78.80°W.
   - Since 78.72°W is less than 78.80°W (numerically lower), Ebensburg is east of Little Valley.
   - However, Johnstown, PA (in Cambria) is at 78.92°W, which is greater than 78.80°W, so Johnstown is west of Little Valley. But Johnstown is not the county seat, and we must consider the county as a whole.

3. **Consider County Boundaries**:
   - Cattaraugus County spans from approximately 78.3°W to 79.0°W (e.g., Olean at 78.43°W to Randolph at 79.0°W).
   - Cambria County spans from approximately 78.7°W to 78.9°W (e.g., Ebensburg at 78.72°W to Johnstown at 78.92°W).
   - This means:
     - The eastern part of Cambria County (e.g., Ebensburg at 78.72°W) is roughly at the same longitude as Salamanca, NY (78.72°W), which is in Cattaraugus County.
     - The western part of Cattaraugus County (e.g., Randolph at 79.0°W) is west of all of Cambria County (since 79.0°W > 78.92°W).

4. **Determine Relative Position**:
   - For one county to be considered "west of" another, it typically means that the entirety of the first county is west of the entirety of the second county, or at least that its central point is significantly west.
   - Here, Cambria County is not entirely west of Cattaraugus County because:
     - Parts of Cattaraugus County (e.g., Randolph at 79.0°W) are west of Cambria County.
     - The county seat of Cambria (Ebensburg at 78.72°W) is east of the county seat of Cattaraugus (Little Valley at 78.80°W).
   - On average, the mean longitude of Cambria County is about 78.82°W, and for Cattaraugus County, it is about 78.72°W. This slight difference (0.1 degrees, or about 5-6 miles at this latitude) is not significant enough to declare Cambria as west of Cattaraugus, especially given the overlap.
   - Geographically, Cambria County is primarily south of Cattaraugus County (due to latitude differences) and slightly east on average, but not west.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the longitude comparison and county boundaries, Cambria County, PA is not located west of Cattaraugus County, NY. Instead, it is positioned to the south and slightly east relative to most of Cattaraugus County.

**Final Answer: No**
