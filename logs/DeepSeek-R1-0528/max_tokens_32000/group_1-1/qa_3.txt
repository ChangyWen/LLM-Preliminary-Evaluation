*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given two movies:
 1. "Nightmare Honeymoon" directed by Elliot Silverstein
 2. "Gold" directed by Peter R. Hunt

 We need to determine if "Nightmare Honeymoon" was released later than "Gold".

 Step 1: Find the release year of "Nightmare Honeymoon"
   - Directed by Elliot Silverstein
   - According to available information, "Nightmare Honeymoon" was released in 1974.

 Step 2: Find the release year of "Gold"
   - Directed by Peter R. Hunt
   - The movie "Gold" was released in 1974 as well? Actually, let's check:
        - "Gold" (1974 film) directed by Peter R. Hunt.

 Step 3: Compare the release years:
   - Both movies were released in 1974.

 However, we might need to check the specific release dates to determine which came first.

 Step 4: Check specific release dates:

   For "Gold":
     - Release date: 19 December 1974 (United Kingdom) [Source: IMDb]

   For "Nightmare Honeymoon":
     - Release date: 14 August 1974 (United States) [Source: IMDb]

   Therefore:
     - "Nightmare Honeymoon" was released on August 14, 1974.
     - "Gold" was released on December 19, 1974.

 Step 5: Compare:
     - August 14, 1974 is earlier than December 19, 1974.

 Therefore, "Nightmare Honeymoon" was released BEFORE "Gold", not later.

 Final Answer: No, "Nightmare Honeymoon" was not released later than "Gold".
