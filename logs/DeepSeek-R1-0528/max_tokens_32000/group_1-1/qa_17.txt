*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine the relative locations of Yamhill County and Clackamas County in Oregon. The question is: Is Yamhill County north of Clackamas County?

I should recall where these counties are situated. I know that Oregon is divided into multiple counties, and I need to compare their positions.

Let me think about the major cities or regions in these counties to get a better sense. Clackamas County is part of the Portland metropolitan area. It's east of Portland and includes areas like Oregon City. Portland itself is in Multnomah County, but Clackamas is adjacent to it.

Yamhill County is to the southwest of Portland. It includes cities like McMinnville and is known for its wine country.

Now, to compare their latitudes: I need to figure out which one is farther north.

I remember that Portland is roughly at 45.5 degrees north latitude. Since Clackamas County is directly southeast of Portland, it should be around the same latitude or slightly south.

Let me think about the coordinates:

- Portland, OR: approximately 45.52° N, 122.68° W

- Oregon City, which is in Clackamas County, is at about 45.36° N, 122.60° W. So, that's south of Portland.

Now, for Yamhill County, McMinnville is a major city there. McMinnville, OR is at approximately 45.21° N, 123.20° W.

Comparing the latitudes:

- McMinnville, Yamhill County: 45.21° N

- Oregon City, Clackamas County: 45.36° N

45.36° N is north of 45.21° N because higher latitude means farther north.

So, Oregon City (Clackamas County) at 45.36° N is north of McMinnville (Yamhill County) at 45.21° N.

Therefore, Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County, not the other way around.

The question is whether Yamhill is north of Clackamas. Based on this, Yamhill is south of Clackamas.

Let me confirm with another point. What about the county seats or other references?

Clackamas County seat is Oregon City. Yamhill County seat is McMinnville. I think I have that right.

I could think about the overall position. Clackamas County is east of the Willamette River and includes parts south of Portland, but it extends southward.

Yamhill County is west of the Willamette Valley, northwest of Salem. Salem is the state capital, in Marion County, at about 44.94° N, which is south of both.

Salem latitude is around 44.9° N, which is less than both McMinnville and Oregon City, so Salem is south.

McMinnville at 45.21° N is north of Salem at 44.94° N, but south of Oregon City at 45.36° N.

Oregon City is north of McMinnville.

Therefore, Clackamas County (with Oregon City) is north of Yamhill County (with McMinnville).

So, Yamhill County is not north of Clackamas; it's south.

But let me make sure about the county boundaries. Counties can have varying latitudes.

For example, the northern part of Clackamas County might be at a higher latitude than the southern part of Yamhill, but generally, we compare central points or the overall position.

Looking at a map mentally: Portland is north, then to the south and east is Clackamas County. To the west and south is Yamhill County. So, from Portland, you go south to reach Clackamas areas like Oregon City, but Oregon City is still north of McMinnville.

Distance-wise: From Portland to Oregon City is about 15 miles south, and from Portland to McMinnville is about 40 miles southwest. So McMinnville is farther south.

Latitude difference: 45.52° N (Portland) to 45.36° N (Oregon City) is about 0.16 degrees south, which is roughly 11 miles south (since 1 degree latitude is about 69 miles).

Portland to McMinnville: 45.52° N to 45.21° N is 0.31 degrees south, about 21 miles south.

So McMinnville is farther south than Oregon City.

Therefore, Yamhill County is south of Clackamas County.

Hence, Yamhill County is not north of Clackamas County.

The answer should be no.

But let me double-check with another city.

In Clackamas County, there's also Sandy or Estacada, but Oregon City is a good reference.

The northern border of Clackamas County is with Multnomah County (Portland), so it can be as north as 45.6° N or so, but Yamhill County's northern border is with Washington County, which includes Hillsboro at about 45.52° N, similar to Portland.

Hillsboro, OR is at 45.52° N, 122.99° W, which is in Washington County.

Yamhill County is south of Washington County, so its northern border is around 45.3° N or something.

Clackamas County's southern border goes down to around 44.9° N near Mount Hood, but the populated part is higher.

But for comparison, the county seat latitudes are sufficient.

I can think of Interstate highways. I-5 runs north-south. Portland is on I-5, then south to Salem. Clackamas County is east of I-5, but Oregon City is near I-205.

McMinnville is west of I-5, on OR-99W.

But in terms of latitude, Oregon City is north of McMinnville.

I think I'm confident.

Final answer: No, Yamhill County is not north of Clackamas County; it is south.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine if Yamhill County, OR is located north of Clackamas County, OR, I need to compare their geographic positions, specifically their latitudes. Counties can have varying latitudes across their areas, so I'll use the county seats as reference points for a general comparison. The county seat of Yamhill County is McMinnville, and the county seat of Clackamas County is Oregon City.

1. **Identify the latitude of Yamhill County's seat (McMinnville):**
   - McMinnville, OR is located at approximately **45.21° N** latitude.

2. **Identify the latitude of Clackamas County's seat (Oregon City):**
   - Oregon City, OR is located at approximately **45.36° N** latitude.

3. **Compare the latitudes:**
   - A higher latitude value means a location is farther north.
   - Oregon City (Clackamas County) at 45.36° N has a higher latitude than McMinnville (Yamhill County) at 45.21° N.
   - Therefore, Oregon City (and thus Clackamas County) is north of McMinnville (and thus Yamhill County).

4. **Consider the broader geographic context:**
   - Clackamas County is part of the Portland metropolitan area and is generally situated east of Portland (Multnomah County). Its northern areas are closer to the Columbia River, while its southern areas extend toward Mount Hood.
   - Yamhill County is located in the Willamette Valley, southwest of Portland and northwest of Salem (Marion County). It is generally west of the Willamette River.
   - Based on standard maps and geographic data, the majority of Clackamas County lies north of Yamhill County. For example:
     - Driving from McMinnville (Yamhill) to Oregon City (Clackamas) involves traveling northeast, indicating that Clackamas County is both east and north of Yamhill County.
     - The latitude difference (45.36° N vs. 45.21° N) translates to a north-south distance of about 10-15 miles, with Clackamas County being farther north.

5. **Conclusion from the comparison:**
   - Since Clackamas County's reference point (Oregon City) is at a higher latitude than Yamhill County's reference point (McMinnville), Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County.
   - Thus, Yamhill County is not north of Clackamas County; it is south of it.

**Final Answer: No**
