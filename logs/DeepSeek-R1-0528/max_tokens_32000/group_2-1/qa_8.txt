*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the Sahara Desert hotter than the Gobi Desert?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I should recall what I know about these deserts. The Sahara is in Africa, and it's the largest hot desert in the world. The Gobi Desert is in Asia, covering parts of northern China and southern Mongolia. Both are deserts, but they might have different climate conditions.

The key factor here is temperature. I need to compare the average temperatures or the typical heat levels in these two deserts.

Let me think about the Sahara. It's known for being extremely hot. I remember that the Sahara has some of the highest recorded temperatures on Earth. For example, in places like Aziziyah, Libya, or Death Valley (though Death Valley is in the US, not Sahara), but Sahara has high temperatures. Average summer temperatures in the Sahara can be around 38°C (100°F) or higher, and it can get up to 50°C (122°F) or more in some areas.

Now, the Gobi Desert: It's a cold desert. I think it has more extreme temperature variations. Summers can be hot, but winters are very cold. I recall that in the Gobi, summer temperatures might reach 40°C (104°F), but winter temperatures can drop to -40°C (-40°F). So, on average, it might not be as hot as the Sahara year-round.

I should look for average annual temperatures or peak summer temperatures to compare.

Since I don't have real-time data, I'll rely on general knowledge from geography or climate studies.

Let me break it down:

- Sahara Desert:
  - Location: Northern Africa
  - Climate: Arid, subtropical desert
  - Average high temperature in summer: Around 38-45°C (100-113°F)
  - Record high: Over 50°C (e.g., 55°C in Kebili, Tunisia)
  - Low humidity, intense solar radiation.

- Gobi Desert:
  - Location: Central Asia, Mongolia and China
  - Climate: Cold desert, continental
  - Average high in summer: Around 30-38°C (86-100°F), but can be higher.
  - Record high: I think around 45°C in some parts, but not as consistently high as Sahara.
  - Winters are bitterly cold, with averages below freezing.

For the question "hotter," I think we're focusing on heat, so probably summer temperatures or average warm season temperatures.

The Sahara is generally considered hotter because it's at a lower latitude, closer to the equator, so it receives more direct sunlight year-round. The Gobi is at a higher latitude, so it has colder winters and less intense heat in summer.

I remember that the Sahara has higher average annual temperatures. Let me think about numbers.

From memory:

- Average annual temperature for Sahara: Around 30°C (86°F) in some parts, but it varies. For example, in Cairo, which is on the edge, it's about 21°C, but deep in the desert, it's higher.

Perhaps I should consider specific locations.

For comparison:

- Sahara: In Timbuktu, Mali, average high in June is about 41°C (106°F). In In Salah, Algeria, it can be hotter.

- Gobi: In Ulaanbaatar, which is near the Gobi, but not exactly, summer highs average around 24°C (75°F) for July, but that's the capital. In the Gobi proper, like in Dalanzadgad, Mongolia, average July high is about 31°C (88°F), and can reach higher.

I think the Gobi has areas where summer temperatures are high, but not as extreme as the Sahara.

Moreover, the Sahara holds the record for one of the highest temperatures ever recorded. For instance, according to the World Meteorological Organization, the highest temperature was in Furnace Creek, Death Valley at 56.7°C, but Death Valley is not Sahara. Sahara has recorded 55°C in Kebili, Tunisia.

Gobi's highest recorded temperature is around 45-50°C? I think it's less. I recall that the Gobi doesn't have temperatures as high as the Sahara.

Upon second thought, I think the Lut Desert in Iran has recorded high temperatures, but that's not Gobi. Gobi is colder.

Let me confirm: The Gobi is classified as a cold desert because of its temperature range.

So, overall, the Sahara should be hotter.

But to be thorough, let's consider the definition of "hotter." If we mean peak temperatures, Sahara is hotter. If we mean average annual temperature, Sahara is still hotter because Gobi has very cold winters.

For example:

- Sahara average annual temperature: Varies, but in central Sahara, it might be 25-30°C.

- Gobi average annual temperature: Around 2-8°C, I think, because of the cold winters.

Yes, that makes sense. So Sahara is definitely hotter on average.

Therefore, the answer should be yes.

But let's make sure there's no trick. Is there any part of the Gobi that is hotter than parts of Sahara? Probably not consistently. The Sahara is uniformly hot, while Gobi has variability.

Also, in terms of heat records, Sahara has higher extremes.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the deserts: Sahara in Africa, Gobi in Asia.

2. Sahara is a hot desert with high temperatures year-round in its core areas, especially in summer.

3. Gobi is a cold desert with hot summers but very cold winters, leading to a lower average annual temperature.

4. Compare peak summer temperatures: Sahara often exceeds 45°C, with records above 50°C. Gobi summer highs are typically 30-40°C, with occasional spikes but not as high.

5. Compare average annual temperatures: Sahara averages around 25-30°C in hot regions, while Gobi averages much lower, around 5-10°C in many parts.

6. Therefore, based on both peak and average temperatures, the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert. "Hotter" can refer to average temperatures, peak temperatures, or overall heat intensity. I'll consider both average annual temperatures and extreme summer highs, as these are key indicators for desert heat.

2. **Geographical and Climatic Context**:
   - **Sahara Desert**: Located in North Africa, it is the world's largest hot desert. It lies in a subtropical zone with high solar radiation, low humidity, and minimal cloud cover. This results in consistently high temperatures, especially in summer.
   - **Gobi Desert**: Located in East Asia (covering parts of Mongolia and China), it is classified as a cold desert. It experiences a continental climate with greater temperature extremes—hot summers but very cold winters due to its higher latitude and elevation.

3. **Compare Average Annual Temperatures**:
   - Sahara: The average annual temperature ranges from about 25°C to 30°C (77°F to 86°F) in its core areas. For example, in regions like Timbuktu (Mali) or In Salah (Algeria), averages are around 28-30°C.
   - Gobi: The average annual temperature is significantly lower, typically between 2°C and 8°C (36°F to 46°F). For instance, in Dalanzadgad (Mongolia), a central Gobi location, the average is about 5°C (41°F).
   - **Comparison**: The Sahara's average annual temperature is substantially higher than the Gobi's, primarily because the Gobi's frigid winters (with temperatures often dropping below -20°C or -4°F) pull down the yearly average.

4. **Compare Peak Summer Temperatures**:
   - Sahara: Summer highs (June-August) regularly reach 38-45°C (100-113°F), with record highs exceeding 50°C (122°F). For example, Kebili (Tunisia) recorded 55°C (131°F), one of the highest in Africa.
   - Gobi: Summer highs are generally lower, averaging 30-38°C (86-100°F) in July. While occasional heatwaves can push temperatures to around 40-45°C (104-113°F), these are less frequent and not as extreme as the Sahara's peaks. The highest recorded temperature in the Gobi is about 47°C (117°F) in some areas, but this is not the norm.
   - **Comparison**: The Sahara experiences higher and more consistent peak temperatures during summer. The Gobi's heat is moderated by its elevation (500–1,500 meters) and latitude, resulting in less intense solar heating.

5. **Consider Other Factors**:
   - **Latitude and Solar Insolation**: The Sahara is closer to the equator (spanning 15°N to 30°N), receiving more direct sunlight year-round. The Gobi is farther north (40°N to 50°N), leading to lower solar intensity and greater seasonal variation.
   - **Climate Classification**: The Sahara is a "hot desert" (BWh in Köppen classification) with persistent heat, while the Gobi is a "cold desert" (BWk) with harsh winters that reduce its overall heat profile.
   - **Historical Data**: According to sources like the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and climate studies (e.g., from NOAA or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), the Sahara consistently ranks among the hottest places on Earth, while the Gobi is known for temperature extremes that include severe cold.

6. **Conclusion on Hotness**: Based on both average annual temperatures (Sahara ~28°C vs. Gobi ~5°C) and peak summer temperatures (Sahara regularly >45°C vs. Gobi ~35°C), the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert. This holds true for most of the year, except during the Gobi's brief summer, when temperatures can be similar but still generally lower.

**Final Answer**: Yes
