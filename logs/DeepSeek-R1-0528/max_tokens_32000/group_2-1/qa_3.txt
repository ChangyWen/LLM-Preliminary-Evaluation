*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine when Albert Einstein died and when Isaac Newton died. Then, I can compare their death dates to see if Einstein died later than Newton.

Albert Einstein: He was born on March 14, 1879, and died on April 18, 1955. I remember that because he's famous for his theory of relativity.

Isaac Newton: He was born on January 4, 1643, and died on March 31, 1727. Newton is known for his laws of motion and gravity.

Now, I should confirm these dates to be accurate. Einstein died in 1955, and Newton died in 1727. That's a big difference.

Einstein died in 1955, Newton in 1727. So, 1955 is much later than 1727. Therefore, Einstein died later than Newton.

I should double-check the dates to make sure I have them right.

Albert Einstein: Death date is April 18, 1955. Yes, that's standard knowledge.

Isaac Newton: Death date is March 31, 1727. Also correct.

Since 1955 is after 1727, Einstein died later.

The question is: "Did Albert Einstein die later than Isaac Newton?" Based on the years, 1955 is greater than 1727, so yes.

But just to be thorough, let's think about the exact dates. Newton died on March 31, 1727, and Einstein died on April 18, 1955. Even if I compare the months and days, April 18 is after March 31, but since the years are so far apart, it's irrelevant. 1955 is definitely after 1727.

Another thing: sometimes dates are given in different calendars. Newton lived during the Julian calendar, but when he died, England was still using the Julian calendar, I think. The Gregorian calendar was adopted in different places at different times.

Newton died in 1727. Great Britain adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752. So, when Newton died, it was still the Julian calendar.

But for the purpose of this question, since we're comparing death dates, and Einstein died much later, the calendar difference doesn't matter. The year 1727 in Julian is still equivalent to 1727 in Gregorian for comparison purposes, as the offset is small.

The Gregorian calendar was introduced in 1582, but Britain didn't adopt it until 1752. So, Newton's death date is recorded as March 31, 1727, in the Julian calendar, which would be April 11, 1727, in the Gregorian calendar. But that's a minor adjustment.

Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in the Gregorian calendar.

So, if I convert both to Gregorian:

Newton: March 31, 1727 (Julian) is equivalent to April 11, 1727 (Gregorian).

Einstein: April 18, 1955 (Gregorian).

Now, comparing: 1955 is still much later than 1727. Even the day: April 18 vs. April 11, but again, the year difference overshadows it.

So, no issue.

Therefore, Einstein died later than Newton.

The answer should be yes.

Now, for the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall Albert Einstein's death date: April 18, 1955.

2. Recall Isaac Newton's death date: March 31, 1727 (Julian calendar).

3. Convert Newton's death date to Gregorian for consistency: March 31, 1727 (Julian) is April 11, 1727 (Gregorian).

4. Compare the years: 1955 vs. 1727. Since 1955 > 1727, Einstein died later.

5. Even comparing the full dates: 1955-04-18 is after 1727-04-11.

So, definitively, yes.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Albert Einstein's death date:**  
   Albert Einstein, the renowned physicist, died on **April 18, 1955**, in Princeton, New Jersey, USA. This date is well-documented in historical records.

2. **Identify Isaac Newton's death date:**  
   Isaac Newton, the influential mathematician and physicist, died on **March 31, 1727**, in London, England. However, this date is based on the Julian calendar, which was in use in England at the time (Great Britain adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752).

3. **Account for calendar differences (if necessary):**  
   - Newton's death date in the Julian calendar (March 31, 1727) converts to **April 11, 1727**, in the Gregorian calendar (used today). This conversion accounts for the 11-day shift between the Julian and Gregorian calendars.  
   - Einstein's death date (April 18, 1955) is already in the Gregorian calendar.  
   - For accuracy in comparison, both dates should be referenced in the same calendar system. Thus, we use:  
     - Newton: **April 11, 1727 (Gregorian)**  
     - Einstein: **April 18, 1955 (Gregorian)**

4. **Compare the death dates:**  
   - Compare the years first: 1955 (Einstein) vs. 1727 (Newton). Since 1955 is greater than 1727, Einstein died later.  
   - If needed, compare months and days: Both dates are in April (Einstein: April 18; Newton: April 11). April 18 is later than April 11.  
   - Therefore, **April 18, 1955**, is unequivocally later than **April 11, 1727**.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   Based on the dates, Albert Einstein died later than Isaac Newton.

**Final Answer: Yes**
