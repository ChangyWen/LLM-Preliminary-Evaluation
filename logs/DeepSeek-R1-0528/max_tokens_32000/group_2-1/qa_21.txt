*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Japan located east of China?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that China is a large country in East Asia. It's on the continent of Asia. Japan is an island nation in the Pacific Ocean.

Let me think about their geographical positions. China is mainly on the Asian mainland, and Japan is to the east of that mainland. For example, Tokyo, the capital of Japan, is east of Beijing, the capital of China.

I should consider the longitude. Beijing is around 116 degrees east longitude. Tokyo is around 139 degrees east longitude. Since higher longitude numbers are further east, Tokyo is east of Beijing.

But the question is about countries, not just capitals. So, I need to think about the relative positions of the countries as a whole.

China has a vast territory, including the eastern coast. Japan is situated in the Pacific Ocean, east of China's eastern coast.

Specifically, Japan is separated from China by the East China Sea. So, if you look at a map, China is to the west, and Japan is to the east.

For instance, Shanghai, a major city in eastern China, is at about 121 degrees east longitude. Fukuoka in Japan is at about 130 degrees east longitude, which is further east. Similarly, Okinawa in Japan is around 128 degrees east, still east of Shanghai.

Now, what about the westernmost point of Japan compared to the easternmost point of China? That might give a clearer picture.

The easternmost point of China is generally considered to be in Heilongjiang province, near the city of Fuyuan, which is around 135 degrees east longitude. But that's in the northeast, near Russia.

Japan extends from about 129 degrees east longitude in the west (like the island of Yonaguni) to about 146 degrees east in the east (like Minami Torishima).

Yonaguni, the westernmost inhabited island of Japan, is at approximately 123 degrees east longitude? Let me double-check.

Actually, Yonaguni is part of the Yaeyama Islands and is at about 122.9 degrees east longitude. I think I have it.

Standard coordinates: The westernmost point of Japan is Yonaguni Island, which is at approximately 122.93 degrees east longitude.

Now, the easternmost point of China: China's easternmost point is at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri rivers, near Fuyuan, Heilongjiang, which is around 135 degrees east longitude? No, that doesn't seem right because Japan is further east.

I think I'm confusing things. Let me think carefully.

China's easternmost point: Actually, the easternmost point is in the northeast, but due to the curvature, it might be different. But in terms of longitude, it should be higher.

Beijing is at 116E, Shanghai at 121E. The easternmost point of China is actually at the tip of the Liaodong Peninsula or something? No.

Upon second thought, China's easternmost longitude is around 135 degrees, but let's confirm.

I recall that the easternmost point of China is in Heilongjiang province, at the border with Russia, and it's at approximately 135 degrees 05 minutes east longitude. But that's in the far northeast.

Now, Japan's westernmost point is Yonaguni Island, which is at about 122 degrees 56 minutes east longitude, roughly 123E.

So, 123E for Japan's west vs. 135E for China's east? That would mean Japan's west is west of China's east, which can't be right because Japan is east of China.

I think I have a mistake here.

Longitude: East longitude increases as you go east.

China's easternmost point: Let's take a reliable source. I know that Shanghai is at 121E, but the easternmost point is further north.

Actually, the easternmost point of mainland China is at Fuyuan, Heilongjiang, which is at approximately 134.5 degrees east longitude. But Fuyuan is at about 134.7E.

But Japan's islands: The main islands are further south, but let's compare longitudes.

For example, the eastern coast of China, like Shanghai, is at 121E. The nearest part of Japan is the Ryukyu Islands, which include islands west of the main islands.

Yonaguni Island is the westernmost of Japan at about 122.93E. That is east of 121E, so it's east of Shanghai.

122.93E is greater than 121E, so yes, east.

Now, China's easternmost point: Fuyuan, Heilongjiang, is at about 134.67E. But that's way up north, and Japan is not directly east of that point; Japan is to the southeast.

For the purpose of this question, we need to see if any part of Japan is east of China, and vice versa, but generally, Japan is considered east of China.

Perhaps I should consider the centroid or the general position.

Since China has territories, but the main part is what matters.

Another thing: Taiwan. Taiwan is part of China, according to the One-China policy, but geographically, it's an island. Taiwan is at around 121E to 122E longitude.

Japan's Yonaguni is at 122.93E, which is slightly east of Taiwan's eastern coast? Taiwan's eastern coast is about 122E, so Yonaguni is a bit east.

But Japan as a whole is much further east.

For instance, Tokyo is at 139E, which is clearly east of any point in China.

China's easternmost point is about 135E, which is east of Tokyo? 135E vs 139E, 135 is west of 139, so Tokyo is east of China's easternmost point.

135E is less than 139E, so 135E is west of 139E. Therefore, points at 135E are west of points at 139E.

China's easternmost longitude is approximately 135E, and Japan's easternmost is about 146E, but even Japan's westernmost is about 123E.

Now, 123E compared to China: China has points as west as 73E in Xinjiang, but for east, the eastern coast is between 117E and 135E, roughly.

Specifically, the easternmost city or point.

I think I found the issue: China's easternmost point in terms of longitude is at the eastern tip of Heilongjiang, near the border with Russia, at about 135 degrees east. But this point is at a high latitude, around 48N.

Japan's main islands are further south, around 30N to 45N, and at longitudes from about 129E to 146E.

The westernmost point of Japan, Yonaguni, is at 24.46N, 122.93E.

Now, relative to China, let's take a point on the eastern coast, say, Shanghai at 31.2N, 121.5E.

Yonaguni at 24.46N, 122.93E is south-southeast of Shanghai, but longitude-wise, 122.93E vs 121.5E, so it is slightly east.

Similarly, the main islands of Japan, like Kyushu, start around 130E, which is further east.

Moreover, from any point on the eastern coast of China, Japan is to the east.

For example, from Shanghai (121.5E), Fukuoka in Japan is at 130.4E, which is east.

From Beijing (116.4E), Tokyo (139.7E) is far east.

Now, what about that northeastern point of China at 135E? That is close to Russia, and Japan's northern islands are to the east. For instance, Hokkaido is around 141E to 145E, which is east of 135E.

Therefore, in all cases, Japan is east of China.

But is there any part of China that is east of any part of Japan? For example, that point at 135E in Heilongjiang. Japan's westernmost is 123E, which is west of 135E. 123E is less than 135E, so 123E is west of 135E.

That means that the westernmost point of Japan (123E) is west of the easternmost point of China (135E). So, in terms of longitude, there are parts of China that are east of parts of Japan.

For example, Fuyuan, China at 135E is east of Yonaguni, Japan at 123E.

But geographically, since they are at different latitudes, we need to see the direction.

Fuyuan is at about 48.3N, 134.7E, and Yonaguni is at 24.4N, 122.9E. So, Yonaguni is south of Fuyuan, and also west because 122.9E < 134.7E.

Therefore, from Fuyuan, Yonaguni is to the southwest, not east.

But the question is "east of China," meaning relative to the country as a whole.

Typically, when we say one country is east of another, we mean that it is generally to the east, or that its territory lies east of the other country's territory.

In this case, most of Japan is east of most of China, but there is a small part of China that is east of a small part of Japan.

However, in common understanding, Japan is considered to be east of China.

Let me think about the Prime Meridian or standard references.

The International Date Line is another reference, but that might not help.

I can think about time zones. Both are in UTC+9 or similar, but China has a single time zone, UTC+8, while Japan is UTC+9, so Japan is one hour ahead, meaning it is further east.

That supports Japan being east of China.

Geographically, looking at a map, China is on the western side of the Pacific Rim, and Japan is an archipelago to the east.

The East China Sea is between them, with Japan on the eastern side.

Historically and culturally, Japan is often referred to as "east of China" or "the land of the rising sun" relative to China.

So, I think the answer should be yes.

But to be precise, let's confirm with a reliable source or logical reasoning.

I recall that the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands are claimed by both, but they are closer to Taiwan and are at around 123E to 124E, which is east of Taiwan (122E) but west of Japan's main islands.

But those islands are not part of mainland Japan; they are administered by Japan but disputed.

For the main territories, Japan is east.

Perhaps the question implies the core territories.

Another point: If we consider the center of each country.

The geographical center of China is approximately at 103E, 36N, in Gansu province.

The geographical center of Japan is around 138E, 36N, in Nagano prefecture.

So, 138E vs 103E, clearly Japan's center is east of China's center.

Similarly, for population centers, eastern China has high population, but Japan is still further east.

Therefore, I think it's safe to say that Japan is located east of China.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "show step-by-step reasoning," so I need to present that.

Also, for the final answer, just Yes or No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether Japan is located east of China. This requires comparing the geographical positions of the two countries, primarily focusing on longitude (east-west direction).

2. **Key Geographical Concepts**:
   - Longitude measures east-west position, with higher values indicating locations further east.
   - China is a large country on the Asian mainland, extending from approximately 73°E (western Xinjiang) to about 135°E (eastern Heilongjiang).
   - Japan is an island nation in the Pacific Ocean, consisting of several islands. Its territory extends from about 122.9°E (Yonaguni Island, the westernmost point) to about 146°E (Minami Torishima, the easternmost point).

3. **Compare Easternmost China vs. Westernmost Japan**:
   - China's easternmost point is near Fuyuan, Heilongjiang Province, at approximately 135°E longitude. This point is in the far northeast of China, near the Russian border.
   - Japan's westernmost point is Yonaguni Island (part of Okinawa Prefecture) at approximately 122.9°E longitude.
   - Comparison: 122.9°E (Japan's west) is less than 135°E (China's east), meaning Yonaguni Island is west of Fuyuan. However, this is a localized comparison and does not represent the general position of Japan relative to China as a whole. Yonaguni is also at a much lower latitude (about 24°N) than Fuyuan (about 48°N), so it is not directly east or west in a simple sense.

4. **Compare Core Regions for General Position**:
   - China's eastern coastline (e.g., Shanghai at 121.5°E) is a more representative reference for the country's eastern edge, as it faces the Pacific Ocean and is closer to Japan.
   - Japan's main islands (e.g., Kyushu, Honshu) begin around 129°E to 130°E and extend eastward.
   - For example:
     - Shanghai, China: ~121.5°E
     - Fukuoka, Japan (on Kyushu Island): ~130.4°E
     - Since 130.4°E > 121.5°E, Fukuoka is east of Shanghai.
   - Similarly, Beijing, China (~116.4°E) is west of Tokyo, Japan (~139.7°E), as 139.7°E > 116.4°E.

5. **Consider Centroid or Average Position**:
   - The geographical center of China is approximately 103°E, 36°N (near Lanzhou, Gansu Province).
   - The geographical center of Japan is approximately 138°E, 36°N (in Nagano Prefecture, Honshu Island).
   - Comparison: 138°E > 103°E, meaning Japan's center is significantly east of China's center.

6. **Time Zone Evidence**:
   - China uses a single time zone (UTC+8), while Japan uses UTC+9. The one-hour difference indicates that Japan is further east, as time zones generally advance with increasing longitude eastward.

7. **Geographical Context**:
   - Japan is separated from China by the East China Sea, with Japan lying entirely to the east of this sea and China to the west. This is consistent across maps and geographical references.
   - Historically and culturally, Japan is often described as "east of China" (e.g., from a Chinese perspective, Japan is where the sun rises).

8. **Addressing Edge Cases**:
   - While the easternmost point of China (135°E) is east of Japan's westernmost point (122.9°E), this is an exception due to China's northeast protrusion and does not change the overall orientation. The vast majority of Japan's territory (including all major islands) lies east of the vast majority of China's territory.
   - For instance, over 99% of Japan's population and land area is east of China's eastern coastline.

**Conclusion**: Based on longitude comparisons, geographical centers, time zones, and standard geographical knowledge, Japan is generally located east of China. The answer is Yes.

**Final Answer**: Yes
