*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the boiling point of water higher than the freezing point of water?" I need to answer with a step-by-step reasoning process and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, and the boiling point is 100 degrees Celsius. That's at standard atmospheric pressure, which is what we usually assume unless specified otherwise.

So, comparing 0°C and 100°C, 100 is greater than 0. Therefore, the boiling point is higher than the freezing point.

But let me make sure about the units. The question doesn't specify Celsius or Fahrenheit, but in science, we often use Celsius for such points. In Fahrenheit, freezing is 32°F and boiling is 212°F. 212 is also greater than 32, so it's the same relationship.

Similarly, in Kelvin, freezing is 273 K and boiling is 373 K. 373 > 273, so again, boiling point is higher.

So, no matter the scale, the boiling point is higher than the freezing point for water.

Now, for the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall the freezing point of water: 0°C (or 32°F, or 273 K).

2. Recall the boiling point of water: 100°C (or 212°F, or 373 K).

3. Compare the two values: 100 > 0, so boiling point is higher.

4. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The question is straightforward, so I don't think there's any trick here. Water freezes at a lower temperature and boils at a higher temperature, so by definition, the boiling point is higher.

Final answer: Yes.

The instruction says to show step-by-step reasoning and then the final answer. So I'll write that out.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the freezing point of water:** The freezing point of water is the temperature at which water turns into ice under standard atmospheric pressure. This is universally accepted as 0 degrees Celsius (°C).

2. **Identify the boiling point of water:** The boiling point of water is the temperature at which water turns into steam under standard atmospheric pressure. This is universally accepted as 100 degrees Celsius (°C).

3. **Compare the two points:**  
   - Freezing point: 0°C  
   - Boiling point: 100°C  
   Since 100 is greater than 0, the boiling point is higher than the freezing point.

4. **Consider other temperature scales for verification:**  
   - In Fahrenheit (°F): Freezing point is 32°F, boiling point is 212°F. 212 > 32, so boiling point is higher.  
   - In Kelvin (K): Freezing point is 273 K, boiling point is 373 K. 373 > 273, so boiling point is higher.  
   The relationship holds regardless of the temperature scale.

5. **Conclusion:** The boiling point of water is indeed higher than the freezing point of water.

### Final Answer:
Yes
