*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if the first moon landing happened after the first airplane flight. That means I should recall the dates for both events.

The first airplane flight: I think that was the Wright brothers. They flew their first successful powered aircraft on December 17, 1903.

The first moon landing: That was Apollo 11, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon on July 20, 1969.

Now, I need to compare these two dates to see if 1969 is after 1903.

1903 to 1969: That's a difference of 66 years. 1969 minus 1903 equals 66. So yes, 1969 is after 1903.

Since 1903 is earlier than 1969, the first moon landing did come after the first airplane flight.

I should make sure I have the facts right. Is there any dispute about these dates? I don't think so. The Wright brothers' first flight is well-documented as 1903, and Apollo 11 is 1969. No controversy there.

The question is straightforward: "Was the first moon landing after the first airplane flight?" Based on the dates, it should be yes.

Now, for the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the date of the first airplane flight: December 17, 1903, by the Wright brothers.

2. Identify the date of the first moon landing: July 20, 1969, by Apollo 11.

3. Compare the dates: 1969 is greater than 1903, meaning 1969 is after 1903.

4. Therefore, the first moon landing was after the first airplane flight.

Final answer: Yes.

The question says "Show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)." So I need to present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

1. **Identify the key events:**
   - The first airplane flight refers to the Wright brothers' successful powered flight. This occurred on **December 17, 1903**, in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, USA.
   - The first moon landing refers to the Apollo 11 mission, where humans first set foot on the moon. This occurred on **July 20, 1969**.

2. **Compare the dates:**
   - The year 1903 (first airplane flight) is earlier than the year 1969 (first moon landing).
   - Specifically, 1969 minus 1903 equals 66 years, confirming that 1969 is after 1903.

3. **Conclusion based on the comparison:**
   - Since 1969 is later than 1903, the first moon landing occurred after the first airplane flight.

**Final Answer: Yes**
