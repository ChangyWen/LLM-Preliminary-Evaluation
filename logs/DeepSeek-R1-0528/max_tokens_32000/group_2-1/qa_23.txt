*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the pH of lemon juice lower than that of water?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. It ranges from 0 to 14, with lower numbers being more acidic, higher numbers more basic, and 7 being neutral.

Water is neutral, so its pH is 7. That's standard for pure water at room temperature.

Lemon juice is acidic because it contains citric acid. I've heard that lemon juice has a low pH, meaning it's acidic.

I should recall the typical pH values. For lemon juice, I think it's around 2 to 3. Let me confirm that. Yes, lemon juice is highly acidic, with a pH usually between 2 and 3.

Water, specifically pure water, has a pH of 7.

Since 2 or 3 is less than 7, that means lemon juice has a lower pH than water.

Lower pH means more acidic. So, yes, lemon juice is more acidic than water, hence its pH is lower.

To be thorough, let's think about the definition. pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration: pH = -log[H⁺]. A lower pH means a higher concentration of H⁺ ions.

Lemon juice has a high concentration of H⁺ ions because of the citric acid, which dissociates to release H⁺. Water has a very low concentration of H⁺ ions, only from the autoionization, which is 10⁻⁷ M, giving pH=7.

So, clearly, [H⁺] in lemon juice is higher than in water, so pH is lower.

I think I'm confident with this.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

So, I'll outline the steps:

Step 1: Recall that pH measures acidity, with lower pH indicating higher acidity.

Step 2: Water is neutral with pH = 7.

Step 3: Lemon juice is acidic due to citric acid, with a typical pH between 2 and 3.

Step 4: Since 2-3 is less than 7, lemon juice has a lower pH than water.

Therefore, the answer is Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Understand pH**: pH is a scale used to measure the acidity or basicity of a solution. It ranges from 0 to 14, with lower values indicating higher acidity, higher values indicating higher basicity, and a pH of 7 being neutral.

2. **pH of Water**: Pure water (at 25°C) is neutral and has a pH of 7. This is because water dissociates slightly into H⁺ and OH⁻ ions, resulting in equal concentrations and a neutral pH.

3. **pH of Lemon Juice**: Lemon juice is acidic because it contains citric acid and other organic acids. These acids release hydrogen ions (H⁺) when dissolved in water, increasing the H⁺ concentration. The typical pH range for lemon juice is between 2.0 and 3.0, depending on factors like ripeness and dilution.

4. **Comparison**:  
   - Water pH = 7 (neutral).  
   - Lemon juice pH ≈ 2.0–3.0 (acidic).  
   Since the pH of lemon juice (e.g., 2.5) is numerically lower than the pH of water (7), lemon juice is more acidic and thus has a lower pH.

5. **Scientific Confirmation**: This is consistent with the definition of pH (pH = -log[H⁺]). Lemon juice has a higher concentration of H⁺ ions than water, leading to a lower pH value.

### Final Answer:
Yes
