First, the question is: "Is the speed of light faster than the speed of sound?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the speed of light and the speed of sound are both physical constants, but they are very different. Light is an electromagnetic wave, and sound is a mechanical wave that requires a medium to travel through.

The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. That's about 3.00 × 10^8 m/s. I should use this value since it's the fastest light can travel.

The speed of sound depends on the medium it's traveling through. For example, in air at room temperature (around 20°C), the speed of sound is about 343 meters per second. That's 3.43 × 10^2 m/s.

Now, comparing these two: 3.00 × 10^8 m/s for light and 3.43 × 10^2 m/s for sound. That means light is much faster. To be precise, let's divide the speed of light by the speed of sound:

Speed of light / Speed of sound = (3.00 × 10^8) / (3.43 × 10^2) = (3.00 / 3.43) × 10^(8-2) = approximately 0.875 × 10^6 = 8.75 × 10^5.

So, light is about 875,000 times faster than sound in air.

But the question doesn't specify the medium for sound. However, in common contexts, when people compare light and sound, they often refer to light in vacuum or air and sound in air. Light travels slower in other media, like water or glass, but in vacuum, it's at its fastest. Sound in air is a standard reference.

For instance, during a thunderstorm, you see lightning before you hear thunder because light travels much faster than sound.

So, universally, the speed of light is greater than the speed of sound in any medium. Let me confirm that.

In water, the speed of sound is about 1,480 m/s, which is faster than in air but still much slower than light. Light in water is slower than in vacuum, about 2.25 × 10^8 m/s, which is still way faster than 1,480 m/s.

Similarly, in solids, sound can be faster; for example, in steel, sound travels at about 5,960 m/s. But light, even in dense media, is around 2 × 10^8 m/s, which is still orders of magnitude faster.

Light speed in glass is about 2 × 10^8 m/s, and sound in glass might be higher, but let's say 5,000 m/s or so. 2e8 vs 5e3 is still 40,000 times faster.

So, in all practical cases, light is faster than sound.

The speed of light is a fundamental constant, and nothing travels faster than light in vacuum. Sound is always slower.

Therefore, the answer should be yes.

Final answer: Yes.

The question says "show step-by-step reasoning," so I need to outline it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the question**: The question asks whether the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound. This requires comparing two physical phenomena: light (an electromagnetic wave) and sound (a mechanical wave).

2. **Define the speed of light**:  
   - The speed of light in a vacuum is a fundamental constant of nature.  
   - Its value is approximately **299,792,458 meters per second (m/s)**, which is often rounded to **3.00 × 10^8 m/s** for simplicity.  
   - Light can travel through a vacuum and other media, but its speed is highest in a vacuum. In other media (like air, water, or glass), it slows down but remains extremely fast.

3. **Define the speed of sound**:  
   - Sound is a mechanical wave that requires a medium (such as air, water, or solids) to propagate.  
   - Its speed depends on the medium and conditions (e.g., temperature, density). For example:  
     - In dry air at 20°C (room temperature), sound travels at about **343 m/s** (or **3.43 × 10^2 m/s**).  
     - In water, sound is faster (around 1,480 m/s), and in solids like steel, it can be much faster (up to about 5,960 m/s).  
   - However, in everyday contexts, the comparison is often made with sound in air, as it is the most common reference point.

4. **Compare the speeds**:  
   - Use the standard values for a clear comparison:  
     - Speed of light in vacuum: **3.00 × 10^8 m/s**  
     - Speed of sound in air (20°C): **3.43 × 10^2 m/s**  
   - Calculate the ratio:  
     - Speed of light / Speed of sound = (3.00 × 10^8) / (3.43 × 10^2) ≈ 8.75 × 10^5  
     - This means light is approximately **875,000 times faster** than sound in air.  
   - Even in other media:  
     - In water, light slows to about 2.25 × 10^8 m/s, while sound is about 1,480 m/s. Light is still about 152,000 times faster.  
     - In steel, light slows to roughly 2.00 × 10^8 m/s (in glass-like media), while sound is about 5,960 m/s. Light is still about 33,500 times faster.  
   - In all cases, the speed of light is vastly greater than the speed of sound.

5. **Consider real-world observations**:  
   - Common experiences, like seeing lightning before hearing thunder during a storm, demonstrate that light travels much faster than sound. The delay occurs because light reaches us almost instantly, while sound takes much longer.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   - The speed of light is always greater than the speed of sound in any medium, based on the fundamental properties of electromagnetic waves vs. mechanical waves.  
   - Therefore, the answer is **Yes**.

**Final Answer: Yes**
