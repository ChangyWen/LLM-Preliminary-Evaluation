*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the melting point of ice lower than the boiling point of water?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the melting point of ice is the temperature at which ice turns into water. For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, that's 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

The boiling point of water is the temperature at which water turns into steam. At standard atmospheric pressure, that's 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

Now, comparing 0 degrees Celsius to 100 degrees Celsius, 0 is less than 100. So, the melting point is lower than the boiling point.

I should confirm the units. The question doesn't specify units, but in science, we usually use Celsius for such comparisons. Also, in Kelvin, melting point is 273 K and boiling point is 373 K, and 273 is less than 373, so same result.

Is there any condition where this might not be true? For example, under different pressures. But the question doesn't mention any specific conditions, so I think we assume standard atmospheric pressure.

The question says "ice" and "water," which implies pure water under normal conditions. So, no tricks here.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The melting point of ice is 0°C at standard pressure.

2. The boiling point of water is 100°C at standard pressure.

3. 0°C is less than 100°C.

4. Therefore, the melting point of ice is lower than the boiling point of water.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question asks to show step-by-step reasoning and then the final answer. I think I've got that.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the key terms**:
   - The **melting point** of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from a solid to a liquid. For ice (solid water), this occurs at 0°C (32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm).
   - The **boiling point** of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a gas. For water, this occurs at 100°C (212°F) under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm).

2. **Compare the values numerically**:
   - Melting point of ice: 0°C
   - Boiling point of water: 100°C
   - Since 0 is less than 100, the melting point (0°C) is lower than the boiling point (100°C).

3. **Consider units and conditions**:
   - The comparison is typically done in Celsius (°C) for simplicity, as it is the standard unit for such measurements in science.
   - In Fahrenheit (°F), the melting point is 32°F and the boiling point is 212°F. 32 is less than 212, confirming the same relationship.
   - In Kelvin (K), the melting point is 273 K and the boiling point is 373 K. 273 is less than 373, again supporting the conclusion.
   - The question does not specify any non-standard conditions (e.g., pressure changes), so we assume standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), where these values are well-established.

4. **Address any potential exceptions**:
   - Under non-standard pressures, these points can shift (e.g., lower pressure lowers the boiling point, but the melting point is less affected). However, since the question does not mention any specific conditions, we use the standard values.
   - For pure water, the relationship holds. Impurities could alter the melting or boiling points, but the question refers to "ice" and "water," implying pure substances under normal conditions.

**Final Answer: Yes**
