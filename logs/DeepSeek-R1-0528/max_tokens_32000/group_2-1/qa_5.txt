*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Russia larger in area than Australia?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Russia is the largest country in the world by land area, and Australia is also a very large country, but I'm not sure if it's bigger than Russia. I should recall the approximate areas of both.

Let me start with Russia. I think Russia has an area of about 17 million square kilometers. I remember that Russia spans across Europe and Asia, and it's huge. Specifically, I think it's around 17,098,242 square kilometers. But for comparison, I don't need the exact number; an approximation is fine.

Now, for Australia, I think it's about 7.7 million square kilometers. Australia is a continent and a country, so its land area includes the mainland and some islands. I believe it's approximately 7,692,024 square kilometers. Again, I can use rounded figures.

So, comparing 17 million vs. 7.7 million, 17 million is larger than 7.7 million. That seems straightforward.

But let me double-check to be sure. I should confirm these numbers.

I recall that the total land area of Earth is about 148.9 million square kilometers, and Russia makes up roughly 11% of that, which would be about 16.4 million if I calculate 11% of 148.9. But I think 17 million is the standard figure.

For Australia, I think it's the sixth-largest country by area. The order is: Russia, Canada, China, USA, Brazil, and then Australia. Is that right?

Let me list the top countries by area:

1. Russia: ~17.1 million km²

2. Canada: ~9.98 million km²

3. China: ~9.6 million km²? I think China is about 9.7 million, but including all territories.

Actually, I should look for reliable figures in my mind.

I remember that Russia is about 17,125,200 square kilometers or something close. And Australia is about 7,688,000 square kilometers. So clearly, 17 million is more than 7 million.

But let me make sure about Australia. Australia includes Tasmania and other islands, but the main area is around 7.7 million.

Another way: Russia is larger than Pluto's surface area or something, but that might not help. No, stick to Earth facts.

I can think about the continents. Australia is the smallest continent, with an area of about 7.7 million km², while Asia, where Russia is partly located, is about 44 million km², but Russia is only a part of it.

Specifically, Russia covers a significant portion of Asia and Eastern Europe.

But I think I'm overcomplicating. The simple fact is that Russia is the largest country, and Australia is much smaller.

But just to be thorough, let's recall some numbers.

Upon second thought, I think Russia's area is 17,098,242 km², and Australia's area is 7,692,024 km². So, 17 million vs. 7.7 million, difference is huge.

Therefore, Russia is larger than Australia.

The question is: "Is Russia larger in area than Australia?" Based on this, yes.

But is there any trick? Like, does Australia include external territories that make it larger? I don't think so. The standard land area for Australia is about 7.7 million, including all its territories.

Similarly, Russia includes all its territory.

Sometimes people might think of only the mainland, but no, the area includes all land under a country's control.

Another thing: Russia has more land area because it spans two continents, but Australia is a whole continent itself, but it's smaller.

Yes, continents have different sizes; Australia is the smallest continent.

For comparison:

- Asia: ~44.6 million km²

- Africa: ~30.4 million

- North America: ~24.7 million

- South America: ~17.8 million

- Antarctica: ~14.0 million

- Europe: ~10.2 million

- Australia: ~7.7 million

Australia as a continent is about 7.7 million, and that's the country as well, since it's the only country on the continent.

Russia is part of both Europe and Asia, with a total area larger than any single continent except Asia and maybe others, but no, South America is about 17.8, Russia is 17.1, so Russia is smaller than South America? No.

South America is about 17.84 million km², and Russia is 17.10 million, so South America is slightly larger than Russia? Is that right?

I think I have a confusion.

Standard figures:

- Russia: 17,098,242 km² (source: various, like CIA World Factbook)

- South America: approximately 17,840,000 km²

But Russia is a country, South America is a continent.

For country comparison:

- Russia: 17.1 million km²

- Canada: 9.98 million

- United States: 9.83 million (including Alaska and Hawaii)

- China: 9.60 million (including disputed areas)

- Brazil: 8.51 million

- Australia: 7.69 million

Yes, so Russia is larger than all of them.

Specifically, Australia is 7.69 million, Russia is 17.10 million, so Russia is more than twice as large as Australia.

Therefore, yes, Russia is larger in area than Australia.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "show step-by-step reasoning" and then "final answer (Yes or No)."

So, in reasoning, I can state the areas roughly.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. I recall that the land area of Russia is approximately 17.1 million square kilometers.

2. The land area of Australia is approximately 7.7 million square kilometers.

3. Comparing these two figures: 17.1 million > 7.7 million.

4. Therefore, Russia has a larger area than Australia.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Identify the land areas of both countries**:  
   - Russia is the largest country in the world by land area. According to reliable sources like the CIA World Factbook and the United Nations, Russia's total land area is approximately **17.1 million square kilometers** (specifically, 17,098,242 km²).  
   - Australia is the sixth-largest country in the world by land area. Its total land area, including the mainland and all external territories (such as Tasmania), is approximately **7.7 million square kilometers** (specifically, 7,692,024 km²).  

2. **Compare the areas**:  
   - Convert the areas to the same unit for easy comparison (both are in million square kilometers):  
     - Russia: 17.1 million km²  
     - Australia: 7.7 million km²  
   - Since 17.1 million is greater than 7.7 million, Russia is larger.  

3. **Consider any potential discrepancies**:  
   - Both figures include all sovereign territory (e.g., for Russia, this spans Europe and Asia; for Australia, it includes islands like Tasmania).  
   - Russia's area is more than double that of Australia (17.1 ÷ 7.7 ≈ 2.22), so the difference is significant and not subject to minor variations in measurement.  

4. **Conclusion based on the comparison**:  
   - The numerical comparison confirms that Russia's land area is larger than Australia's.  

**Final Answer**: Yes
