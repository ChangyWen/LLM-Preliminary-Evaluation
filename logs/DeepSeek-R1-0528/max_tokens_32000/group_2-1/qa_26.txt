First, I need to recall the timeline of the discovery of penicillin and the discovery of the DNA structure.

Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum killed bacteria in a petri dish. That's a key point.

Now, the DNA structure was discovered later. I think it was James Watson and Francis Crick who described the double helix structure of DNA. That happened in 1953. I remember that because it's a famous moment in science history.

So, let's list the years:

- Penicillin discovery: 1928

- DNA structure discovery: 1953

1928 is before 1953, right? Yes, definitely.

But I should double-check to make sure I have the dates correct.

For penicillin: Alexander Fleming discovered it in 1928, but it wasn't widely used until later when Howard Florey and Ernst Chain developed it into a medicine during World War II. But the discovery itself is attributed to Fleming in 1928.

For DNA: The structure was indeed figured out by Watson, Crick, and Rosalind Franklin in 1953. Franklin's X-ray diffraction images were crucial, and Watson and Crick built the model.

So, comparing 1928 to 1953, 1928 is earlier.

Therefore, penicillin was discovered before the DNA structure.

The question is: "Was the discovery of penicillin before the discovery of DNA structure?" And I need to say Yes or No.

Based on this, it should be Yes.

But let me make sure there's no trick here. Is there any earlier discovery related to DNA that might be considered? For example, DNA itself was discovered in 1869 by Friedrich Miescher, but that's the molecule, not the structure. The structure is specifically the double helix, which is 1953.

The question says "discovery of DNA structure," so it's clear it means the double helix model.

Similarly, penicillin discovery is Fleming's observation in 1928.

So, no issues.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the key events: Discovery of penicillin and discovery of DNA structure.

2. Recall the year for penicillin discovery: 1928 by Alexander Fleming.

3. Recall the year for DNA structure discovery: 1953 by Watson, Crick, and Franklin.

4. Compare the years: 1928 is before 1953.

5. Therefore, the discovery of penicillin was before the discovery of DNA structure.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the discovery of penicillin:**
   - Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928. He observed that the mold *Penicillium notatum* inhibited bacterial growth in a petri dish, marking the initial discovery of the antibiotic properties.
   - This is a well-established historical fact, documented in scientific literature and history of medicine sources.

2. **Identify the discovery of the DNA structure:**
   - The structure of DNA, specifically the double helix, was discovered by James Watson, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin (with Franklin's critical X-ray diffraction data) in 1953. Watson and Crick published their model in the journal *Nature* that year, which is widely recognized as the breakthrough in understanding DNA's molecular structure.
   - Note that DNA as a molecule was first isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869, but the question specifically refers to the "structure" (i.e., the double helix), not the initial identification of the molecule.

3. **Compare the dates:**
   - Penicillin discovery: 1928.
   - DNA structure discovery: 1953.
   - Since 1928 is earlier than 1953, the discovery of penicillin occurred before the discovery of the DNA structure.

4. **Confirm historical context:**
   - Penicillin's discovery in 1928 predates major developments in molecular biology, such as the work on DNA in the early 1950s. The 1953 DNA structure discovery built on earlier research (e.g., by Oswald Avery in 1944, who showed DNA carries genetic information), but the structural elucidation itself is firmly dated to 1953.
   - There is no ambiguity in the timelines; both events are well-documented milestones in science history.

**Final Answer: Yes**
