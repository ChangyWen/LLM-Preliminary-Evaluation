First, the question is: "Is the atomic number of oxygen higher than that of carbon?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a final answer of Yes or No.

The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It defines the element. So, for carbon, what is its atomic number? I think it's 6. Carbon has 6 protons, so atomic number 6.

For oxygen, it should be 8. Oxygen has 8 protons, so atomic number 8.

Now, comparing the two: 8 vs. 6. Is 8 higher than 6? Yes, 8 is greater than 6.

I should confirm the atomic numbers to be sure. I know the periodic table: hydrogen is 1, helium is 2, lithium is 3, beryllium is 4, boron is 5, carbon is 6, nitrogen is 7, oxygen is 8. Yes, that's standard.

So, oxygen has a higher atomic number than carbon.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process," so I need to outline that clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand atomic number**: The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of its atom. It uniquely identifies the element and determines its position in the periodic table.

2. **Recall the atomic number of carbon**: Carbon (symbol C) is the element with 6 protons. Therefore, its atomic number is 6.

3. **Recall the atomic number of oxygen**: Oxygen (symbol O) is the element with 8 protons. Therefore, its atomic number is 8.

4. **Compare the atomic numbers**: Compare the atomic number of oxygen (8) with that of carbon (6). Since 8 is greater than 6, oxygen has a higher atomic number than carbon.

**Final Answer: Yes**
