*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Mount Everest taller than K2?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Mount Everest and K2 are both mountains, and they are among the highest in the world. Mount Everest is often cited as the tallest, but I should confirm the actual heights.

Let me recall the heights:

- Mount Everest is located in the Himalayas, on the border between Nepal and China. Its height is approximately 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. This is the widely accepted figure, but I think it was updated recently. I should use the most current data.

I remember that in 2020, Nepal and China jointly announced a new height for Everest as 8,848.86 meters. But for general purposes, 8,848 meters is fine.

Now, K2 is the second-highest mountain in the world. It's part of the Karakoram range, on the border between Pakistan and China. Its height is about 8,611 meters (28,251 feet).

I should double-check these numbers to be accurate.

Let me think about reliable sources. I can recall from geography that Everest is taller than K2. K2 is often called the "Savage Mountain" because it's more difficult to climb, but it's not taller.

Heights:

- Mount Everest: 8,848 meters

- K2: 8,611 meters

So, 8,848 > 8,611, which means Everest is taller.

But to be thorough, let's confirm the exact figures.

I know that there might be variations due to different measurements, but the standard heights are well-established.

For example:

- Everest: 8,848 m (29,029 ft)

- K2: 8,611 m (28,251 ft)

Yes, that's consistent.

Sometimes people mention that Mauna Kea in Hawaii is taller from base to summit, but that's not relevant here because we're comparing peak heights above sea level.

The question is specifically about height above sea level, I assume, as that's the standard for such comparisons.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the heights of both mountains.

2. Compare the numerical values.

3. Conclude based on which is larger.

Sources: I should cite where I get the information, but since this is common knowledge, I can state it.

To be precise:

- According to various sources like the National Geographic, Encyclopedia Britannica, and official surveys, Mount Everest is 8,848 meters high.

- K2 is 8,611 meters high.

Therefore, since 8,848 > 8,611, Mount Everest is taller.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "taller than K2", so if Everest is taller, the answer is Yes.

Now, for the reasoning:

Step 1: Recall the height of Mount Everest. It is 8,848 meters above sea level, as per the latest surveys.

Step 2: Recall the height of K2. It is 8,611 meters above sea level.

Step 3: Compare the two heights: 8,848 meters vs. 8,611 meters.

Step 4: Since 8,848 is greater than 8,611, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

Step 5: Therefore, the answer is Yes.

I think that's solid.

But just to be extra sure, is there any chance that K2 is taller? No, all records show Everest as the tallest.

Also, in some contexts, people might confuse with other peaks, but K2 is consistently the second highest.

For example, Kangchenjunga is third at 8,586 meters, which is less than K2.

So, no issue.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the heights of both mountains:**
   - Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world. According to the most recent and authoritative surveys (jointly conducted by Nepal and China in 2020), its height is **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)** above sea level. For simplicity, this is often rounded to 8,849 meters or 29,032 feet, but the precise figure is 8,848.86 m.
   - K2 is the second-highest mountain in the world. According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department and other reliable sources (like the Survey of Pakistan), its height is **8,611 meters (28,251 feet)** above sea level. This measurement is well-established and consistent across sources.

2. **Compare the numerical heights:**
   - Mount Everest: 8,848.86 meters
   - K2: 8,611 meters
   - Subtract K2's height from Mount Everest's height to confirm the difference:  
     8,848.86 m - 8,611 m = 237.86 meters
   - This means Mount Everest is taller by approximately 238 meters (or about 781 feet).

3. **Consider any potential discrepancies:**
   - Heights of mountains can sometimes vary slightly due to new measurements, geological activity, or different methodologies (e.g., snow cap vs. rock height). However:
     - Mount Everest's height was reaffirmed in 2020 with modern GPS and satellite technology, making it highly accurate.
     - K2's height has remained consistent at 8,611 meters in all major surveys, with no significant revisions.
   - Even if we use rounded figures (e.g., 8,849 m for Everest vs. 8,611 m for K2), the comparison is clear: 8,849 > 8,611.

4. **Conclusion based on the comparison:**
   - Since 8,848.86 meters (Everest) is greater than 8,611 meters (K2), Mount Everest is taller than K2.

**Final Answer: Yes**
