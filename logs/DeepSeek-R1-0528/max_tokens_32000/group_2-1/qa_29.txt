*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the wavelength of red light longer than that of blue light?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I recall that light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. Visible light ranges from about 380 nanometers (nm) to 750 nm.

Red light is on the longer wavelength end of the visible spectrum, and blue light is on the shorter wavelength end. Let me confirm that.

From what I remember:

- Violet light has the shortest wavelength, around 380-450 nm.

- Blue light is around 450-495 nm.

- Green is around 495-570 nm.

- Yellow is around 570-590 nm.

- Orange is around 590-620 nm.

- Red light has the longest wavelength, around 620-750 nm.

So, comparing red and blue: red light wavelengths are longer than blue light wavelengths. For example, a typical red wavelength might be 700 nm, and a typical blue might be 475 nm. Clearly, 700 nm is greater than 475 nm, so red has a longer wavelength.

I should think about the electromagnetic spectrum. The visible spectrum is a small part, and within it, frequency and wavelength are related by the speed of light: c = λν, where c is speed of light, λ is wavelength, ν is frequency.

Since c is constant, wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional. So, longer wavelength means lower frequency.

Red light has a lower frequency than blue light. That makes sense because red light is less energetic than blue light; blue light has higher energy per photon since E = hν, and ν is higher for blue.

But the question is specifically about wavelength, not frequency.

So, to answer directly: yes, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

Let me make sure there are no tricks here. Is this always true? In the visible spectrum, yes. The order is consistent: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, with red having the longest wavelength and violet the shortest.

Sometimes people say "blue" might be confused with indigo or something, but generally, blue is shorter than red.

In terms of the rainbow: ROYGBIV – red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Red is first, so longest wavelength; violet last, shortest.

Therefore, red > blue in wavelength.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Visible light wavelengths range from approximately 380 nm (violet) to 750 nm (red).

2. Blue light has wavelengths typically between 450 nm and 495 nm.

3. Red light has wavelengths typically between 620 nm and 750 nm.

4. Therefore, the shortest red light (620 nm) is still longer than the longest blue light (495 nm).

5. So, all red light has longer wavelengths than all blue light.

6. Hence, the wavelength of red light is longer than that of blue light.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

So, I need to box the final answer as well.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the electromagnetic spectrum**: Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum and consists of different colors, each corresponding to a specific range of wavelengths. The wavelength of light determines its color, with longer wavelengths appearing red and shorter wavelengths appearing blue or violet.

2. **Typical wavelength ranges**:
   - Red light: Approximately 620–750 nanometers (nm).
   - Blue light: Approximately 450–495 nm.

3. **Comparison of wavelengths**:
   - The minimum wavelength for red light (around 620 nm) is greater than the maximum wavelength for blue light (around 495 nm).
   - For example:
     - A common wavelength for red light is 700 nm.
     - A common wavelength for blue light is 475 nm.
     - Since 700 nm > 475 nm, red light has a longer wavelength.

4. **Relationship with frequency (for completeness)**:
   - Wavelength (λ) and frequency (ν) are inversely related by the speed of light (c ≈ 3 × 10^8 m/s), given by c = λν.
   - Red light has a lower frequency than blue light because it has a longer wavelength. This confirms that red light is less energetic (since photon energy E = hν, where h is Planck's constant).

5. **Conclusion based on the visible spectrum order**:
   - In the visible spectrum, colors are ordered from longest to shortest wavelength as: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet (ROYGBIV).
   - Red light consistently has the longest wavelengths in the visible range, while blue light has shorter wavelengths.

Therefore, the wavelength of red light is longer than that of blue light.

**Final Answer: Yes**
