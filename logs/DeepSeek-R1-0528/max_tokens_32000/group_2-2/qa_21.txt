*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is China located east of Japan?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I should recall the geographical locations of China and Japan. Both are countries in Asia. Japan is an island nation, and China is a large continental country.

Let me think about their relative positions. Japan is situated to the east of the Asian continent. Specifically, Japan is east of China. For example, Tokyo, the capital of Japan, is at approximately 139°E longitude, while Beijing, the capital of China, is at about 116°E longitude. Longitude measures how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian.

The Prime Meridian is at 0° longitude. As you go east, longitude increases up to 180°E, and west up to 180°W. But for this, we can think in terms of east longitude.

Beijing, China: around 116°E  
Tokyo, Japan: around 139°E

Since 139°E is greater than 116°E, that means Tokyo is east of Beijing. Therefore, Japan is east of China.

The question is asking if China is east of Japan. So, if Japan is east of China, then China must be west of Japan, not east.

Let me confirm the longitudes:

- Beijing, China: approximately 116.4°E

- Tokyo, Japan: approximately 139.7°E

Yes, 139.7°E is east of 116.4°E. So, Japan is east of China.

Therefore, China is west of Japan.

But let's think about the entire countries. China is a large country, so parts of it might be east or west, but generally, we consider the relative position based on central points or the bulk of the land.

For instance, eastern China is closer to Japan, but still, the core of China is west of Japan.

Japan is to the east of China, so China is to the west of Japan.

The question is specifically: "Is China located east of Japan?"

Since Japan is east of China, China cannot be east of Japan; it must be west.

I should consider the map. Looking at a mental map, China is on the mainland of Asia, and Japan is an archipelago to the east of China, separated by the East China Sea.

So, from Japan, China is to the west.

If I stand in Japan, looking west, I see China. If I stand in China, looking east, I see Japan.

Therefore, China is west of Japan, not east.

So, the answer should be No.

But let me double-check with another point. What about Shanghai? Shanghai is in eastern China, at about 121°E. Tokyo is at 139°E. 121°E vs. 139°E, still 121 is less than 139, so Shanghai is west of Tokyo.

Even the easternmost point of China. What is the easternmost point? I think it's somewhere near Shanghai or the coast, but still around 123°E or so. For example, the eastern tip of China is at about 122-123°E.

Japan's westernmost point is the island of Yonaguni, which is around 123°E, but most of Japan is further east. Tokyo is 139°E, and even the main islands are from about 129°E to 145°E or so.

Yonaguni is part of Okinawa Prefecture and is at approximately 123°E, which is very close to eastern China's longitude. For instance, Shanghai is 121°E, so Yonaguni at 123°E is slightly east of Shanghai.

But Yonaguni is a small island; the main part of Japan, like Honshu, where Tokyo is, is much further east.

For the purpose of this question, we should consider the primary landmasses or the capitals for simplicity.

Even if we take the closest points, eastern China at 122°E and western Japan at 123°E, that would mean China is slightly west, but at some points, they might be at similar longitudes, but generally, Japan is considered east of China.

Specifically, to say China is east of Japan would be incorrect.

Let's think about the direction: East of Japan would be the Pacific Ocean, beyond Japan. For example, from Japan, east is towards the Americas, not back towards Asia.

So, China is not east of Japan; it's west.

Another way: time zones. Japan is in the Japan Standard Time (JST), UTC+9, while China is in China Standard Time (CST), also UTC+8.5 or something? No, China uses a single time zone, UTC+8, for the whole country, even though it spans multiple time zones geographically. But Beijing is UTC+8, and Tokyo is UTC+9.

Since Tokyo is UTC+9 and Beijing is UTC+8, that means Tokyo is one hour ahead, so it's further east. Time zones increase as you go east.

So, Japan being UTC+9 and China UTC+8 confirms that Japan is east of China.

Therefore, China cannot be east of Japan.

So, the answer is No.

Final answer should be No.

The question says "Show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

So, I've reasoned step by step:

1. Recalled that Japan is an island nation east of the Asian mainland.

2. Compared longitudes: Beijing ~116°E, Tokyo ~139°E, so Tokyo is east of Beijing.

3. Concluded that since Japan is east of China, China is west of Japan.

4. Considered that even eastern China (e.g., Shanghai ~121°E) is west of most of Japan.

5. Time zone difference: Japan UTC+9, China UTC+8, confirming Japan is east.

Therefore, China is not located east of Japan.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether China is located east of Japan. This requires comparing the geographical positions of both countries, primarily using longitude as a key indicator since east-west positioning is determined by longitude.

2. **Recall Basic Geography**: 
   - China is a large country located on the eastern part of the Asian continent.
   - Japan is an island nation situated to the east of the Asian mainland, separated from China by the East China Sea and other bodies of water.

3. **Compare Longitudes**:
   - Longitude measures how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian (0° longitude). Higher longitude values (up to 180°E) indicate positions further east.
   - **China's approximate longitude**: The capital, Beijing, is at about 116°E. Even eastern parts of China, such as Shanghai, are around 121°E to 123°E.
   - **Japan's approximate longitude**: The capital, Tokyo, is at about 139°E. Western parts of Japan, such as Yonaguni Island, are around 123°E, but most of Japan (including the main islands like Honshu and Hokkaido) ranges from about 129°E to 145°E.
   - **Comparison**: Beijing (116°E) is west of Tokyo (139°E). Similarly, Shanghai (121°E) is west of Tokyo and even west of Japan's westernmost point (Yonaguni at 123°E). Therefore, the bulk of China lies west of Japan.

4. **Consider Time Zones**:
   - Time zones reflect longitudinal positioning, with later time zones indicating further east.
   - China uses a single time zone (UTC+8) nationwide, while Japan uses UTC+9.
   - Since Japan is one hour ahead of China, it confirms that Japan is further east.

5. **Visualize Relative Positions**:
   - From Japan, looking east leads to the Pacific Ocean (e.g., toward Hawaii or the Americas).
   - From Japan, looking west leads to the Asian continent, including China. Therefore, China is west of Japan.

6. **Address Potential Edge Cases**:
   - While a tiny part of western Japan (e.g., Yonaguni at 123°E) is very close to eastern China (e.g., near Shanghai at 121°E), this does not change the overall relationship. Even at the closest points, China is generally west of Japan, and no part of China is significantly east of any part of Japan.
   - China as a whole is not east of Japan; it is predominantly to the west.

**Final Answer**: No
