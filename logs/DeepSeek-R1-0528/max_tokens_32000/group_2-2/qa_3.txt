*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine the years when Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein died. Then, I can compare their death years to see who died later.

Isaac Newton: I know he was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution. He was born in 1643 and died in 1727. Let me confirm that. Yes, Newton was born on January 4, 1643, and died on March 31, 1727.

Albert Einstein: He was a physicist famous for the theory of relativity. He was born in 1879 and died in 1955. Specifically, born on March 14, 1879, and died on April 18, 1955.

Now, I need to compare their death years: Newton died in 1727, and Einstein died in 1955.

Clearly, 1955 is later than 1727. That means Einstein died after Newton.

The question is: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?" If I say "yes," that would mean Newton died after Einstein, but according to the years, Newton died before Einstein.

Let me parse the question carefully.

"Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?"

- "Die later than" means did Newton die after Einstein in time.

- Newton died in 1727.

- Einstein died in 1955.

- 1727 is before 1955, so Newton died earlier than Einstein.

Therefore, Newton did not die later than Einstein; in fact, he died earlier.

So, the answer should be no.

But let me make sure about the years to avoid any mistakes.

Newton: Died 1727.

Einstein: Died 1955.

Difference: 1955 - 1727 = 228 years. So Einstein died 228 years after Newton.

Hence, Newton died earlier.

The question is specifically: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?" So, is it true that Newton died later than Einstein? No, it's false.

Therefore, the answer is no.

Now, for the reasoning:

Step 1: Identify Isaac Newton's death year. He died in 1727.

Step 2: Identify Albert Einstein's death year. He died in 1955.

Step 3: Compare the years: 1727 vs. 1955. Since 1727 is less than 1955, Newton died before Einstein.

Step 4: Therefore, Newton did not die later than Einstein.

Final answer: No.

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

So, I should present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Isaac Newton's death year:**
   - Isaac Newton was a renowned physicist and mathematician.
   - He died on **March 31, 1727**.

2. **Identify Albert Einstein's death year:**
   - Albert Einstein was a famous physicist known for the theory of relativity.
   - He died on **April 18, 1955**.

3. **Compare the death years:**
   - Newton died in **1727**.
   - Einstein died in **1955**.
   - Since 1727 is earlier than 1955, Newton died before Einstein.

4. **Answer the question directly:**
   - The question asks: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?"
   - "Die later than" means to die after someone in time.
   - Since Newton died in 1727 and Einstein died in 1955, Newton did not die later than Einstein; he died earlier.
   - Therefore, the answer is **No**.

**Final Answer: No**
