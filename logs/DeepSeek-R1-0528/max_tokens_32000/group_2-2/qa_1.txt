*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is an elephant heavier than a blue whale?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, and elephants are large but not as big as blue whales. But I should recall specific weights to be accurate.

Let me think about the average weight of an African elephant. African elephants are the largest land animals. I think a male African elephant can weigh up to 6,000 to 12,000 pounds. I should use metric units for consistency, but since the question doesn't specify, I'll use what's common.

In kilograms: An adult male African elephant typically weighs between 5,000 to 6,000 kg. Females are smaller, around 3,000 kg. But for comparison, we usually take the largest or average.

Now, for a blue whale. Blue whales are marine mammals and are much larger. I recall that a blue whale can weigh up to 150,000 kg or more. The average is around 100,000 to 150,000 kg.

Let me double-check these figures.

From memory:

- African elephant: up to 6,000 kg (about 13,000 pounds)

- Blue whale: up to 180,000 kg (about 200 tons). I think the maximum recorded is around 173,000 kg, but averages are less.

Upon second thought, let's use reliable estimates.

I think a large male African elephant might weigh about 5,000 to 6,000 kg. Some sources say up to 7,500 kg, but that's rare.

For blue whales, the average weight is about 100,000 to 150,000 kg, with some reaching 180,000 kg.

Clearly, even the smallest blue whale is heavier than the largest elephant.

But let's be precise.

I recall that the largest blue whale ever recorded weighed 190,000 kg (190 tonnes), but that might be an outlier. Commonly, they are 100-150 tonnes.

1 tonne = 1,000 kg, so 100 tonnes = 100,000 kg.

Elephants: largest land animal, but African elephant max weight is about 10,000 kg? No, I think I have it.

Let me think of standard values:

- African elephant: adult male, 4,000 to 6,000 kg, with some up to 7,500 kg.

- Blue whale: adult, 100,000 to 150,000 kg, with maximum around 180,000 kg.

So, comparing the upper limits: 7,500 kg vs. 180,000 kg. That's like 7.5 tonnes vs. 180 tonnes. Blue whale is over 20 times heavier.

Even comparing average: say 5,000 kg for elephant vs. 120,000 kg for blue whale, still 24 times heavier.

Therefore, an elephant is not heavier than a blue whale; in fact, a blue whale is much heavier.

The question is: "Is an elephant heavier than a blue whale?" So, the answer should be no.

But let me make sure about the weights.

I am considering Asian elephants as well, but they are smaller, around 3,000 to 5,000 kg, so even lighter than African elephants. So, no issue.

Blue whales are the heaviest animals known to have ever existed, even heavier than dinosaurs.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the average or maximum weights of both animals.

2. Compare the weights.

3. Conclude based on the comparison.

Step 1: Weight of an elephant

- The heaviest elephant species is the African bush elephant.

- Adult male African elephant: typically 4,000 to 6,000 kg, with record weights up to 10,400 kg (but that's rare; usually cited as 6,000-7,000 kg max).

Upon recall, the average adult male African elephant weighs about 6,000 kg (6 tonnes).

Step 2: Weight of a blue whale

- Blue whales are the largest animals on Earth.

- Adult blue whale: average weight is 100,000 to 150,000 kg (100 to 150 tonnes).

- Maximum recorded weight is about 173,000 kg or 190,000 kg depending on sources, but consistently over 100 tonnes.

Step 3: Comparison

- Even the heaviest elephant ever recorded is around 10,000 kg, while an average blue whale is 120,000 kg.

- 10,000 kg vs. 120,000 kg: blue whale is 12 times heavier.

- Minimum blue whale might be around 50,000 kg for a young adult, but still heavier than any elephant.

- Elephants don't get heavier than 10,000 kg, blue whales don't get lighter than, say, 80,000 kg as adults. Calves are smaller, but we're comparing adult animals, I assume.

The question doesn't specify age, but it's implied to be typical adults.

So, in all cases, a blue whale is heavier than an elephant.

Therefore, an elephant is not heavier than a blue whale.

Final answer: No.

The question is: "Is an elephant heavier than a blue whale?" So, the answer is no.

And I need to show step-by-step reasoning.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the typical weight range for an elephant:**
   - The heaviest species of elephant is the African bush elephant.
   - Adult male African elephants typically weigh between 4,000 to 6,000 kg (about 4.4 to 6.6 tons).
   - The maximum recorded weight for an African elephant is approximately 10,400 kg (about 11.5 tons), but this is rare and not the norm.
   - For comparison, Asian elephants are smaller, with adult males weighing 3,000 to 5,000 kg (about 3.3 to 5.5 tons).

2. **Identify the typical weight range for a blue whale:**
   - Blue whales are the largest animals on Earth and are marine mammals.
   - Adult blue whales typically weigh between 100,000 to 150,000 kg (about 110 to 165 tons).
   - The maximum recorded weight for a blue whale is about 173,000 kg (about 190 tons), but even average-sized blue whales are significantly heavier than elephants.
   - Blue whale calves are smaller at birth (around 2,700 kg or 3 tons), but the question likely refers to adult animals, as this is the standard comparison.

3. **Compare the weights:**
   - The upper weight limit for an elephant (10,400 kg) is far less than the lower weight limit for an adult blue whale (100,000 kg).
   - Specifically:
     - 10,400 kg (elephant max) vs. 100,000 kg (blue whale min): The blue whale is over 9 times heavier.
     - Average comparison: 6,000 kg (elephant) vs. 120,000 kg (blue whale average): The blue whale is about 20 times heavier.
   - This shows that even the largest elephant ever recorded is lighter than the smallest adult blue whale.

4. **Consider any exceptions:**
   - There are no known species or individuals of elephants that approach the weight of a blue whale. Blue whales are the heaviest animals known to have ever existed, including dinosaurs.
   - Factors like age, health, or subspecies do not change this outcome; elephants are land animals with physical size constraints, while blue whales benefit from the buoyancy of water, allowing for much larger body masses.

**Final Answer: No**  
An elephant is not heavier than a blue whale; in fact, a blue whale is significantly heavier.
