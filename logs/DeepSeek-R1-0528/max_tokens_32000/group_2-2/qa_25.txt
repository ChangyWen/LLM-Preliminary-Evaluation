*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth less than that on the Moon?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that acceleration due to gravity depends on the mass and radius of the celestial body. The formula for acceleration due to gravity on the surface is:

\[ g = \frac{G \times M}{R^2} \]

where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant,
- \( M \) is the mass of the body,
- \( R \) is the radius of the body.

I need to compare \( g_{\text{Earth}} \) and \( g_{\text{Moon}} \).

From memory, Earth's gravity is about 9.8 m/s², and the Moon's gravity is about 1.6 m/s². So, Earth's gravity is stronger, meaning acceleration due to gravity is greater on Earth than on the Moon. But I should confirm with the formula to be thorough.

Let me recall the values:

For Earth:
- Mass, \( M_{\text{Earth}} \approx 5.97 \times 10^{24} \) kg
- Radius, \( R_{\text{Earth}} \approx 6.37 \times 10^6 \) m

For Moon:
- Mass, \( M_{\text{Moon}} \approx 7.35 \times 10^{22} \) kg
- Radius, \( R_{\text{Moon}} \approx 1.74 \times 10^6 \) m

Gravitational constant, \( G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \) m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² (I can use the approximate value for comparison).

Now, calculate \( g_{\text{Earth}} \):

\[ g_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{G \times M_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{Earth}}^2} \]

Plugging in:

First, \( R_{\text{Earth}}^2 = (6.37 \times 10^6)^2 = 4.05769 \times 10^{13} \) m²

Then, \( G \times M_{\text{Earth}} = (6.67430 \times 10^{-11}) \times (5.97 \times 10^{24}) \)

Calculate that: \( 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \times 5.97 \times 10^{24} = 6.67430 \times 5.97 \times 10^{-11+24} = 6.67430 \times 5.97 \times 10^{13} \)

Compute 6.67430 × 5.97:

6.67430 × 6 = 40.0458, but better: 6.67430 × 5 = 33.3715, 6.67430 × 0.97 = approximately 6.474171, so total 33.3715 + 6.474171 = 39.845671

So about 3.9845671 × 10^1 × 10^13, no:

6.67430 × 5.97 ≈ let's do 667430 × 597 / 100000, but easier: 6.6743 × 5.97.

6.6743 × 6 = 40.0458, minus 6.6743 × 0.03 = 0.200229, so 40.0458 - 0.200229 = 39.845571? No:

5.97 = 6 - 0.03, but multiplication: better 6.6743 × 5.97.

Calculate: 6.6743 × 5 = 33.3715

6.6743 × 0.97 = 6.6743 × 1 - 6.6743 × 0.03 = 6.6743 - 0.200229 = 6.474071

So 33.3715 + 6.474071 = 39.845571

Thus, G × M_earth ≈ 3.9845571 × 10^14? No:

39.845571 × 10^13, since 10^{-11} × 10^{24} = 10^{13}, so 3.9845571 × 10^14? 39.845571 × 10^13 = 3.9845571 × 10^14, yes.

Now, R_earth^2 = (6.37e6)^2 = 4.05769e13

So g_earth = (3.9845571e14) / (4.05769e13) = 3.9845571e14 / 4.05769e13 = (3.9845571 / 4.05769) × 10^{14-13} = (3.9845571 / 4.05769) × 10

Compute division: 3.9845571 / 4.05769 ≈ ?

First, both around 4, so approximately 0.982 × something.

4.05769 - 3.9845571 = 0.0731329, so 1 - (0.0731329)/4.05769 ≈ 1 - 0.01802 ≈ 0.98198

Better use calculator in mind.

3.9845571 ÷ 4.05769 ≈ 0.982

Then 0.982 × 10 = 9.82, so g_earth ≈ 9.82 m/s², close to 9.8, good.

Now for Moon:

M_moon = 7.35 × 10^22 kg

R_moon = 1.74 × 10^6 m

First, R_moon^2 = (1.74e6)^2 = 3.0276e12 m²

G × M_moon = 6.67430e-11 × 7.35e22 = 6.67430 × 7.35 × 10^{-11+22} = 6.67430 × 7.35 × 10^{11}

Compute 6.67430 × 7.35

6.67430 × 7 = 46.7201

6.67430 × 0.35 = 2.336005

Total 46.7201 + 2.336005 = 49.056105

So 4.9056105 × 10^1 × 10^{11} = 4.9056105 × 10^{12}

Thus G × M_moon ≈ 4.9056105e12

Now g_moon = (4.9056105e12) / (3.0276e12) = 4.9056105e12 / 3.0276e12 = 4.9056105 / 3.0276

Compute division: 4.9056105 ÷ 3.0276

3.0276 × 1.6 = 4.84416

4.9056105 - 4.84416 = 0.0614505

Now 0.0614505 / 3.0276 ≈ 0.02029

So total ≈ 1.62029

Thus g_moon ≈ 1.62 m/s², which matches the known value.

Now, comparing g_earth ≈ 9.8 m/s² and g_moon ≈ 1.6 m/s², clearly g_earth > g_moon.

The question is: "Is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth less than that on the Moon?"

Since 9.8 > 1.6, it is not less; it is greater.

So the answer should be No.

I could think in terms of ratios.

g_earth / g_moon = [ (G M_earth / R_earth^2) ] / [ (G M_moon / R_moon^2) ] = (M_earth / M_moon) × (R_moon / R_earth)^2

M_earth / M_moon = 5.97e24 / 7.35e22 = 5.97e24 / 7.35e22 = (5.97 / 7.35) × 10^{2} = (0.8122) × 100 = 81.22

Approximately 81.22

R_moon / R_earth = 1.74e6 / 6.37e6 = 1.74 / 6.37 ≈ 0.27315

Then (R_moon / R_earth)^2 ≈ (0.27315)^2 ≈ 0.074612

Then g_earth / g_moon = 81.22 × 0.074612 ≈ ?

First, 81.22 × 0.07 = 5.6854

81.22 × 0.004 = 0.32488

81.22 × 0.0006 = 0.048732

81.22 × 0.000012 = approximately 0.00097464

Better: 0.074612 = 0.0746

81.22 × 0.0746

80 × 0.0746 = 5.968

1.22 × 0.0746 ≈ 1.22 × 0.07 = 0.0854, 1.22 × 0.0046 = 0.005612, total 0.091012

So 5.968 + 0.091012 = 6.059012

Thus g_earth / g_moon ≈ 6.06

So g_earth is about 6 times g_moon, so g_earth > g_moon.

Therefore, acceleration due to gravity on Earth is not less than on the Moon; it is greater.

Final answer: No.

The question is specifically "less than", so since it's greater, it's not less.

I think that's solid.

But just to be thorough, is there any point or condition where gravity on Earth could be less? No, on the surface, Earth has higher gravity.

Maybe in orbit or something, but the question is about "on Earth" and "on the Moon", meaning on their surfaces.

So, no doubt.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks whether the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is less than that on the Moon. This requires comparing the gravitational accelerations at the surfaces of both bodies.

2. **Relevant Formula**: The acceleration due to gravity \(g\) on the surface of a celestial body is given by the formula:
   \[
   g = \frac{G \cdot M}{R^2}
   \]
   where:
   - \(G\) is the gravitational constant (\(6.67430 \times 10^{-11}  \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}\)),
   - \(M\) is the mass of the body,
   - \(R\) is the radius of the body.

3. **Key Values**:
   - **Earth**:
     - Mass \(M_{\text{Earth}} = 5.97 \times 10^{24}  \text{kg}\),
     - Radius \(R_{\text{Earth}} = 6.37 \times 10^{6}  \text{m}\).
   - **Moon**:
     - Mass \(M_{\text{Moon}} = 7.35 \times 10^{22}  \text{kg}\),
     - Radius \(R_{\text{Moon}} = 1.74 \times 10^{6}  \text{m}\).

4. **Calculate \(g_{\text{Earth}}\)**:
   - First, compute \(R_{\text{Earth}}^2\):
     \[
     R_{\text{Earth}}^2 = (6.37 \times 10^{6})^2 = 4.05769 \times 10^{13}  \text{m}^2
     \]
   - Then, compute \(G \cdot M_{\text{Earth}}\):
     \[
     G \cdot M_{\text{Earth}} = (6.67430 \times 10^{-11}) \times (5.97 \times 10^{24}) = 3.9846 \times 10^{14}  \text{m}^3 \text{s}^{-2}
     \]
   - Now, solve for \(g_{\text{Earth}}\):
     \[
     g_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{3.9846 \times 10^{14}}{4.05769 \times 10^{13}} \approx 9.82  \text{m/s}^2
     \]
   - This is approximately \(9.8  \text{m/s}^2\), which matches the standard value.

5. **Calculate \(g_{\text{Moon}}\)**:
   - First, compute \(R_{\text{Moon}}^2\):
     \[
     R_{\text{Moon}}^2 = (1.74 \times 10^{6})^2 = 3.0276 \times 10^{12}  \text{m}^2
     \]
   - Then, compute \(G \cdot M_{\text{Moon}}\):
     \[
     G \cdot M_{\text{Moon}} = (6.67430 \times 10^{-11}) \times (7.35 \times 10^{22}) = 4.9056 \times 10^{12}  \text{m}^3 \text{s}^{-2}
     \]
   - Now, solve for \(g_{\text{Moon}}\):
     \[
     g_{\text{Moon}} = \frac{4.9056 \times 10^{12}}{3.0276 \times 10^{12}} \approx 1.62  \text{m/s}^2
     \]
   - This is approximately \(1.6  \text{m/s}^2\), which matches the standard value.

6. **Comparison**:
   - \(g_{\text{Earth}} \approx 9.8  \text{m/s}^2\)
   - \(g_{\text{Moon}} \approx 1.6  \text{m/s}^2\)
   - Since \(9.8 > 1.6\), \(g_{\text{Earth}}\) is greater than \(g_{\text{Moon}}\).

7. **Answer the Question**: The question asks if acceleration due to gravity on Earth is less than on the Moon. Based on the calculations, it is not less; it is greater.

**Final Answer: No**
