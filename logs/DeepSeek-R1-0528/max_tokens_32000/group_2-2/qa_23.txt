*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. It ranges from 0 to 14. A pH less than 7 is acidic, pH 7 is neutral, and pH greater than 7 is basic.

Water is neutral, so its pH should be around 7. Specifically, pure water at 25°C has a pH of 7.

Lemon juice is acidic because it contains citric acid. I think lemon juice has a low pH, meaning it's acidic.

I recall that lemon juice has a pH between 2 and 3. Let me confirm that. Yes, typically, lemon juice is around pH 2.0 to 2.5. That's quite acidic.

So, water has a pH of 7, and lemon juice has a pH of about 2.

Now, pH is logarithmic, so lower pH means more acidic. Therefore, lemon juice has a lower pH than water.

The question is: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?"

If lemon juice has a lower pH than water, that means water has a higher pH than lemon juice. So, the pH of water is not lower; it's higher.

Let me phrase it carefully.

Let pH_water = 7

pH_lemon_juice ≈ 2

Since 7 > 2, pH_water is greater than pH_lemon_juice.

Therefore, the pH of water is not lower than that of lemon juice; it's higher.

So, the answer should be No.

The question says: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?" So, is pH_water < pH_lemon_juice?

pH_water is 7, pH_lemon_juice is 2, so 7 < 2? No, that's false.

Therefore, the answer is No.

I should make sure about the pH values.

Is pure water always pH 7? Yes, at standard conditions.

Lemon juice: yes, it's acidic. Common knowledge.

If I think about it, vinegar has a pH around 2.4, and lemon juice is similar or slightly more acidic. Lemon juice is often cited as pH 2.0 to 2.8.

Water: distilled water is pH 7, but tap water might be slightly different due to dissolved minerals, but generally, we consider pure water as pH 7 for such comparisons.

The question probably implies pure water or standard water.

Lemon juice is also a standard reference for acidity.

So, no doubt here.

Therefore, step-by-step reasoning:

1. pH measures acidity: lower pH means more acidic.

2. Pure water is neutral with pH 7.

3. Lemon juice is acidic with pH around 2-3.

4. Since 7 is greater than 2-3, water has higher pH than lemon juice.

5. Thus, pH of water is not lower than that of lemon juice.

Final answer: No.

The question asks for "Yes or No" to "is pH of water lower?"

So, No.

I think that's it.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand pH Scale**: The pH scale measures how acidic or basic a substance is, ranging from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral (like pure water), values below 7 are acidic, and values above 7 are basic. Lower pH values indicate higher acidity.

2. **pH of Water**: Pure water at 25°C has a pH of 7, as it is neutral. This is a standard reference point.

3. **pH of Lemon Juice**: Lemon juice is acidic due to its high citric acid content. The typical pH range for lemon juice is between 2.0 and 2.5, depending on factors like concentration and ripeness. For comparison:
   - A pH of 2.0–2.5 is highly acidic (e.g., similar to vinegar or gastric acid).

4. **Compare pH Values**:
   - Water pH: 7.0
   - Lemon juice pH: ≈2.0–2.5
   - Since 7.0 is greater than 2.5 (or any value in the 2.0–2.5 range), water has a higher pH than lemon juice.

5. **Answer the Question**: The question asks if the pH of water is lower than that of lemon juice. This would require water's pH (7) to be less than lemon juice's pH (≈2–2.5). However, 7 is not less than 2–2.5; it is greater. Therefore, the pH of water is not lower—it is higher.

**Final Answer: No**
