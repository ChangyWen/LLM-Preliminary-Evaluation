*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the boiling point of water lower than the melting point of ice?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the boiling point of water is the temperature at which water turns into steam, and the melting point of ice is the temperature at which ice turns into water. Both are typically measured at standard atmospheric pressure, which is 1 atmosphere.

The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius, and the melting point of ice is 0 degrees Celsius. I should confirm these values because the question might be tricky.

Water boils at 100°C and freezes (or melts) at 0°C under standard conditions. So, 100°C is higher than 0°C, meaning the boiling point is higher than the melting point.

The question asks if the boiling point is lower than the melting point. Based on this, 100°C is not lower than 0°C; it's higher. So, the answer should be no.

But let me make sure there's no trick here. Is there any condition where the boiling point could be lower than the melting point? For example, under different pressures.

I recall that at lower pressures, like at high altitudes, the boiling point decreases. For instance, on Mount Everest, water boils at around 70°C. But the melting point also changes with pressure, but not as dramatically.

The melting point of ice decreases slightly with increasing pressure, but it's a small effect. For example, at very high pressures, ice can have different forms, but under normal conditions, it's stable.

Specifically, for water, the melting point decreases with increasing pressure, but only by a small amount. For instance, at 1 atmosphere, it's 0°C, and at higher pressures, it might be slightly lower, like -1°C or something, but not significantly.

The boiling point changes more with pressure. At lower pressures, boiling point drops significantly.

But in standard conditions, we compare 100°C and 0°C.

The question doesn't specify pressure, so I should assume standard atmospheric pressure.

Moreover, for water, the boiling point is always higher than the melting point under all normal conditions. I think it's impossible for the boiling point to be lower than the melting point because that would imply that water boils before it melts, which doesn't make sense.

If the boiling point were lower than the melting point, that would mean that solid ice would turn directly into vapor without becoming liquid first, which is sublimation. But for water, sublimation occurs below the melting point under certain conditions, but the boiling point is for the liquid, so it's different.

For example, dry ice (CO2) sublimes because its triple point is above atmospheric pressure, so at 1 atm, solid turns directly to gas. But for water, the triple point is at 0.01°C and 611.657 Pa, which is below 1 atm, so at 1 atm, water has distinct solid, liquid, and gas phases.

At 1 atm, water melts at 0°C and boils at 100°C, so melting point is 0°C, boiling point is 100°C.

Therefore, boiling point (100°C) is greater than melting point (0°C), so it is not lower.

The question is: "Is the boiling point lower than the melting point?" So, since 100 > 0, the answer is no.

But let me phrase it carefully. Boiling point is 100°C, melting point is 0°C, so boiling point is higher, not lower.

Perhaps I should consider the values in Kelvin to be precise.

Melting point of ice: 0°C = 273.15 K

Boiling point of water: 100°C = 373.15 K

373.15 K > 273.15 K, so boiling point is higher.

Is there any substance where boiling point is lower than melting point? Yes, like CO2 or iodine, but for water, no.

The question specifically says "water" and "ice", so it's about H2O.

Therefore, for water, boiling point is not lower than melting point.

Final answer should be no.

But the question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning", so I need to outline it.

Step 1: Recall the definition. The boiling point of water is the temperature at which liquid water turns to vapor at a given pressure. The melting point of ice is the temperature at which solid ice turns to liquid water.

Step 2: Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), the boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius.

Step 3: Under the same pressure, the melting point of ice is 0 degrees Celsius.

Step 4: Compare the values: 100°C is greater than 0°C, so the boiling point is higher than the melting point.

Step 5: Therefore, the boiling point is not lower than the melting point.

Step 6: Answer the question: No.

To be thorough, I should consider if pressure affects this.

At different pressures, both points change, but the boiling point decreases with decreasing pressure, while the melting point increases slightly with decreasing pressure? No.

For water, the melting point decreases with increasing pressure because water expands when it freezes. So, with increasing pressure, melting point decreases slightly.

But with decreasing pressure, melting point increases slightly.

Similarly, boiling point decreases with decreasing pressure.

For example, at high altitude, lower pressure, boiling point is lower, say 95°C or something, but melting point is still around 0°C, maybe 0.1°C higher or something, but it's negligible.

Even at very low pressures, say in a vacuum, water might boil at room temperature, but ice would also sublimate.

But the melting point is defined for the solid to liquid transition.

At pressures below the triple point pressure (611 Pa), liquid water is not stable, so you can't have a boiling point for liquid because it doesn't exist; instead, solid sublimes directly to vapor.

But at standard atmospheric pressure, which is about 101325 Pa, well above the triple point pressure, so both melting and boiling points are defined.

And at 1 atm, boiling point is 100°C, melting point is 0°C.

Even if we consider non-standard pressures, as long as pressure is above the triple point, the boiling point is always higher than the melting point for water.

For example, at the triple point, both are approximately 0.01°C, but boiling and melting are the same point only at the triple point, but even there, it's the same temperature, not lower.

At triple point, the temperature is 0.01°C, and both melting and boiling (or sublimation) occur at that temperature under that specific pressure.

But for melting point, at triple point pressure, it's 0.01°C, and boiling point at that pressure is also the same because it's the point where all phases coexist.

But under higher pressures, like 1 atm, melting point is slightly lower? No.

At triple point pressure (611 Pa), melting point is 0.01°C.

At higher pressure, say 1 atm (101325 Pa), the melting point decreases slightly. I think it's about -0.0076°C per atmosphere or something, but it's very small.

The formula for melting point depression with pressure: dT/dP = -T ΔV / ΔH, but for water, ΔV is negative, so dT/dP is positive? Let's think.

Water expands when freezing, so ΔV (volume change) is negative when going from liquid to solid? No.

When ice melts, volume decreases, so ΔV = V_liquid - V_solid < 0.

And ΔH (enthalpy of fusion) > 0.

So dT/dP = T ΔV / ΔH, with ΔV < 0, so dT/dP < 0, meaning melting point decreases with increasing pressure.

For example, at 1 atm, melting point is approximately 0.0024°C lower than at triple point, but it's negligible; we say 0°C.

Similarly, boiling point at 1 atm is 100°C.

But at no pressure above triple point is boiling point lower than melting point for water.

For instance, at 1 atm, melting point ~0°C, boiling point 100°C.

At higher pressures, boiling point increases, melting point decreases slightly, so boiling point is even higher.

At lower pressures, boiling point decreases, melting point increases slightly.

Say at 0.5 atm, boiling point might be around 82°C or so, and melting point might be 0.01°C or something, still 82 > 0.01.

At pressures just above triple point, say 612 Pa, boiling point is close to 0.01°C, and melting point is also around 0.01°C, but not lower.

So, for water, boiling point is always greater than or equal to the melting point, but never less.

Therefore, under all conditions, the boiling point of water is not lower than the melting point of ice.

So, the answer to the question is no.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Definitions**:
   - The **boiling point** of water is the temperature at which liquid water turns into vapor (steam) at a given pressure.
   - The **melting point** of ice is the temperature at which solid ice turns into liquid water at a given pressure.
   - Both points are typically referenced under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.325 kPa) unless otherwise specified.

2. **Recall Standard Values**:
   - Under standard atmospheric pressure:
     - The boiling point of water is **100°C** (or 373.15 K).
     - The melting point of ice is **0°C** (or 273.15 K).

3. **Compare the Values**:
   - Numerically, 100°C is greater than 0°C (100 > 0).
   - Therefore, the boiling point (100°C) is higher than the melting point (0°C).

4. **Consider Pressure Effects**:
   - The boiling point of water decreases with decreasing pressure (e.g., at high altitudes, it can be as low as 70°C).
   - The melting point of ice is less sensitive to pressure changes. It decreases slightly with increasing pressure due to water's unique property of expanding upon freezing (e.g., at very high pressures, it may decrease by a fraction of a degree).
   - However, under all realistic conditions (including variations in pressure), the boiling point of water is never lower than the melting point of ice. For example:
     - At lower pressures (e.g., 0.5 atm), boiling point might be ~82°C, while melting point remains near 0°C (82 > 0).
     - At the triple point (611.657 Pa and 0.01°C), both points coincide at approximately 0.01°C, but the boiling point is not lower.
   - No pressure exists where the boiling point is below the melting point for water, as this would imply sublimation (solid to vapor without liquid phase), which is not the case for water under standard or typical conditions.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since 100°C (boiling point) is greater than 0°C (melting point) under standard conditions, and this relationship holds under all pressures where liquid water exists, the boiling point of water is not lower than the melting point of ice.

**Final Answer: No**
