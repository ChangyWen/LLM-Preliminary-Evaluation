*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the Gobi Desert hotter than the Sahara Desert?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that both are deserts, but they have different climates. The Sahara is the largest hot desert in the world, located in North Africa. The Gobi Desert is in Asia, covering parts of northern China and southern Mongolia.

Deserts can be hot or cold. The Sahara is known for being extremely hot, with some of the highest temperatures recorded on Earth. For example, temperatures in the Sahara can reach over 50°C (122°F) during the day.

The Gobi Desert, on the other hand, is a cold desert. It has extreme temperatures, but it's not primarily hot. In fact, it can be very cold in winter, with temperatures dropping below freezing, and hot in summer, but not as consistently hot as the Sahara.

I should compare average temperatures. Let me recall some data.

- Sahara Desert: Average high temperatures in summer can be around 38-40°C (100-104°F), and in winter, it can be cooler but still relatively warm compared to cold deserts. The Sahara has a hot desert climate.

- Gobi Desert: It has a continental climate with greater temperature extremes. Summer temperatures can reach up to 40°C (104°F), but winter temperatures can plummet to -40°C (-40°F). So, on average, the Gobi is colder.

The question is specifically about whether it's hotter. I think it means overall hotter, or perhaps in terms of peak temperatures.

But let's look at the annual average temperature.

- Sahara: The average annual temperature is around 30°C (86°F) in many parts.

- Gobi: The average annual temperature is much lower. I think it's around 2-3°C (36°F) or something like that. Since it's a cold desert, the average is colder.

For instance, the Gobi has an average annual temperature of about 2.5°C to 7.5°C (36.5°F to 45.5°F), depending on the region. In contrast, the Sahara has averages around 25-30°C (77-86°F).

That means the Sahara is significantly hotter on average.

Now, for peak temperatures: Both can have high temperatures in summer. Sahara can hit 50°C+, and Gobi can hit around 40-45°C, but it's less common. Sahara holds the record for high temperatures; for example, the highest recorded temperature in the Sahara is about 58°C (136°F) in El Azizia, Libya, but that record was invalidated; still, it gets very hot. Currently, Death Valley holds the world record, but Sahara is up there.

Gobi's highest recorded temperature is around 45°C (113°F), which is hot but not as hot as Sahara's peaks.

Moreover, the Sahara has more consistent heat throughout the year, while the Gobi has very cold winters.

So, overall, the Sahara is hotter.

The question says "hotter," which might be interpreted as having higher temperatures, so I should compare summer temperatures or something.

But I think in common parlance, when we say one desert is hotter than another, we mean it generally has higher temperatures.

Perhaps I should think about the definition. Deserts are defined by low precipitation, not temperature, so both are arid, but temperature-wise, Sahara is hot, Gobi is cold.

Yes, that's key: the Gobi is classified as a cold desert because of its temperature extremes and low precipitation, while the Sahara is a hot desert.

Therefore, the Gobi Desert is not hotter than the Sahara; in fact, it's cooler.

Final answer should be No.

But let me double-check with some sources from memory.

I recall that in the Gobi, temperatures can vary widely, but the average is lower. For example, Ulaanbaatar, which is near the Gobi, is one of the coldest capitals, but it's not directly in the Gobi. Still, the region is cold.

Specific Gobi data: According to what I know, the average summer temperature in the Gobi is about 25-30°C, but can go higher, while in Sahara, summer averages are higher, like 35-40°C.

Also, winter: Gobi can be -20 to -30°C, Sahara might be 10-20°C in winter.

So annually, Sahara is warmer.

Therefore, the Gobi Desert is not hotter than the Sahara Desert.

So, the answer is No.

The question is: "Is the Gobi Desert hotter than the Sahara Desert?" and I need to say Yes or No.

Based on reasoning, it's No.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the deserts: Sahara is in North Africa, Gobi is in Asia.

2. Climate types: Sahara has a hot desert climate with high temperatures year-round. Gobi has a cold desert climate with large temperature variations between summer and winter.

3. Temperature comparison:
   - Average annual temperature: Sahara ~25-30°C, Gobi ~2-7°C.
   - Peak summer temperatures: Sahara can exceed 50°C, Gobi reaches about 40-45°C.
   - Winter temperatures: Sahara mild to warm, Gobi very cold.

4. Conclusion: The Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert overall and in terms of extreme heat. Therefore, the Gobi is not hotter.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether the Gobi Desert is hotter than the Sahara Desert. "Hotter" likely refers to overall average temperatures or typical peak temperatures, as both deserts experience seasonal variations.

2. **Climate Classification**:
   - The **Sahara Desert** is classified as a "hot desert" due to its consistently high temperatures year-round. It is located in North Africa and is the world's largest hot desert.
   - The **Gobi Desert** is classified as a "cold desert" because it experiences extreme temperature variations, with very cold winters and hot summers. It is located in northern China and southern Mongolia.

3. **Temperature Data Comparison**:
   - **Sahara Desert**:
     - Average annual temperature: Approximately 25–30°C (77–86°F).
     - Summer (daytime) highs: Often exceed 40°C (104°F), with records above 50°C (122°F). For example, in some areas like Algeria or Libya, temperatures regularly reach 45–50°C.
     - Winter temperatures: Generally mild, averaging 15–25°C (59–77°F) during the day, with cooler nights but rarely below freezing.
   - **Gobi Desert**:
     - Average annual temperature: Approximately 2–7°C (36–45°F), significantly lower than the Sahara.
     - Summer (daytime) highs: Can reach 35–40°C (95–104°F) in some areas, but this is not as consistently high as the Sahara.
     - Winter temperatures: Often drop below freezing, with averages around -20°C (-4°F) to -30°C (-22°F) and records as low as -40°C (-40°F).

4. **Key Factors Influencing Heat**:
   - **Consistency of Heat**: The Sahara maintains high temperatures throughout the year due to its low latitude, subtropical high-pressure system, and minimal cloud cover. The Gobi, being at a higher latitude and elevation (partly on a plateau), has a continental climate with greater seasonal extremes.
   - **Record Temperatures**: The Sahara has recorded some of the highest temperatures on Earth (e.g., 58°C in El Azizia, Libya, though disputed; reliable records show 50–55°C). The Gobi's highest recorded temperature is around 45°C (113°F), which is lower than the Sahara's peaks.
   - **Annual Averages**: Based on meteorological data, the Sahara's average annual temperature is about 20°C (36°F) higher than the Gobi's, making it significantly hotter overall.

5. **Conclusion from Data**: The Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert in terms of average annual temperatures, typical summer highs, and overall heat consistency. While the Gobi can have hot summer days, it is not hotter than the Sahara when considering the full year or extreme heat records.

**Final Answer: No**
