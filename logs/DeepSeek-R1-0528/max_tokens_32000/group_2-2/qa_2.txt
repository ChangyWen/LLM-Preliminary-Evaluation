*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world. Its height is about 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. That's the standard measurement.

Now, K2 is another major mountain. It's in the Karakoram range, and I think it's the second highest mountain in the world. I recall that K2 is around 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) tall. I should confirm these numbers.

Let me think about reliable sources. Mount Everest's height is well-established. The latest measurement I remember is 8,848.86 meters, but for simplicity, we use 8,848 meters.

For K2, I think it's 8,611 meters. I should be precise. I believe K2 is also known as Mount Godwin-Austen, and its height is generally accepted as 8,611 meters.

Now, comparing the two: 8,848 meters vs. 8,611 meters. Clearly, 8,848 is greater than 8,611, so Mount Everest is taller.

But let me double-check the heights to be sure.

I recall that there was a recent remeasurement of Mount Everest. In 2020, China and Nepal jointly announced a new height of 8,848.86 meters. But again, it's still about 8,849 meters rounded.

For K2, the height is 8,611 meters. I think that's standard.

Is there any source that might say K2 is taller? I don't think so. K2 is often called the "Savage Mountain" because it's harder to climb, but it's not taller.

Another thing: sometimes people confuse base to peak height. For example, Mauna Kea in Hawaii is taller from base to peak, but its summit is above sea level is lower than Everest's. But here, the question is about height above sea level, I assume.

The question doesn't specify, but in common parlance, when we say "taller" for mountains, we mean elevation above sea level.

So, Everest: approximately 8,849 m

K2: approximately 8,611 m

Difference is about 238 meters, so Everest is taller.

I can think in feet too, to confirm.

Everest: 29,032 feet (approximately)

K2: 28,251 feet

Yes, 29,032 > 28,251, so Everest is taller.

Therefore, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.

The question is: "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?" Based on this, the answer should be No.

But let me make sure about K2's height. Is it exactly 8,611?

Upon second thought, I think K2 might be listed as 8,612 meters or something, but it's still less than Everest.

Some sources: Wikipedia says K2 is 8,611 m (28,251 ft), and Everest is 8,848.86 m (29,031.7 ft).

So, no doubt.

Perhaps in terms of prominence or something, but prominence is different. Prominence is about how much a mountain rises independently. Everest has the highest prominence, but K2 also has high prominence, but height-wise, Everest is taller.

The question is straightforward about height.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the heights:

   - Mount Everest height: 8,848 meters (or approximately 8,849 m)

   - K2 height: 8,611 meters

2. Compare the numbers: 8,848 > 8,611

3. Therefore, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

4. Hence, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.

Final answer: No.

The question is: "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?" So, since K2 is shorter, the answer is No.

I think that's it.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether K2 is taller than Mount Everest. This requires comparing their heights above sea level, as this is the standard metric for measuring mountain height.

2. **Recall Standard Heights**:
   - Mount Everest is widely recognized as the highest mountain on Earth. Its most recent official height, as jointly announced by China and Nepal in 2020, is **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)**.
   - K2, also known as Mount Godwin-Austen, is the second-highest mountain on Earth. Its widely accepted height is **8,611 meters (28,251 feet)**, based on surveys from sources like the Survey of Pakistan and international geographic authorities.

3. **Compare the Heights**:
   - Convert both heights to the same unit for clarity (meters):
     - Mount Everest: 8,848.86 meters
     - K2: 8,611 meters
   - Subtract K2's height from Mount Everest's height to find the difference:
     - 8,848.86 m - 8,611 m = 237.86 meters
   - Since 8,848.86 meters is greater than 8,611 meters, Mount Everest is taller by approximately 238 meters.

4. **Consider Potential Confusions**:
   - **Above Sea Level vs. Base to Summit**: The question is about height above sea level, not base-to-summit prominence. For example, Mauna Kea in Hawaii has a greater base-to-summit height but a lower summit elevation above sea level. However, for K2 and Everest, the comparison is based on sea-level elevation.
   - **Recent Measurements**: There have been no significant changes to the accepted heights of either mountain. Everest's 2020 remeasurement confirmed its height, and K2's height remains consistent at 8,611 meters.
   - **Misconceptions**: K2 is sometimes called the "Savage Mountain" due to its difficulty to climb, but this does not affect its height. It is not taller than Everest.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on verified geographic data, K2 is shorter than Mount Everest.

**Final Answer: No**
