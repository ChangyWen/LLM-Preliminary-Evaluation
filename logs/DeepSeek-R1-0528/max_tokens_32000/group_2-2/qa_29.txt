*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the wavelength of blue light longer than that of red light?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I remember that light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. Visible light ranges from violet to red, with violet having the shortest wavelength and red having the longest.

Let me recall the order of colors in the visible spectrum. It's often remembered by the acronym ROYGBIV: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. Red has the longest wavelength, and violet has the shortest.

Blue light is towards the shorter wavelength end compared to red. Red light has wavelengths around 620-750 nanometers, and blue light has wavelengths around 450-495 nanometers. Let me be precise.

Typical wavelength ranges:

- Red light: approximately 620-750 nm

- Blue light: approximately 450-495 nm

So, comparing the average or any value within these ranges, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light. For example:

- Average red wavelength: around 650 nm

- Average blue wavelength: around 475 nm

Clearly, 650 nm is greater than 475 nm, so red light has a longer wavelength.

The question is: "Is the wavelength of blue light longer than that of red light?" So, if blue light has a longer wavelength than red light? No, that's not true. Blue light has a shorter wavelength.

Wavelength and frequency are inversely related by the speed of light: c = λν, where c is speed, λ is wavelength, ν is frequency.

Since the speed of light is constant, shorter wavelength means higher frequency.

Blue light has a higher frequency than red light because it has a shorter wavelength.

Therefore, blue light does not have a longer wavelength; it has a shorter one.

Final answer should be No.

Now, to structure my response: I need to show step-by-step reasoning and then the final answer.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall the visible light spectrum: Red light has the longest wavelengths in the visible spectrum, while blue light has shorter wavelengths.

2. Specifically, red light wavelengths range from about 620 nm to 750 nm, and blue light wavelengths range from about 450 nm to 495 nm.

3. Since 450-495 nm is less than 620-750 nm, blue light has shorter wavelengths than red light.

4. Therefore, the wavelength of blue light is not longer than that of red light; it is shorter.

Final answer: No.

The question is phrased as: "Is the wavelength of blue light longer than that of red light?" So, answering "No" means it is not longer, which is correct.

I should make sure there's no trick here. Is there any context where blue light could have a longer wavelength? I don't think so; this is standard physics.

Also, in terms of color perception, red is associated with longer wavelengths, blue with shorter.

Yes, I'm confident.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the electromagnetic spectrum**: Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. The visible spectrum ranges from approximately 380 nanometers (nm) to 750 nm.

2. **Recall the order of colors by wavelength**: 
   - Red light has the longest wavelengths in the visible spectrum, typically ranging from about 620 nm to 750 nm.
   - Blue light has shorter wavelengths, typically ranging from about 450 nm to 495 nm.

3. **Compare the wavelength ranges**:
   - The maximum wavelength for blue light (495 nm) is still shorter than the minimum wavelength for red light (620 nm).
   - For example:
     - Average blue light wavelength: ~475 nm.
     - Average red light wavelength: ~650 nm.
   - Since 475 nm < 650 nm, blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light.

4. **Confirm the inverse relationship with frequency**: 
   - Wavelength (λ) and frequency (ν) are related by the speed of light (c): \( c = \lambda \nu \), where c is constant (~3 × 10^8 m/s).
   - Blue light has a higher frequency than red light, which confirms it has a shorter wavelength.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the established properties of the visible spectrum, blue light does not have a longer wavelength than red light; it has a shorter wavelength.

### Final Answer:
No
