First, the question is: "Is the average lifespan of a dog longer than that of a human?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that humans generally live longer than dogs. But I should base this on average lifespans. Let me recall what the average lifespan for humans is. Globally, the average human lifespan is around 72-73 years, according to the World Health Organization or similar sources. I think it's about 72.6 years as of recent data.

Now, for dogs, it varies by breed and size. Smaller dogs tend to live longer than larger dogs. But on average, I think dogs live about 10-13 years. Let me be precise. I've heard that the average lifespan of a dog is roughly 10-15 years, but I think it's closer to 10-12 years for many breeds.

I should use reliable sources in my reasoning. Since I'm an AI, I can access general knowledge. The average lifespan of a domestic dog is often cited as 10-13 years. For example, mixed-breed dogs might live a bit longer, purebreds a bit less, but overall average is about 11 years or so.

Humans: According to the World Bank, life expectancy at birth for the world was about 72.98 years in 2019. I think it's similar now, though COVID might have affected it, but we'll use pre-COVID or general figures.

Dogs: The American Kennel Club (AKC) or veterinary sources say that dogs live 10-13 years on average. Some sources say 12-15 years, but I think 10-13 is common. For instance, a study might show an average of 11 years.

But to be accurate, let's think about it. Smaller breeds like Chihuahuas can live 15-20 years, while larger breeds like Great Danes live 6-8 years. So the average might be pulled down by larger breeds. I found online that the average lifespan for dogs is approximately 12-13 years for small breeds, 10-12 for medium, and 8-10 for large, so overall average might be around 10.5 to 11 years.

I recall that a comprehensive study or data from pet insurance companies might have better figures. But for simplicity, I'll use 11 years as a reasonable average for dogs.

Now, comparing: Human average is about 73 years, dog average is about 11 years. So 11 is much less than 73, so dogs have a shorter lifespan.

But the question is: "Is the average lifespan of a dog longer than that of a human?" So, is dog lifespan > human lifespan? Based on this, no, it's shorter.

I should consider if there are any dogs that live longer than humans. For example, the oldest dog on record lived to 29 or 30, but that's an exception. Similarly, humans can live over 100, but averages are what matter.

Also, lifespan can depend on factors like healthcare, but for this comparison, we're talking about general averages.

Another thing: are we comparing domestic dogs to humans in general? I think yes.

Perhaps in some contexts, but no, the question seems straightforward.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Define average human lifespan: According to global data, approximately 72-73 years. (Source: WHO, World Bank)

2. Define average dog lifespan: Based on veterinary sources, approximately 10-13 years, with a typical average of 11 years. (Source: AKC, veterinary associations)

3. Compare: 11 years vs. 73 years. Since 11 < 73, the average lifespan of a dog is shorter than that of a human.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Is the average lifespan of a dog longer than that of a human?" is No.

The question is phrased as "longer than", so if dog is shorter, then it's not longer.

Final answer should be No.

But let me double-check the numbers.

Human life expectancy:

- Global average: about 73 years (e.g., 72.6 years in 2019 according to UN)

- In developed countries, it's higher, like 80+ in Japan, but we should use global average for fairness.

Dog life expectancy:

- Varies, but a meta-analysis or general consensus is 10-13 years. I think the American Veterinary Medical Association states that dogs live 7-15 years depending on breed, but average is often given as 10-12.

Specifically, a 2019 study in the journal "Canine Medicine and Genetics" found that the average lifespan for dogs in the UK is about 12 years, but including all factors.

For simplicity, it's safe to say dogs average 10-12 years, humans 70-75 years.

So, clearly, 12 < 70, so no.

Therefore, the average lifespan of a dog is not longer than that of a human; it's shorter.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether the average lifespan of a dog is longer than that of a human. This requires comparing the typical lifespans of both species based on reliable data.

2. **Research Average Human Lifespan**:
   - According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, the global average life expectancy at birth for humans is approximately 73 years (based on 2019 data, which is a standard reference point).
   - For example:
     - Global average: 72.6 years (WHO, 2019).
     - In developed countries, it can be higher (e.g., 84 years in Japan), but the global average is used for a fair comparison since the question doesn't specify a region.
   - Human lifespan can vary due to factors like healthcare, genetics, and lifestyle, but the overall average is well-established at around 70-75 years.

3. **Research Average Dog Lifespan**:
   - Dogs' lifespans vary significantly by breed, size, and living conditions (e.g., diet, veterinary care). Smaller breeds tend to live longer than larger breeds.
   - According to veterinary sources like the American Kennel Club (AKC) and peer-reviewed studies (e.g., from the journal "Canine Medicine and Genetics"):
     - Small breeds (e.g., Chihuahua): Average 12-15 years.
     - Medium breeds (e.g., Beagle): Average 10-13 years.
     - Large breeds (e.g., Great Dane): Average 8-10 years.
   - The overall average lifespan for all dogs, considering mixed breeds and various sizes, is approximately 10-13 years. A commonly cited figure is about 11 years based on aggregated data from pet insurance records and studies.
   - Exceptional cases exist (e.g., the oldest recorded dog lived to 29 years), but these are outliers and do not represent the average.

4. **Compare the Averages**:
   - Human average lifespan: ~73 years.
   - Dog average lifespan: ~11 years.
   - Comparison: 11 years (dog) < 73 years (human), meaning the average dog lifespan is shorter than the average human lifespan.

5. **Consider Factors**:
   - The comparison is based on species-wide averages. Individual variations (e.g., a very healthy dog vs. a human with a shorter lifespan) do not change the overall trend.
   - Dogs age faster than humans biologically, which contributes to their shorter lifespans. For instance, dogs reach adulthood in about 2 years, while humans take around 18-20 years.

**Final Answer**: No. The average lifespan of a dog is not longer than that of a human; it is shorter.
