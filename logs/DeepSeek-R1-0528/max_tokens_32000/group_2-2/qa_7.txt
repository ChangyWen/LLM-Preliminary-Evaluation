*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is a lion faster than a cheetah?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that cheetahs are known for being the fastest land animals. They can run very fast in short bursts. Lions are also fast, but I think cheetahs are faster.

Let me recall some facts. Cheetahs can reach speeds up to 60-70 miles per hour (mph) or about 97-113 kilometers per hour (km/h). Lions, on the other hand, can run up to 50 mph or 80 km/h, but they are not as fast as cheetahs.

I should confirm these speeds. From what I remember:

- Cheetah top speed: around 70-75 mph (112-120 km/h)

- Lion top speed: around 50 mph (80 km/h)

Yes, that sounds right. Cheetahs are built for speed with their lightweight bodies, long legs, and flexible spines. Lions are more powerful but not as fast.

The question is specifically about speed, so I should focus on that.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the key attribute: speed, specifically running speed.

2. Recall the maximum speeds of both animals.

   - Cheetah: Capable of speeds up to 70-75 mph.

   - Lion: Capable of speeds up to 50 mph.

3. Compare the speeds: 70-75 mph for cheetah vs. 50 mph for lion. Clearly, the cheetah has a higher top speed.

4. Therefore, a lion is not faster than a cheetah; the cheetah is faster.

Final answer should be No, since the lion is not faster.

The question is: "Is a lion faster than a cheetah?" If I say No, that means the lion is not faster, which is correct.

I could say: No, a lion is not faster than a cheetah; cheetahs are faster.

But for the final answer, it should be just Yes or No based on the question.

The instruction says: "final answer (Yes or No)", so I need to output that.

Also, I need to show step-by-step reasoning.

So, in my response, I'll write the reasoning and then the final answer.

Reasoning:

- Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, with a top speed of about 70-75 mph.

- Lions have a top speed of about 50 mph.

- Since 50 mph is less than 70-75 mph, lions are slower than cheetahs.

- Therefore, a lion is not faster than a cheetah.

Final answer: No.

I think that's straightforward.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the question**: The question is asking whether a lion is faster than a cheetah in terms of running speed. This requires comparing the top speeds of both animals.

2. **Recall biological facts**: 
   - Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are widely recognized as the fastest land animals. They are built for speed with adaptations like lightweight bodies, long legs, flexible spines, and specialized muscles that allow for rapid acceleration.
   - Lions (Panthera leo) are powerful predators but are not designed for extreme speed. They rely more on strength, teamwork, and short bursts of speed for hunting.

3. **Compare top speeds**:
   - According to scientific records and wildlife experts, the top speed of a cheetah is approximately **70–75 miles per hour (mph)** or **112–120 kilometers per hour (km/h)**. This speed is achieved in short bursts of about 20–30 seconds, covering distances up to 500 meters.
   - Lions, on the other hand, have a top speed of about **50 mph (80 km/h)**. This is also a short burst speed, but it is significantly lower than that of a cheetah.

4. **Analyze the comparison**:
   - The cheetah's top speed (70–75 mph) is greater than the lion's top speed (50 mph).
   - Therefore, a lion cannot outrun a cheetah in a straight sprint. Cheetahs hold the title of the fastest land animal, while lions are slower in comparison.

5. **Conclusion based on evidence**: Since the lion's maximum speed is lower than the cheetah's, a lion is not faster than a cheetah.

### Final Answer
No
