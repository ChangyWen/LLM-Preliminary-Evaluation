*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is 97233, OR located west of 98580, WA?" I need to determine if the ZIP code 97233 in Oregon is west of the ZIP code 98580 in Washington.

ZIP codes are postal codes used in the United States, and they can give a general idea of location, but they don't directly provide longitude and latitude. To compare their positions, I need to find the approximate coordinates of these ZIP codes.

I should look up the geographic coordinates for 97233 and 98580. Since I'm an AI, I can access or recall data about ZIP codes. I know that ZIP codes correspond to specific areas, and I can think about the general regions.

Let me recall: Oregon is west of Washington? No, that doesn't make sense. Washington is north of Oregon, but in terms of east-west, both states are on the west coast. Washington is to the north, and Oregon is to the south, but since the coast runs north-south, "west" might depend on the specific locations within the states.

ZIP code 97233: I believe this is in Portland, Oregon. Portland is in the northwest part of Oregon, near the border with Washington.

ZIP code 98580: This should be in Washington. Let me think, 985xx is for southwestern Washington, like around Olympia or something. 98580 might be specific; I need to be precise.

Since I can't look it up live, I should use general knowledge or infer based on states and regions.

I remember that longitude measures east-west position. Lower longitude numbers are further west in the United States because the US is in the western hemisphere, so as you go west, longitude decreases (becomes more negative if using the decimal system, but often we use absolute values with direction).

Longitude is measured from the Prime Meridian. For the US, longitudes are west, so they are negative in decimal degrees. But for comparison, we can think in terms of numerical value: a smaller numerical value (more negative) means further west.

For example, the west coast has longitudes around -120 to -125 degrees, while the east coast is around -70 to -80.

So, to compare two points, the one with the smaller longitude value (more negative) is further west.

I need the approximate longitude of ZIP code 97233 and ZIP code 98580.

First, let's find out where these ZIP codes are.

ZIP code 97233: I think this is for a specific area in Portland, Oregon. Portland is around 45.5 degrees north latitude and -122.6 degrees longitude or something like that. I should be more precise.

I can think of the cities associated with these ZIP codes.

97233: A quick mental search—I believe this is for the Portland area, specifically maybe Northeast Portland or something. But generally, Portland, OR.

98580: I think this is for Centralia, Washington. I recall that 98580 is Centralia, WA. Centralia is in Lewis County, Washington, southwest of Olympia.

Now, let's get their coordinates.

Portland, OR: Approximately 45.5152° N, 122.6784° W. So longitude about -122.68 degrees.

Centralia, WA: I think it's around 46.7165° N, 122.9546° W. Let me confirm that.

Centralia is roughly at 46.7° N, 123.0° W or something. I should use consistent sources.

Since I don't have real-time access, I'll use my training data.

Generally, Portland is at about -122.7° longitude.

Centralia, WA: Since it's west of the Cascade Mountains, but let's see the longitude.

I remember that Seattle is around -122.3° longitude, but Centralia is south of Seattle.

Seattle is approximately 47.6062° N, 122.3321° W.

Centralia is further south and a bit west? Centralia is in southwest Washington.

Coordinates for Centralia: Latitude 46.7165° N, Longitude -122.9546° W. Yes, that seems right.

Now for Portland: Let's take downtown Portland as a reference. 45.5152° N, -122.6784° W.

But ZIP code 97233 might not be exactly downtown; it could be a specific neighborhood. However, for this purpose, it should be close enough.

Similarly, 98580 is for Centralia, so we can use that.

Now, compare longitudes:

Portland, OR (97233): approx -122.68° W

Centralia, WA (98580): approx -122.95° W

Longitude is measured in degrees west, so numerically, -122.95 is smaller (more negative) than -122.68.

Since longitude decreases as you go west, -122.95 is west of -122.68.

Let's think: -122.95 means 122.95 degrees west, which is further west than 122.68 degrees west. So yes, numerically smaller longitude means further west.

For example, San Francisco is around -122.4, which is east of Portland's -122.7? No.

San Francisco longitude is approximately -122.4194, which is about 122.42 W.

Portland is about 122.68 W, which is numerically larger than 122.42, but since it's west, 122.68 W is further west than 122.42 W? No.

I think I'm confusing myself.

Let me clarify:

The more westward a location, the higher the numerical value of its longitude in degrees west, but when expressed as a negative number, it becomes more negative.

Standard is: Longitude from -180 to 180, with negative for west.

So, for two points, the one with the smaller (more negative) longitude is further west.

For instance:

- New York: about -74° longitude

- Chicago: about -87°

- Denver: about -105°

- San Francisco: about -122.4°

- Portland, OR: about -122.7°

- Seattle, WA: about -122.3° (Seattle is at -122.3, which is less negative than Portland, so east of Portland? That doesn't seem right.)

Seattle and Portland: Seattle is north of Portland, but in terms of east-west, I think Seattle is slightly east of Portland.

Let me think geographically.

Portland is on the Columbia River, and Seattle is further north. The Pacific coast runs north-south, but inland, the longitude might differ.

I recall: Portland, OR longitude: approximately 122.68° W

Seattle, WA longitude: approximately 122.33° W

122.33° W vs 122.68° W; 122.33 is less than 122.68, so 122.33° W is east of 122.68° W because as you move east, longitude decreases numerically when measured in degrees west.

Longitude in degrees west: higher number means further west.

But when using decimal degrees with negative sign, a more negative number means further west.

-122.33 vs -122.68: -122.33 is greater than -122.68 because -122.33 is to the right on the number line.

Numerically: -122.33 and -122.68, -122.33 is larger (less negative) than -122.68.

Therefore, -122.33 is east of -122.68.

Yes, that makes sense: Seattle is at about -122.33, Portland at -122.68, so Portland has a smaller longitude value, meaning it is further west.

For example, from Seattle to Portland, you go south and slightly west, so Portland is west of Seattle.

Similarly, Centralia, WA is at about -122.95°.

-122.95 is smaller (more negative) than -122.68, so Centralia is west of Portland.

Let's see:

Centralia, WA longitude: approximately -122.95° W

Portland, OR longitude: approximately -122.68° W

-122.95 < -122.68, so Centralia has a smaller longitude, meaning it is further west.

Therefore, 98580, WA (Centralia) is west of 97233, OR (Portland).

But the question is: Is 97233, OR west of 98580, WA?

If Centralia is west of Portland, then Portland is east of Centralia, so 97233 is not west of 98580; it's east.

Let's confirm the coordinates.

First, ZIP code 97233: I said it's Portland, but let's make sure it's not on the east side or something.

97233 is a ZIP code for Portland, specifically, I think it's in the Hazelwood area or something, but generally, it's within Portland, so longitude should be around -122.6 to -122.7.

Similarly, 98580 is Centralia, WA.

Centralia, WA coordinates: Let's use a reliable source in my mind.

Centralia, Lewis County, WA: Latitude 46.716° N, Longitude -122.954° W.

Portland, OR: For simplicity, let's take the city center at 45.520° N, -122.681° W. But ZIP 97233 might be slightly different; however, it should be close.

I can think that Portland's longitude ranges from about -122.5 to -122.8, but the average is around -122.6 to -122.7.

Centralia is at -122.954, which is about 122.95 W.

Portland is at 122.68 W approximately.

So 122.95 W vs 122.68 W: 122.95 is further west than 122.68, so Centralia is west of Portland.

Therefore, 98580, WA is west of 97233, OR.

So, is 97233, OR west of 98580, WA? No, because 98580 is further west.

But let's double-check the ZIP codes.

Perhaps I should look up the actual locations.

Since I can't, I can reason based on geography.

Centralia, WA is in southwest Washington, about halfway between Portland and Seattle, but closer to Olympia.

From Portland, to go to Centralia, you head north on I-5. Centralia is north of Portland, but also slightly west because the Columbia River bends.

Portland is at approximately 122.68° W, Centralia at 122.95° W.

The difference: 122.95 - 122.68 = 0.27 degrees, which is about 18-20 miles west, since one degree of longitude is about 53 miles at that latitude.

Latitude around 46°N, cosine of 46 is about 0.6947, so one degree longitude is about 69.17 * 0.6947 ≈ 48 miles? Let's calculate.

Earth circumference approx 24,901 miles at equator, so per degree longitude: 24,901 / 360 ≈ 69.17 miles at equator.

At latitude θ, it's 69.17 * cos(θ) miles per degree.

For Portland, θ≈45.5°, cos(45.5) ≈ 0.7009, so per degree: 69.17 * 0.7009 ≈ 48.5 miles.

For Centralia, θ≈46.7°, cos(46.7)≈0.685, 69.17*0.685≈47.4 miles.

Average about 48 miles per degree.

Longitude difference: | -122.954 - (-122.681) | = | -122.954 + 122.681 | = | -0.273 | = 0.273 degrees.

So distance west-east: about 0.273 * 48 ≈ 13.1 miles.

Since Centralia has a more negative longitude, it is west of Portland by about 13 miles.

Therefore, 98580, WA is west of 97233, OR.

Hence, 97233, OR is not west of 98580, WA; it is east of it.

So the answer should be no.

But the question is: "Is 97233, OR located west of 98580, WA?"

Based on this, no.

But let's make sure about the ZIP codes.

ZIP code 97233: I think it's for Portland, Oregon, specifically the area around NE 122nd Ave or something. But longitude should be similar.

Perhaps I can find the centroid or something.

Another way: Washington state is north of Oregon, but southwest Washington, like Centralia, is at a similar latitude to Portland but slightly north, and west.

Portland latitude about 45.5°N, Centralia about 46.7°N, so north, but longitude more west.

To be thorough, let's consider the states.

Oregon is south of Washington, but the westernmost point of Oregon is west of parts of Washington? No, the coast is straight, but inland.

For example, the westernmost point in Washington is Cape Alava, around -124.7° longitude, while Oregon's westernmost is around -124.5° or something, but we're talking about specific points.

For these ZIP codes, 97233 is in Portland, which is inland, and 98580 is in Centralia, also inland but closer to the coast relatively.

Centralia is not on the coast; it's about 50 miles from the Pacific, similar to Portland.

Portland is about 70 miles inland, Centralia about 60 miles, but longitude-wise, Centralia is west.

I think I'm overcomplicating.

Based on coordinates:

- 97233, OR: Longitude approximately -122.68° (I'll use -122.7° for simplicity)

- 98580, WA: Longitude approximately -122.95°

-122.95 < -122.7, so 98580 has smaller longitude, thus west.

Therefore, 97233 is not west of 98580.

But the question is about 97233 being west of 98580, which it is not.

So answer should be No.

But let's confirm the ZIP code for Centralia. Is 98580 indeed Centralia?

I believe so. ZIP code 98580 is assigned to Centralia, WA.

Similarly, 97233 is for Portland, OR.

Perhaps I can think of the cities: Centralia, WA and Portland, OR.

Anyone familiar with the area knows that Centralia is north and west of Portland.

For example, driving from Portland to Seattle on I-5, you pass through Centralia, which is about 80 miles north, but since the road goes slightly northwest, you gain some longitude west.

From Portland, heading north, you go to Longview, then Centralia.

Longview, WA is at about -122.94° longitude, similar to Centralia.

Portland is at -122.68°.

So yes.

Therefore, 98580, WA is west of 97233, OR.

Hence, 97233, OR is east of 98580, WA.

So, it is not located west of it.

Therefore, the answer is no.

But the question is to say Yes or No.

Also, show step-by-step reasoning.

So, in conclusion:

Step 1: Identify the locations of the ZIP codes.

- ZIP code 97233 is in Portland, Oregon.

- ZIP code 98580 is in Centralia, Washington.

Step 2: Find approximate longitudes.

- Portland, OR longitude: approximately -122.68° W

- Centralia, WA longitude: approximately -122.95° W

Step 3: Compare longitudes.

- Since -122.95 is smaller (more negative) than -122.68, Centralia has a more western longitude.

- Therefore, Centralia, WA (98580) is located west of Portland, OR (97233).

Step 4: Answer the question.

- The question is whether 97233, OR is west of 98580, WA.

- Since 98580 is west of 97233, 97233 is not west of 98580; it is east.

- So, the answer is No.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine if ZIP code 97233 in Oregon (OR) is located west of ZIP code 98580 in Washington (WA), we need to compare their geographic longitudes. Longitude measures east-west position, with more negative values (in decimal degrees) indicating a location further west in the Western Hemisphere.

1. **Identify the locations associated with the ZIP codes:**
   - ZIP code 97233 corresponds to Portland, Oregon. Portland is a major city in northwestern Oregon.
   - ZIP code 98580 corresponds to Centralia, Washington. Centralia is a city in Lewis County, southwestern Washington.

2. **Find the approximate longitudes for these locations:**
   - Portland, OR (ZIP 97233): The approximate longitude is -122.68° W. This is based on the geographic center of Portland, as ZIP code 97233 covers part of the city (e.g., the Hazelwood area), and the longitude is consistent across the Portland metropolitan area.
   - Centralia, WA (ZIP 98580): The approximate longitude is -122.95° W. This is based on the coordinates for Centralia, which is located along the I-5 corridor in Washington.

3. **Compare the longitudes:**
   - Longitude values are negative in the Western Hemisphere, and a smaller (more negative) longitude indicates a position further west.
   - Centralia, WA longitude: -122.95° W
   - Portland, OR longitude: -122.68° W
   - Since -122.95 is smaller (more negative) than -122.68, Centralia (98580) is west of Portland (97233).

4. **Geographic verification:**
   - Centralia, WA, is approximately 13 miles west of Portland, OR, based on the longitude difference of about 0.27 degrees (calculated as | -122.95 - (-122.68) | = 0.27 degrees). At this latitude (around 46°N), one degree of longitude is approximately 48 miles, so 0.27 degrees ≈ 13 miles.
   - Therefore, Portland (97233) is east of Centralia (98580), not west.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since Centralia (98580, WA) is west of Portland (97233, OR), Portland cannot be west of Centralia. The answer to the question "Is 97233, OR located west of 98580, WA?" is no.

**Final Answer: No**
