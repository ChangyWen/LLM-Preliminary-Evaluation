We are given two locations:
  1. St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV
  2. Pine Flat Dam, CA

We need to determine if St. Mary’s is located east of Pine Flat Dam.

Step 1: Identify the approximate coordinates of both places.

For St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church in Virginia City, NV:
  - Virginia City, NV is located in the western part of Nevada.
  - Coordinates: Approximately 39°18'36.0"N 119°38'56.4"W (or 39.3100° N, 119.6490° W)

For Pine Flat Dam in California:
  - Pine Flat Dam is located in Fresno County, California.
  - Coordinates: Approximately 36°49'57.0"N 119°19'22.0"W (or 36.8325° N, 119.3228° W)

Step 2: Compare the longitudes.
  - Longitude for St. Mary’s: 119.6490° W
  - Longitude for Pine Flat Dam: 119.3228° W

Note: In the context of longitude in the western hemisphere (negative when using decimal degrees in a west convention, but we are comparing the degrees west as positive numbers in the context of being west of the prime meridian). However, we can compare the absolute values as they are both in the west.

But note: When we say a point A is east of point B, it means that point A has a longitude that is less west (or more east) than point B. So we compare the numerical values (with negative convention if using signed degrees, but here both are west so they are negative in the standard coordinate system). Alternatively, we can compare the absolute values but in reverse: a higher absolute value of west longitude means more west.

Alternatively, we can think in terms of the standard signed system where west longitudes are negative. So:

  St. Mary’s: -119.6490° (longitude)
  Pine Flat Dam: -119.3228° (longitude)

Now, in the decimal degree system (negative for west), a point is east of another if it has a higher longitude value (less negative). So:

  -119.3228° is greater than -119.6490°.

Therefore, Pine Flat Dam is at a longitude that is more east (less west) than St. Mary’s.

Alternatively, we can compare the absolute west longitudes:

  St. Mary’s: 119.6490° W
  Pine Flat Dam: 119.3228° W

A place with a smaller number of degrees west (like 119.3228° W) is more east than a place with a larger number (119.6490° W). So Pine Flat Dam is more east than St. Mary’s.

Thus, St. Mary’s is west of Pine Flat Dam? Or we are asking: is St. Mary’s east of Pine Flat Dam?

The question: Is St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV located east of Pine Flat Dam, CA?

Since St. Mary’s has a longitude of 119.6490° W and Pine Flat Dam has 119.3228° W, that means St. Mary’s is more west (by about 0.3262 degrees). Therefore, St. Mary’s is west of Pine Flat Dam.

So the answer is: No, St. Mary’s is not east of Pine Flat Dam.

Final Answer: No

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations and their coordinates**:
   - **St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church** is located in Virginia City, Nevada (NV).
     - Approximate coordinates: 39°18'36.0"N, 119°38'56.4"W (or 39.3100°N, 119.6490°W).
   - **Pine Flat Dam** is located near Fresno, California (CA).
     - Approximate coordinates: 36°49'57.0"N, 119°19'22.0"W (or 36.8325°N, 119.3228°W).

2. **Compare longitudes**:
   - Longitude measures east-west position. Lower longitude values (less west/more east) are farther east.
   - St. Mary’s longitude: **119.6490°W**.
   - Pine Flat Dam longitude: **119.3228°W**.
   - Since both are in the Western Hemisphere, we compare the numerical values directly: 119.6490 is greater than 119.3228, meaning St. Mary’s is **farther west**.

3. **Determine relative position**:
   - Pine Flat Dam (119.3228°W) has a smaller longitude than St. Mary’s (119.6490°W), so Pine Flat Dam is east of St. Mary’s.
   - Therefore, St. Mary’s is **west of Pine Flat Dam**, not east.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - St. Mary’s in the Mountains is located west of Pine Flat Dam, so it is not east of it.

**Final Answer: No**
