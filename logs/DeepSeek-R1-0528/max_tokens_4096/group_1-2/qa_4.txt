*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan located south of WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I should clarify the locations. I know that Manhattan and Williamsburg are both in New York City, but Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which might be a mistake. Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Similarly, Hillman Houses is a public housing development, and I think it's in Manhattan.

Let me confirm that. Hillman Houses is located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Specifically, it's near the East River, around Grand Street and Columbia Street.

Williamsburg is across the East River in Brooklyn. So, if we're talking about directions, from Manhattan, Williamsburg is to the east, across the river.

The question is about whether Hillman Houses is south of Williamsburg, Manhattan. But Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan; it's in Brooklyn. The question might have a typo or be misstated. Perhaps it means "Williamsburg, Brooklyn" or something. But it says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which is incorrect.

Maybe it's referring to a place called Williamsburg within Manhattan, but I don't think that exists. Williamsburg is specifically a Brooklyn neighborhood.

Perhaps it's a confusion with the Williamsburg Bridge, which connects Manhattan and Brooklyn, but the bridge isn't a neighborhood.

I should look at the context. The question is: "HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan" and "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan." Since Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan, this might be an error.

But to answer the question as stated, I need to assume that "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" is meant to be Williamsburg in Brooklyn, or perhaps it's a mistake.

Another thought: There might be a small area or something named Williamsburg in Manhattan, but I doubt it. I think it's safe to say that Williamsburg is in Brooklyn.

So, let's proceed with that understanding. Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, and Williamsburg is in Brooklyn.

Now, to determine if Hillman Houses is south of Williamsburg.

First, I need the geographical coordinates or relative positions.

Hillman Houses is on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Specifically, it's bounded by Grand Street to the north, Columbia Street to the east, and so on. The address is around 100 Grand Street, New York, NY.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is directly east across the East River. The main part of Williamsburg is around Bedford Avenue, Metropolitan Avenue, etc.

In terms of latitude and longitude, Manhattan is oriented roughly north-south, with the southern tip at Battery Park.

The Lower East Side is in downtown Manhattan, which is the southern part of the island.

Williamsburg in Brooklyn is also in the northern part of Brooklyn, just across from the Lower East Side.

I should compare the latitudes.

Let me find approximate latitudes.

The latitude of the Lower East Side, say around Grand Street, is about 40.716°N.

Williamsburg, say around Bedford and Metropolitan, is about 40.714°N or similar.

I need to be precise.

I can think in terms of the street grid.

In Manhattan, streets increase in number as you go north. Grand Street is in the 100s, so it's quite far south. For example, 1st Street is near Houston, and streets go up to 220th or so.

Grand Street is around 4000 block or something? No, street numbers.

In Manhattan, street numbers start from 1 at the south, but below Houston, it's different.

South of 14th Street, it's mostly named streets, but numbered streets start from 1st Street up.

Grand Street is between Houston and Delancey, which is south of 1st Street? Let's clarify.

Houston Street is the dividing line; south of Houston is considered downtown, including the Lower East Side.

Grand Street is south of Houston Street. Houston is around 100-200 block, but it's a bit messy.

Generally, the Lower East Side is from the East River to the Bowery, and from Canal Street up to 14th Street, but Grand Street is between Delancey and Division, roughly.

To simplify, let's use latitude.

I recall that the Williamsburg Bridge connects Delancey Street in Manhattan to Williamsburg in Brooklyn.

Delancey Street is at about 40.718°N latitude.

Hillman Houses is near Grand Street, which is just south of Delancey Street. Grand Street is about 40.715°N.

Williamsburg, on the Brooklyn side, the area near the bridge, say Marcy Avenue, is about 40.712°N.

Let me confirm with actual data.

From memory: The latitude of the Williamsburg Bridge Manhattan side is approximately 40.714°N, and Brooklyn side around 40.712°N.

But Hillman Houses is at 40.714°N, 73.981°W (approximately).

Williamsburg, say the Bedford Avenue L train stop, is at 40.714°N, 73.957°W.

That's interesting; both at 40.714°N? That can't be right because the bridge might be at different points.

Let me think differently.

The East River separates Manhattan and Brooklyn. Williamsburg is directly east of the Lower East Side.

In terms of north-south, they are roughly at the same latitude, but Williamsburg might be slightly south or north?

From maps, I know that the Williamsburg Bridge runs almost east-west, so the Manhattan side and Brooklyn side are at similar latitudes.

Specifically, Delancey Street in Manhattan is at the same level as parts of Williamsburg.

But Hillman Houses is south of Delancey Street. Hillman Houses is on Grand Street and Columbia Street.

Grand Street is one block south of Delancey Street in that area.

In Brooklyn, Williamsburg extends south and north, but the core is aligned with Delancey.

For example, the Williamsburg Bridge lands in Brooklyn around South 5th Street or something.

The Manhattan approach is at Delancey and Clinton Streets, approximately 40.718°N.

The Brooklyn side is at Broadway and Havemeyer Street, around 40.712°N.

I think the Brooklyn side is slightly south.

Let's look up approximate coordinates.

Since this is reasoning, I can use general knowledge.

Hillman Houses: Located at 100 Grand Street, New York, NY 10002. Latitude: 40.7143° N, Longitude: 73.9817° W.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn: Let's take a central point, say Bedford Ave and N 7th St. Latitude: 40.7142° N, Longitude: 73.9570° W.

Oh, so both are approximately 40.714°N. So they are at the same latitude, meaning neither is north or south of the other; they are directly east-west.

But the question is about being south, so if they are at the same latitude, Hillman Houses is not south of Williamsburg; it's directly west.

But let's confirm with another point.

Perhaps Williamsburg extends further south. For example, the southern part of Williamsburg might be below Broadway.

Take South Williamsburg, near the Williamsburg Bridge base, which is around 40.710°N.

But generally, the neighborhood is considered to be at the same level.

In terms of boroughs, Manhattan south of Williamsburg? Williamsburg is in Brooklyn.

The question is: "south of WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" but Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan.

Perhaps the user meant "Williamsburg, Brooklyn" but wrote "Manhattan" by mistake.

Maybe there is a Williamsburg in Manhattan, but I don't think so.

Another idea: Perhaps "Williamsburg" refers to the Williamsburg section of the Lower East Side or something, but that's not standard.

I think it's a error, and it should be Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Assuming that, and given the coordinates, Hillman Houses at 40.7143°N and Williamsburg central at 40.7142°N, they are essentially at the same latitude.

Therefore, Hillman Houses is not south of Williamsburg; it is directly to the west.

If we consider the southern part of Williamsburg, it might be slightly south, but Hillman Houses is also in the south of Manhattan.

For example, the southern boundary of Williamsburg is around Division Avenue or something, but it's not clearly defined.

Generally, for practical purposes, they are east-west aligned.

But let's see the exact location.

Hillman Houses is on the Lower East Side, which is south of East Village and north of Chinatown, but Williamsburg is across the river.

The latitude of the southern tip of Manhattan is about 40.70°N, and northern tip around 40.87°N.

Grand Street at 40.714°N is relatively south.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn, from north to south: North Williamsburg around N 15th St at 40.722°N, South Williamsburg around S 5th St at 40.710°N.

So Williamsburg spans from about 40.710°N to 40.722°N.

Hillman Houses at 40.7143°N is within that range, so it's neither consistently north nor south; it depends on the part.

But the core area is around 40.714°N.

Since Hillman Houses is at 40.7143°N and Williamsburg has points north and south, but on average, it's at the same latitude.

For the purpose of this question, since both are at approximately 40.714°N, Hillman Houses is not south of Williamsburg.

In fact, Williamsburg has areas to the south, like near the Williamsburg Bridge Brooklyn anchorage at 40.712°N, which is south of 40.714°N, so there are parts of Williamsburg south of Hillman Houses.

But the question is whether Hillman Houses is south of Williamsburg, meaning south of the Williamsburg area.

Since Williamsburg extends south to about 40.710°N, which is south of 40.714°N, that means Hillman Houses is north of some parts of Williamsburg.

Similarly, it is south of the northern parts.

But the question likely refers to the general location.

Given that the Williamsburg Bridge connects directly, and the Manhattan side is at Delancey (40.718°N), which is north of Hillman Houses at Grand (40.714°N), and the Brooklyn side is at 40.712°N, which is south of Delancey but north or same as Grand.

Let's calculate the difference.

Delancey Street at Essex Street: approximately 40.718°N

Grand Street at Essex: approximately 40.714°N, so about 0.004 degrees south, which is roughly 0.44 km south, since 1 degree is about 111 km, so 0.004 * 111,000 m = 444 meters south.

Williamsburg Bridge Brooklyn side: let's say at Driggs Avenue and Broadway, 40.712°N.

So Hillman Houses at 40.714°N is north of the Brooklyn side at 40.712°N by 0.002 degrees, about 222 meters north.

But Williamsburg as a neighborhood includes areas north and south.

The center of Williamsburg is often considered around Bedford and N 7th at 40.714°N, same as Hillman Houses.

Therefore, Hillman Houses is not south of Williamsburg; it is approximately at the same latitude or slightly north in some comparisons.

To be precise, since the southern part of Williamsburg is south of Hillman Houses, Hillman Houses is not south of Williamsburg; it is north of the southern parts.

The question is: "located south of WILLIAMSBURG"

So, is Hillman Houses south of Williamsburg? Based on the center, no. Based on the northern boundary, no. Based on the southern boundary, yes, but that's not how it's typically asked.

I think for such questions, we consider the general reference point.

Moreover, the question has "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" which is invalid.

Perhaps the user meant "Williamsburg Bridge" or something, but it says "Williamsburg."

Another possibility: There is a housing project or something called Williamsburg in Manhattan? I don't think so.

I recall that in Manhattan, there is no Williamsburg neighborhood. Williamsburg is exclusively Brooklyn.

Therefore, I think the question has a mistake, but I need to answer based on geography.

Final decision: Hillman Houses and Williamsburg are at approximately the same latitude, so Hillman Houses is not south of Williamsburg.

In fact, Williamsburg is directly east, so it is not south.

South would imply a lower latitude.

Since latitudes are the same, it is not south.

Therefore, the answer should be no.

But let's confirm with a map.

If I look at a map of NYC, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is directly across from the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The Lower East Side includes areas from about Canal Street up to 14th Street, with Grand Street being around the middle.

Williamsburg has streets like Grand Street in Brooklyn as well, but that's not the point.

The Grand Street in Brooklyn is in Williamsburg, at about 40.714°N, same as in Manhattan.

But Hillman Houses is on the Manhattan side.

So, no significant north-south offset.

Therefore, Hillman Houses is not south of Williamsburg.

The answer should be no.

But the question says "south of WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" which might imply that Williamsburg is considered in Manhattan, but since it's not, it's invalid.

For the sake of answering, I'll assume it's Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Hillman Houses is a public housing development located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, specifically at approximately 40.7143°N latitude.

2. Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The core of Williamsburg is at approximately 40.7142°N latitude.

3. Since both locations share nearly the same latitude, Hillman Houses is not south of Williamsburg; they are roughly aligned east-west.

4. Parts of Williamsburg extend south to about 40.710°N, which is south of Hillman Houses, meaning Williamsburg has areas south of Hillman Houses, but that does not make Hillman Houses south of Williamsburg.

5. Therefore, Hillman Houses is not located south of Williamsburg.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the Locations:**
   - **Hillman Houses**: This is a public housing development located in Manhattan, specifically on the Lower East Side. Its approximate address is 100 Grand Street, New York, NY 10002. Geographically, it is situated at a latitude of approximately 40.7143°N.
   - **Williamsburg**: Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The core area of Williamsburg (e.g., near Bedford Avenue and N 7th Street) has a latitude of approximately 40.7142°N. The neighborhood spans from about 40.710°N (southern parts, near the Williamsburg Bridge) to 40.722°N (northern parts).

2. **Address the "Manhattan" Reference in the Question:**
   - The question mentions "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," but Williamsburg is not located in Manhattan; it is in Brooklyn. This appears to be an error or misstatement. For accurate geographical comparison, I will assume the intent is to refer to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, as that is the standard and only recognized location for Williamsburg.

3. **Compare Latitudes for North-South Positioning:**
   - In geography, "south" means a lower latitude (smaller numerical value when in the Northern Hemisphere).
   - Hillman Houses latitude: ~40.7143°N.
   - Williamsburg core latitude: ~40.7142°N (virtually identical).
   - Since the latitudes are nearly the same (difference is negligible, about 0.0001°), Hillman Houses is not south of the core of Williamsburg; they are roughly aligned east-west (with Hillman Houses directly west of Williamsburg across the East River).
   - Considering the full extent of Williamsburg:
     - The southern boundary of Williamsburg (e.g., near Division Avenue or the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn) is at ~40.710°N, which is south of Hillman Houses (40.7143°N).
     - The northern boundary is at ~40.722°N, north of Hillman Houses.
   - However, for a location to be considered "south of" another, it must have a consistently lower latitude than the entire area or a defined reference point. Here:
     - Hillman Houses is at a higher latitude than the southern parts of Williamsburg (so it is north of those areas).
     - It is at the same latitude as the core and lower than the northern parts (so it is south of those areas).
     - On average, the latitudes are too similar to claim Hillman Houses is definitively south of Williamsburg.

4. **Consider the Broader Context:**
   - The Williamsburg Bridge connects Manhattan's Delancey Street area (latitude ~40.718°N, north of Hillman Houses) to Williamsburg in Brooklyn. Hillman Houses is near Grand Street (~40.714°N), which is south of Delancey Street. The Brooklyn side of the bridge is at ~40.712°N, slightly south of Hillman Houses, but this is a specific point, not the entire neighborhood.
   - Geographically, Hillman Houses and Williamsburg are separated by the East River, with no significant north-south displacement; they are primarily offset east-west.

5. **Conclusion on Positioning:**
   - Based on latitude comparison and neighborhood boundaries, Hillman Houses is not south of Williamsburg. They share nearly identical latitudes in their core areas, and any minor variation does not support a "south" relationship. Instead, Hillman Houses is directly west of Williamsburg.

**Final Answer: No**
