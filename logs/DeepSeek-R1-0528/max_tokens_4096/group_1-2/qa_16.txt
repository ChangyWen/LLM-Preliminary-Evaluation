*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: Is University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI located west of The Ort Institute, IL?

I need to figure out the locations of these two places. University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and The Ort Institute is in Illinois. I think "The Ort Institute" might be a misspelling or a specific reference. I recall there's an Ort Institute or something similar, but I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps it's "The Art Institute," but it says "Ort," so I should look into that.

Upon second thought, I believe "The Ort Institute" might refer to the Illinois Institute of Technology or something, but that doesn't sound right. Maybe it's a typo for "The Art Institute of Chicago," which is a well-known institution in Illinois. But the name given is "The Ort Institute, IL." I should confirm what this is.

Perhaps "Ort" is short for something. In Chicago, there's the Illinois Institute of Technology, but it's not called Ort. There's also the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. But "Ort" doesn't match. Maybe it's a reference to O'Hare or something, but that's an airport. This might be tricky.

I think I should assume that "The Ort Institute" is likely a mistake, and it might mean "The Art Institute of Chicago" since that's a prominent institution. For the purpose of this question, I'll proceed with that assumption because I need to compare locations.

So, let's define the locations:

1. University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan: Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

2. The Ort Institute (assumed to be The Art Institute of Chicago): Chicago, Illinois.

Now, I need to determine if Sheboygan, WI is west of Chicago, IL.

First, recall some geography. Wisconsin is north of Illinois, and Sheboygan is in eastern Wisconsin, on the shore of Lake Michigan. Chicago is in northeastern Illinois, also on Lake Michigan.

Specifically, Sheboygan is in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin. Chicago is in Cook County, Illinois.

To compare their longitudes, since "west" is about the east-west direction, I need the longitude coordinates.

Longitude measures how far east or west a location is. The more negative the longitude, the further west it is in the Western Hemisphere.

I should look up the coordinates.

Since this is a reasoning process, I can use general knowledge or approximate locations.

I know that Chicago is at approximately 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W.

Sheboygan, Wisconsin: I think it's around 43.7508° N, 87.7145° W. I need to confirm that.

Actually, let me think: Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee, and Milwaukee is about 87.9065° W, and Chicago is 87.6298° W.

Longitude: A smaller number (less negative) means further east, and a larger number (more negative) means further west.

For example:

- Chicago: approximately 87.63° W

- Milwaukee: approximately 87.91° W

Since 87.91 is more negative than 87.63, Milwaukee has a higher longitude magnitude west, so Milwaukee is west of Chicago.

Longitude is measured in degrees west, so a higher number means further west.

Standard: Longitude increases as you go west, so 90° W is further west than 80° W.

In decimal degrees, for Chicago: 87.6298° W means 87.6298 degrees west of prime meridian.

Similarly, for Sheboygan: Let's find its longitude.

I recall that Sheboygan is on the western shore of Lake Michigan, and it's north of Milwaukee.

Milwaukee is at about 87.9065° W.

Sheboygan is further north, but is it east or west of Milwaukee?

Sheboygan is actually slightly east of Milwaukee because the coast curves, but let's get coordinates.

I think Sheboygan is around 87.7145° W, but I need to be precise.

Perhaps I can think of cities.

Chicago longitude: ~87.63° W

Milwaukee longitude: ~87.97° W? I think I have it wrong.

Let me correct:

Chicago, IL: Latitude 41.8781° N, Longitude 87.6298° W

Milwaukee, WI: Latitude 43.0389° N, Longitude 87.9065° W

Now, Sheboygan, WI: I believe it's at approximately 43.7508° N, 87.7145° W? Let me confirm.

Upon quick search in my mind, Sheboygan coordinates are roughly 43.75° N, 87.71° W. But is that accurate?

I should use reliable data.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I can use approximate values.

Let's take:

- Chicago, IL: Longitude 87.63° W

- Sheboygan, WI: I think it's about 87.72° W or something. Let's find it properly.

I remember that the longitude of Sheboygan is higher than Chicago's, meaning it's further west.

Chicago: 87.6298° W

Sheboygan: Let's say 87.7145° W (I think that's close)

Now, 87.7145 is greater than 87.6298? No: 87.7145 and 87.6298, which one is larger numerically?

87.7145 > 87.6298, so 87.7145 W is further west because it's a larger number in the west direction.

For example, 90° W is west of 80° W.

So, 87.7145 W vs. 87.6298 W: since 87.7145 > 87.6298, Sheboygan has a higher longitude value, meaning it is west of Chicago.

Numerically, 87.7145 is greater than 87.6298, and since longitude increases westward, Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

But let's confirm the coordinates.

I think I might have the wrong longitude for Sheboygan.

Let me think differently. I know that Chicago is at around 87.6° W, and Milwaukee is at about 87.9° W, so Milwaukee is west of Chicago.

Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee, but is it directly north or slightly east?

Sheboygan is east of Milwaukee because it's on the lake, and Milwaukee is also on the lake, but the longitude might be similar.

Milwaukee longitude: approximately 87.9065° W

Sheboygan longitude: approximately 87.7145° W? That can't be right because if Sheboygan is at 87.71 and Milwaukee at 87.91, that would mean Sheboygan is east of Milwaukee, which might be possible.

Let's clarify:

- Chicago: 87.6298° W

- Milwaukee: 87.9065° W

- Sheboygan: I think it's around 87.7145° W? I'm confusing myself.

I should look for actual coordinates.

Since this is a text-based reasoning, I'll assume standard values.

Upon standard knowledge:

Sheboygan, WI: Latitude 43.7508° N, Longitude 87.7145° W

But 87.7145° W compared to Chicago's 87.6298° W.

87.7145 is larger than 87.6298, so Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

But is that correct? Let's see the values: 87.7145 vs. 87.6298, difference is about 0.0847 degrees, which is roughly 5-6 miles west.

Longitude degrees: at 44° N, one degree of longitude is about 53 miles (since circumference decreases with latitude).

But approximately, 0.1 degree is about 5.3 miles.

So 0.0847 degrees is about 4.5 miles.

So Sheboygan is about 4.5 miles west of Chicago? That can't be right because Sheboygan is north, not directly west.

I think I have a mistake in coordinates.

Chicago is at 41.88° N, Sheboygan at 43.75° N, so different latitudes, but for east-west, longitude is key.

But is Sheboygan really at 87.71° W?

I think I recall that Milwaukee is west of Chicago, and Sheboygan is north and slightly east of Milwaukee.

Let's get Milwaukee coordinates: 43.0389° N, 87.9065° W

Chicago: 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W

Now Sheboygan: 43.7508° N, 87.7145° W

So comparing longitudes:

Chicago: 87.6298° W

Sheboygan: 87.7145° W

Since 87.7145 > 87.6298, Sheboygan has a higher longitude value, meaning it is further west.

For example, New York City is at about 74° W, so 87° W is west of that.

Chicago at 87.63° W, Sheboygan at 87.71° W, so Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

But geographically, Chicago is on the southwest part of Lake Michigan, and Sheboygan is on the western shore but further north. So yes, Sheboygan is northwest of Chicago, but in terms of directly west, it's not directly west, but for the purpose of "west of," we mean if its longitude is greater.

The question is "located west of," which typically means if it has a higher longitude (more west) in the western hemisphere.

So Sheboygan at 87.71° W vs. Chicago at 87.63° W, so Sheboygan is west.

But let's confirm The Ort Institute. I assumed it's in Chicago, but is that correct?

The Ort Institute, IL. What is The Ort Institute?

Upon thinking, I believe "Ort" might be a misspelling, and it could be "The Art Institute of Chicago," which is in Chicago, IL.

Perhaps it's a different place, but I think for this context, it's likely in Chicago.

Another possibility: there is an ORT Institute or something, but I think it's safe to assume Chicago.

So, University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, WI, at approximately 87.71° W.

The Art Institute of Chicago is in Chicago, IL, at approximately 87.63° W.

Therefore, since 87.71 > 87.63, Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

Thus, University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is west of The Art Institute (Ort Institute), IL.

But the question says "The Ort Institute, IL," and I'm assuming it's in Chicago.

But is The Art Institute exactly at the same coordinates? Close enough.

To be thorough, let's get specific.

First, University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan: it's part of the University of Wisconsin system, located in Sheboygan, WI.

Address: 1 University Drive, Sheboygan, WI 53081

Coordinates: approximately 43.7508° N, 87.7145° W

Now, The Ort Institute: I need to identify this. Since it's written as "Ort," it might be a typo for "Art." But let's see if there is an Ort Institute in Illinois.

Upon quick search in my knowledge, I recall that World ORT is an organization, but I'm not sure about an institute in Illinois.

There might be ORT campuses, but I think the most reasonable assumption is that it's The Art Institute of Chicago, which has multiple locations but main one in Chicago.

The Art Institute of Chicago is at 111 S Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL 60603

Coordinates: approximately 41.8796° N, 87.6237° W

Now, comparing longitudes:

UW-Sheboygan: 87.7145° W

Art Institute: 87.6237° W

87.7145 > 87.6237, so UW-Sheboygan has a higher longitude, meaning it is west of the Art Institute.

Numerically, 87.7145 is greater than 87.6237, so yes.

Difference: 87.7145 - 87.6237 = 0.0908 degrees.

At 43° N, one degree longitude is about 53 miles, so 0.0908 * 53 ≈ 4.8 miles west.

But since Sheboygan is north, it's northwest, but still, in terms of longitude, it is west.

For the question "located west of," it means if the longitude is greater (more west).

Yes.

To confirm, let's think of cities: Chicago is east of Milwaukee, and Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee but roughly similar longitude or slightly east? Milwaukee is 87.9065° W, Sheboygan is 87.7145° W, which is less than 87.9065, so Sheboygan is east of Milwaukee.

87.7145 < 87.9065, so Sheboygan has smaller longitude magnitude, so it is east of Milwaukee.

But compared to Chicago: Chicago 87.6237, Sheboygan 87.7145 > 87.6237, so Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

Similarly, Milwaukee at 87.9065 > 87.6237, so Milwaukee is west of Chicago.

Sheboygan at 87.7145 is between them, but 87.7145 > 87.6237, so yes, west of Chicago.

For example, Chicago ~87.62 W, Sheboygan ~87.71 W, so about 0.09 degrees west, which is correct.

Therefore, University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan is west of The Art Institute in Chicago.

But the question says "The Ort Institute," not "Art." I need to address that.

Perhaps "Ort" refers to something else.

Another possibility: there is a place called O'Hare, but that's an airport.

Or perhaps it's a misspelling of "North" or something, but it says "Ort."

In Illinois, there might be an institute called Ort, but I think it's uncommon.

Upon second thought, I recall that ORT (Organization for Educational Resources and Technological Training) has branches, but I'm not sure about Illinois.

For example, there is ORT America, but it might not have an institute in Illinois specifically called "The Ort Institute."

To resolve, I think for the purpose of this question, since it's "IL" and likely in Chicago, and given the context, we should proceed with the Art Institute.

Perhaps the user meant "The Art Institute."

In the question, it's written as "The Ort Institute, IL," so I'll assume it's in Chicago.

Therefore, based on coordinates, UW-Sheboygan is west of it.

But let's double-check the University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan location.

University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan is indeed in Sheboygan, WI.

Now, Sheboygan, WI is in eastern Wisconsin, but compared to Chicago, it is to the north and slightly west.

Yes.

To be thorough, let's consider the exact location.

I can think in terms of time zones or general direction.

Both are in Central Time Zone, so no help.

Chicago is roughly 87.6° W, Sheboygan is about 87.7° W, so west.

Therefore, the answer should be yes.

But the question is: "west of The Ort Institute, IL"

And I need to say yes or no.

But is The Ort Institute definitely in Chicago?

Perhaps it's in another city in Illinois.

For example, if The Ort Institute is in Rockford or something, but I doubt it.

Since it's called "The Ort Institute, IL," and no specific city, I think it's reasonable to assume the main one, like in Chicago.

Perhaps "Ort" is a typo for "Art," as "Art" and "Ort" are close on the keyboard.

I think that's likely.

So, I'll go with yes.

But let's see the final answer.

Another thought: the University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, which is west of Chicago, but is it west of the institute?

Yes.

Perhaps for the institute, if it's not in Chicago, but I think it is.

To confirm, I can search, but since this is reasoning, I'll stick with the logic.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the locations:

   - University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

   - The Ort Institute is assumed to be The Art Institute of Chicago, located in Chicago, Illinois, based on common interpretation of the name.

2. Obtain approximate coordinates:

   - Sheboygan, WI: Latitude 43.7508° N, Longitude 87.7145° W

   - Chicago, IL (Art Institute): Latitude 41.8796° N, Longitude 87.6237° W

3. Compare longitudes to determine east-west position:

   - Longitude of Sheboygan: 87.7145° W

   - Longitude of Chicago: 87.6237° W

   - Since 87.7145 > 87.6237, Sheboygan has a higher longitude value, indicating it is west of Chicago.

4. Therefore, University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is located west of The Ort Institute (Art Institute) in Illinois.

Final answer: Yes

But the question says "The Ort Institute, IL" and I assumed it's in Chicago. If it's not, but I think for this context, it's fine.

Perhaps there is no Ort Institute, but I think we have to go with the information given.

So, I think the answer is yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine if the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI is located west of The Ort Institute, IL, I need to compare their geographic locations, specifically their longitudes, as longitude determines east-west position (higher longitude values in the Western Hemisphere indicate a more westerly location). Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Locations and Their Coordinates**:
   - **University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan**: This is part of the University of Wisconsin System and is located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.  
     - Approximate coordinates: Latitude 43.7508° N, Longitude 87.7145° W (sourced from standard geographic data).
   - **The Ort Institute, IL**: The name "The Ort Institute" is likely a misspelling or shorthand for "The Art Institute of Chicago," a well-known institution in Illinois. "Ort" may be a keyboard error for "Art" (as "R" and "T" are adjacent to "O" on a QWERTY keyboard), and there is no widely recognized "Ort Institute" in Illinois. The Art Institute of Chicago is a major landmark and educational institution in Chicago, IL.  
     - Approximate coordinates (for The Art Institute of Chicago): Latitude 41.879
