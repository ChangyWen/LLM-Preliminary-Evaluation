*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Clackamas County, Oregon, is north of Yamhill County, Oregon. I should start by recalling where these counties are located in Oregon.

I know that Oregon is divided into multiple counties. Clackamas County is in the northwestern part of Oregon, and it includes parts of the Portland metropolitan area. Yamhill County is also in northwestern Oregon, west of Portland.

To compare their positions, I should look at a map or recall their relative locations. Since I don't have a map in front of me, I'll rely on my geographical knowledge.

Let me think about major cities or landmarks. Portland is in Multnomah County, which is north of Clackamas County. Clackamas County is southeast of Multnomah County. For example, Oregon City is in Clackamas County, which is south of Portland.

Yamhill County is to the southwest of Portland. Cities like McMinnville and Newberg are in Yamhill County. Newberg is close to the Willamette River, and it's west of Portland.

Now, to figure out if Clackamas is north of Yamhill, I need to compare their latitudes.

I recall that Yamhill County is generally west of the Willamette River, while Clackamas County is east of Yamhill County but also extends south.

Perhaps I should look at the county borders. I remember that Washington County is between Multnomah and Yamhill to the west, and Clackamas is to the east.

Let me list the counties from north to south in that region.

Starting from the north: Columbia County is north of Multnomah. But Multnomah County (Portland) is one of the northernmost.

South of Multnomah is Clackamas County to the southeast, and Washington County to the west.

Yamhill County is south of Washington County. So Yamhill is southwest of Portland.

Clackamas County is directly south of Multnomah and east of Washington County.

Therefore, since Yamhill is south of Washington, and Washington is west of Clackamas, Yamhill might be south of Clackamas?

Let me think about latitude.

I know that the city of Portland is at about 45.5 degrees north latitude.

Oregon City, in Clackamas County, is slightly south of Portland, maybe around 45.3 degrees or so.

Newberg, in Yamhill County, is west of Portland but at a similar latitude. I think Newberg is about 45.3 degrees as well, so similar latitude.

But I need the county positions, not just cities.

Counties can be large, so I should consider their geographic centers or overall position.

Clackamas County extends from the Columbia River in the north to the Cascade Mountains in the east and south. Its northern border is with Multnomah County, so it shares a border with Portland.

Yamhill County's northern border is with Washington County, and Washington County's northern border is with Multnomah County.

So, directly, Yamhill County does not border Multnomah County; Washington County is in between.

Similarly, Clackamas County borders Multnomah to the north and west, but to the west, it borders Washington County, not Yamhill.

Clackamas County borders: north is Multnomah, west is Washington County, south is Marion County, east is Hood River and Wasco, etc.

Yamhill County borders: north is Washington County, east is Marion County (I think), south is Polk County, west is Tillamook County.

Yamhill County does not directly border Clackamas County. Between them is Washington County to the north and Marion County to the south? Let's see.

Washington County is directly west of Clackamas County. Then south of Washington County is Yamhill County.

But Yamhill County is also east of the Coast Range, and it's in the Willamette Valley.

To compare north-south, I should look at the latitude of their northernmost points or something.

I recall that the northern border of Yamhill County is roughly at the same latitude as the southern part of Washington County, and Washington County is south of Multnomah.

Multnomah County's southern border is with Clackamas and Washington.

The city of Tigard, in Washington County, is south of Portland, and it's about 45.4 degrees latitude.

McMinnville in Yamhill County is about 45.2 degrees latitude.

Oregon City in Clackamas is about 45.3 degrees.

But let's use more precise references.

I think I can think about the Willamette River. The Willamette flows north through the valley. Portland is at the confluence with the Columbia.

Clackamas County is on the east side of the Willamette in its southern part, but it includes areas east.

Generally, for the purpose of this question, the population centers.

But to be accurate, let's consider the county seats or geographic centers.

Clackamas County seat is Oregon City.

Yamhill County seat is McMinnville.

Now, latitude of Oregon City: approximately 45.357° N.

Latitude of McMinnville: approximately 45.210° N.

45.357 is greater than 45.210, so Oregon City is north of McMinnville.

Therefore, Clackamas County's seat is north of Yamhill County's seat.

But is the county itself north? Since counties can be irregular, but generally, if the seat is north and the county extends similarly, it might be indicative.

Moreover, looking at the borders.

The northern border of Clackamas County is with Multnomah County, which is at about 45.5° N or so.

The northern border of Yamhill County is with Washington County. Washington County's northern border is with Multnomah at about 45.6° N, but its southern border with Yamhill is lower.

Specifically, the latitude of the Yamhill-Washington county line.

I think the northern border of Yamhill County is around 45.3° N to 45.4° N, depending.

For example, the city of North Plains in Washington County is at about 45.6° N, but that's far north. The southern part of Washington County, where it meets Yamhill, is around 45.2° N to 45.3° N.

Similarly, Clackamas County's southern border is much further south, but its northern part is higher.

The northernmost point of Clackamas County is near the Columbia River, at about 45.6° N, same as Portland.

The northernmost point of Yamhill County is less, maybe 45.3° N or so.

Yamhill County doesn't go as far north; it's set further south.

For instance, the city of Wilsonville is in Clackamas County, at about 45.3° N, and it's on the border with Marion County.

But Wilsonville is south, yet still around 45.3° N.

McMinnville is at 45.21° N, which is south of that.

Also, Newberg in Yamhill County is at about 45.3° N, similar to Oregon City.

Newberg latitude is approximately 45.300° N, and Oregon City is 45.357° N, so Oregon City is slightly north.

But let's confirm the latitudes.

Upon second thought, I can use general knowledge.

I remember that Yamhill County is considered to be southwest of Portland, while Clackamas is southeast and south.

But in terms of north-south, both are south of Portland, but Clackamas is directly south, and Yamhill is more southwest.

Since Portland is north, and both are south, but which one is further south?

From the latitudes:

- Portland: 45.515° N

- Oregon City (Clackamas): 45.357° N

- Newberg (Yamhill): 45.300° N

- McMinnville (Yamhill): 45.210° N

So Oregon City at 45.357° N, Newberg at 45.300° N, so Oregon City is north of Newberg by about 0.057 degrees, which is roughly 4 miles north, since one degree is about 69 miles.

So yes, Clackamas County seat is north of Yamhill County's Newberg, but McMinnville is further south.

However, since Newberg is in Yamhill County, and it's at 45.300° N, while Oregon City is at 45.357° N, so Clackamas has a point north of Yamhill's northern point? Not necessarily.

What is the northernmost point of Yamhill County?

Yamhill County's northern border is with Washington County. The latitude there varies, but for example, the area near Gaston or something. Gaston is in Washington County at about 45.435° N, and the border might be similar.

I think the highest latitude in Yamhill is around 45.4° N or so, but let's see.

To simplify, I think it's generally accepted that Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County.

But let me think about driving directions. If I go from Portland to Salem, I go south on I-5 through Clackamas County (Wilsonville area) and then into Marion County. Yamhill County is to the west; I would take a different route to go to McMinnville.

But for north-south, the Willamette Valley runs north-south, so counties to the east or west might share similar latitudes.

Clackamas County is on the east side, Yamhill on the west side, but both are in the valley.

The latitude range: Clackamas County spans from about 45.15° N at its southern tip to 45.6° N at the northern tip near the Columbia.

Yamhill County spans from about 45.0° N to 45.4° N, roughly.

Specifically, the northern border of Yamhill is approximately 45.4° N, and southern around 45.0° N.

For Clackamas, northern border 45.6° N, southern border with Marion is around 44.9° N or something, but that's way south.

But for comparison, the northern part of Clackamas is at 45.6° N, while northern part of Yamhill is at 45.4° N, so Clackamas extends further north.

Similarly, the southern part of Clackamas is further south than Yamhill, but since we're asking if Clackamas is north of Yamhill, it depends on the overall position.

Typically, when we say one county is north of another, we mean that the majority or the key part is north, or that it lies to the north.

But in this case, since Clackamas has areas north of Yamhill and areas south, but the northern point of Clackamas is north of Yamhill's northern point, and similarly, the southern point might be different.

To be precise, let's see if any part of Clackamas is north of Yamhill.

Since the northern border of Clackamas is at higher latitude than the northern border of Yamhill.

Northern border of Clackamas: shared with Multnomah, at about 45.52° N or so (since Columbia River is 45.6, but county line).

The latitude of the Clackamas-Multnomah border is approximately 45.45° N to 45.50° N, I think.

For example, the city of Milwaukie is in Clackamas at 45.44° N, and it's on the border.

Portland is 45.52, so border around there.

Yamhill County's northern border with Washington County. Washington County's southern border is at lower latitude.

For instance, the city of Sherwood, Washington County, is at 45.356° N, and Yamhill starts south of that, so Yamhill northern border around 45.35° N or less.

Newberg is at 45.30° N, and it's in Yamhill, so the border might be around 45.35° N.

Whereas in Clackamas, Oregon City at 45.36° N, and areas north like Gladstone at 45.38° N, which is part of Clackamas.

Gladstone, OR is at 45.380° N, in Clackamas County.

Newberg, OR is at 45.300° N, in Yamhill County.

45.380 > 45.300, so Gladstone is north of Newberg.

Therefore, there are parts of Clackamas County that are north of parts of Yamhill County.

In fact, since Gladstone is at 45.38° N and Newberg at 45.30° N, Gladstone is about 0.08 degrees north, which is roughly 5.5 miles north.

Moreover, the northernmost point of Clackamas is further north, around 45.5° N near the Columbia, while Yamhill's northernmost is probably no higher than 45.35° N.

Therefore, Clackamas County is located north of Yamhill County.

But is it entirely north? No, because Clackamas extends south to Mount Hood area, which is around 45.3° N but also east, and Yamhill has southern parts at 45.0° N, but since Clackamas has areas at 44.9° N, it might have points south of Yamhill.

For example, the city of Estacada in Clackamas is at about 45.28° N, which is south of McMinnville at 45.21? McMinnville is 45.21, Estacada is 45.28, so 45.28 > 45.21, so Estacada is north of McMinnville.

45.28 N vs 45.21 N, 45.28 is larger latitude, so further north.

Latitude increases as you go north.

45.28° N is north of 45.21° N.

Similarly, the southern tip of Clackamas is near Mount Hood, around 45.0° N or less, but that's mountainous.

Yamhill's southern tip is around 45.0° N or 44.9° N.

But on average, Clackamas is positioned more to the north and east.

Specifically for this question, since there are parts of Clackamas north of Yamhill, and the county seat is north, I think it's fair to say Clackamas is north of Yamhill.

I can look for a map in my mind: if I imagine Oregon, Portland at top, then south is Clackamas, and to the west is Washington, then south of Washington is Yamhill. So Yamhill is south of Washington, and since Washington is west of Clackamas, but at the same latitude band, Yamhill is shifted south compared to Clackamas.

For instance, the latitude of downtown Portland is 45.52° N.

Tualatin in Washington County is about 45.37° N.

Newberg in Yamhill is 45.30° N.

Oregon City in Clackamas is 45.36° N.

So Oregon City (Clackamas) at 45.36° N vs Newberg (Yamhill) at 45.30° N, so Clackamas is north.

Similarly, Wilsonville in Clackamas is at 45.30° N, same as Newberg, but Wilsonville is on the southern border.

Wilsonville latitude is 45.304° N, Newberg 45.300° N, almost same.

But McMinnville at 45.210° N is south of that.

Since Yamhill has McMinnville at lower latitude, and Clackamas has Oregon City at higher, overall Clackamas is north.

Moreover, the northern areas of Clackamas are at higher latitude than any part of Yamhill.

Therefore, Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County.

But to confirm, I think I recall that Yamhill County is south of Washington County, and Clackamas is adjacent to Washington but to the east, so at similar latitudes, but since Yamhill is south, it should be south of Clackamas.

In terms of county adjacency: Clackamas does not border Yamhill; they are separated by Washington and Marion counties.

Washington County is directly west of Clackamas, and Yamhill is south of Washington.

Therefore, Yamhill is south and west of Clackamas.

So, since it's south, that means Clackamas is north of Yamhill.

Yes, that makes sense.

For example, to go from Clackamas to Yamhill, you go west and south through Washington County.

Therefore, Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County.

So the answer should be Yes.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine if Clackamas County, OR, is located north of Yamhill County, OR, I will use geographical knowledge, including county locations, borders, and latitude comparisons. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understand Oregon's County Geography**:
   - Oregon is divided into 36 counties, with Clackamas and Yamhill both located in the northwestern part of the state, within the Willamette Valley region.
   - Clackamas County is part of the Portland metropolitan area and lies to the southeast of Portland (which is in Multnomah County).
   - Yamhill County is also near Portland but is positioned to the southwest, known for its wine country and agricultural areas.

2. **Identify Relative Positions**:
   - Clackamas County borders:
     - **North**: Multnomah County (which contains Portland).
     - **West**: Washington County.
     - **South**: Marion County.
     - **East**: Hood River and Wasco Counties.
   - Yamhill County borders:
     - **North**: Washington County.
     - **East**: Marion County (and a small portion of Clackamas County does not directly border Yamhill; they are separated by Washington and Marion Counties).
     - **South**: Polk County.
     - **West**: Tillamook County.
   - Since Yamhill County is directly south of Washington County, and Washington County is directly west of Clackamas County, Yamhill County is generally southwest of Clackamas County.

3. **Compare Latitudes**:
   - Latitude increases as you move north, so higher latitude values indicate a more northern location.
   - Key reference points:
     - **Clackamas County Seat**: Oregon City (latitude approximately 45.357° N).
     - **Yamhill County Seat**: McMinnville (latitude approximately 45.210° N).
     - Other cities:
       - Gladstone (in Clackamas County): Approximately 45.380° N.
       - Newberg (in Yamhill County): Approximately 45.300° N.
   - Comparison:
     - Oregon City (Clackamas) at 45.357° N is north of McMinnville (Yamhill) at 45.210° N (difference of about 0.147 degrees, or roughly 10 miles north).
     - Gladstone (Clackamas) at 45.380° N is north of Newberg (Yamhill) at 45.300° N (difference of about 0.080 degrees, or roughly 5.5 miles north).
   - Overall, the northernmost point of Clackamas County (near the
