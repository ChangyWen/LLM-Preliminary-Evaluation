*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Clackamas County, Oregon, is located north of Yamhill County, Oregon. Both are in Oregon, so I should recall their relative positions within the state.

I know that Oregon is divided into counties, and I have a general sense of their geography. Clackamas County is in the northwestern part of Oregon, and it includes areas near Portland. Yamhill County is also in the northwest, but I think it's west of Clackamas.

Let me think about the major cities. Portland is in Multnomah County, which is north of Clackamas County. Clackamas County is south of Multnomah County and east of Washington County. Yamhill County is southwest of Washington County.

Yamhill County has cities like McMinnville and Newberg. Clackamas County has cities like Oregon City, Clackamas, and parts of the Portland metro area.

Now, to compare their latitudes. I need to figure out which one is farther north.

I recall that the Willamette River runs through both counties. The Willamette Valley is a key feature, and counties are arranged along it.

Let me list the counties from north to south in the Willamette Valley area.

Starting from the north: Columbia County is north of Multnomah. But Multnomah is the northernmost with Portland. South of Multnomah is Clackamas County. Then, south of Clackamas is Marion County, with Salem. West of Marion is Yamhill County.

Yamhill County is west of the Willamette River, while Clackamas is east of it in some parts, but Clackamas County extends south and east.

Perhaps I should think about the county seats or specific points.

The county seat of Yamhill County is McMinnville. The county seat of Clackamas County is Oregon City.

Now, I need the latitude of Oregon City and McMinnville.

Oregon City, OR: I believe it's around 45.36°N latitude.

McMinnville, OR: I think it's around 45.21°N latitude.

I should look this up, but since I'm reasoning, I'll use general knowledge.

I remember that Portland is at about 45.52°N, Oregon City is just south of Portland, so it should be slightly less, maybe 45.35°N or so.

McMinnville is farther south; it's in the valley, southwest of Portland.

Newberg is in Yamhill County, and it's at about 45.30°N, I think. But Oregon City is at 45.36°N, which is north of Newberg.

Let me confirm: Oregon City latitude is approximately 45.357°N.

McMinnville latitude is approximately 45.210°N.

Since 45.357 is greater than 45.210, Oregon City is north of McMinnville.

But Oregon City is in Clackamas County, and McMinnville is in Yamhill County. So if Oregon City is north of McMinnville, that suggests Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County.

But counties are large, so I need to consider the entire county boundaries.

Clackamas County extends from the Columbia River south to Mount Hood, so it has a wide range of latitudes.

Similarly, Yamhill County has areas from the Willamette River west to the coast range.

But for the purpose of this question, "located north of" probably means that the northernmost point of Clackamas is north of the northernmost point of Yamhill, or perhaps on average.

Typically, when we say one county is north of another, we mean that the majority or the county seat is north, but it's best to compare extreme points.

Let me think about the northern boundaries.

First, Clackamas County: its northern border is with Multnomah County. Multnomah County is north of Clackamas, and Clackamas shares a border with Multnomah.

Yamhill County is west of Washington County, and Washington County is west of Multnomah and north of Yamhill.

The counties around Portland: Multnomah is central, with Portland. To the west is Washington County (Hillsboro, Beaverton), and to the south is Clackamas County (Oregon City, Clackamas).

Yamhill County is directly south of Washington County and west of Clackamas County? No.

Let's get a map in my mind.

Oregon counties:

- North: Columbia County

- Then Multnomah County (Portland)

South of Multnomah: Clackamas County to the east and southeast, but directly south is Clackamas.

West of Multnomah: Washington County.

South of Washington County: Yamhill County and a bit of Clackamas? No.

Washington County is south of Columbia and west of Multnomah.

South of Washington County is Yamhill County.

East of Washington County is Multnomah and Clackamas? Multnomah is to the east, but Clackamas is southeast.

The border: Washington County shares a border with Multnomah to the east and with Clackamas to the southeast? I think Washington County shares a border with Clackamas County.

Yes, Washington County and Clackamas County share a border. For example, the area around Lake Oswego is in Clackamas, and it's adjacent to Washington County.

Yamhill County is directly south of Washington County and does not share a border with Clackamas County. Between Yamhill and Clackamas is Marion County.

Let's clarify.

The county directly south of Clackamas is Marion County (Salem).

Yamhill County is west of Marion County and south of Washington County.

So, relative positions:

- Washington County is north of Yamhill County.

- Clackamas County is east of Washington County and northeast of Yamhill County.

Specifically, Clackamas County is north of Marion County, and Yamhill County is west of Marion County.

Since Marion County is south of Clackamas, and Yamhill is west but at a similar latitude.

For latitude comparison:

The northern part of Clackamas County is at the same latitude as the northern part of Washington County, which is north of Yamhill.

Yamhill County's northern border is with Washington County, so its northernmost point is at the latitude of Washington County's southern border.

Washington County's southern border is with Yamhill County, so the latitude there is around 45.2°N or something.

Clackamas County's northern border is with Multnomah County, which is at about 45.5°N.

Multnomah County's southern border with Clackamas is around 45.3°N or so, but Oregon City is at 45.36°N, which is the northern part of Clackamas.

The northernmost point of Clackamas County is near the Columbia River, which is at about 45.6°N, I think, since it borders the river in some areas.

Clackamas County does not border the Columbia River; that's Multnomah and further east. Clackamas is inland.

Multnomah County borders the Columbia River. Clackamas County is south of Multnomah, so its northern border is south of the Columbia River.

The latitude at the northern border of Clackamas County: since it borders Multnomah, and Portland is around 45.52°N, the border might be around 45.4°N or so.

But let's find a reference point.

The city of Milwaukie is in Clackamas County, at about 45.44°N.

Further north, near the border, it might be similar.

Now, Yamhill County's northern border is with Washington County. Washington County's northern border is with Columbia County at about 45.7°N, but the southern border with Yamhill is lower.

The city of Hillsboro in Washington County is at about 45.52°N, similar to Portland.

But Yamhill County starts south of that.

For example, the city of North Plains in Washington County is at 45.60°N, but that's north.

The border between Washington and Yamhill: Yamhill County begins around latitude 45.3°N or so.

McMinnville is at 45.21°N, and it's central Yamhill. Newberg, which is in the northeast of Yamhill County, is at about 45.30°N.

Newberg, OR latitude: 45.300°N.

Now, Clackamas County: Oregon City is at 45.357°N.

45.357 is higher than 45.300, so Oregon City is north of Newberg.

Moreover, the northernmost part of Clackamas County is near Happy Valley or Damascus, which is around 45.44°N, like Milwaukie.

Milwaukie is at 45.44°N, which is north of Newberg's 45.30°N.

Yamhill County's northernmost point is near the Washington County border. Since Washington County goes down to about 45.3°N, Yamhill starts there, so its northernmost is about 45.3°N.

For example, the area around Gaston in Washington County is near the border; Gaston is at 45.44°N, but that's in Washington County. The border might be irregular.

But generally, Yamhill County's northern border is around 45.3°N to 45.4°N in some parts, but let's say approximately 45.3°N.

Whereas Clackamas County's northern border is around 45.4°N to 45.5°N.

Specifically, the latitude at the northern edge of Clackamas is higher than the northern edge of Yamhill.

Moreover, the entire Clackamas County is positioned north of most of Yamhill County.

Yamhill County extends from about 45.2°N to 45.4°N, I think.

Clackamas County extends from about 45.2°N in the south to 45.5°N in the north.

The southern part of Clackamas is near Molalla, which is around 45.15°N, and it goes up to 45.5°N.

Yamhill County: southern part near Lafayette or something, around 45.2°N to northern part 45.3°N.

McMinnville is 45.21°N, and Newberg is 45.30°N. Yamhillville or other points might be similar.

The highest point in Yamhill might be around 45.35°N near the Washington border, but I think it's lower.

Since Clackamas County's northern areas are above 45.4°N and Yamhill's northern areas are below 45.4°N, except perhaps at the very corner.

But Newberg is 45.30°N, and the border might be similar.

In contrast, cities like Gladstone in Clackamas are at 45.38°N, north of that.

Therefore, it's clear that Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County.

But is there any part of Yamhill that is north of Clackamas? I don't think so, because Clackamas is to the east and north.

Since Yamhill is west of Marion and Clackamas is east of Marion, but Marion is south of Clackamas, so Yamhill is southwest of Clackamas.

Therefore, Yamhill County is both west and south of Clackamas County.

In terms of cardinal directions, Clackamas is northeast of Yamhill.

So, yes, Clackamas is north of Yamhill.

To be thorough, let's consider the county centroids or something.

But I think for practical purposes, the answer should be yes.

Final answer: Yes.

The question is: "Is Clackamas County, OR located north of Yamhill County, OR?"

Based on my reasoning, yes.

But let me confirm with a reliable source in my mind.

I recall that when driving from Portland to the coast, you go through Washington County and then Yamhill County, which is west and a bit south.

To go to Salem, you go south through Clackamas to Marion.

So, Clackamas is directly south of Portland, while Yamhill is southwest.

Therefore, Clackamas has a higher latitude.

Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine if Clackamas County, Oregon, is located north of Yamhill County, Oregon, I will compare their geographic positions using known reference points, such as county seats, major cities, and latitude coordinates. Since counties can have irregular shapes, I will consider key locations to establish a general north-south relationship.

1. **Identify County Seats and Key Cities**:
   - Clackamas County seat: Oregon City.
   - Yamhill County seat: McMinnville.
   - Other relevant cities:
     - Clackamas County: Includes cities like Milwaukie (northern part) and Oregon City.
     - Yamhill County: Includes cities like Newberg (northeastern part) and McMinnville.

2. **Compare Latitude Coordinates**:
   - Latitude is a key indicator for north-south positioning. Higher latitude values indicate a more northern location.
   - Oregon City, Clackamas County: Approximately 45.357°N.
   - McMinnville, Yamhill County: Approximately 45.210°N.
   - Since 45.357°N (Oregon City) is greater than 45.210°N (McMinnville), Oregon City is north of McMinnville.
   - Additional points:
     - Milwaukie, Clackamas County: Approximately 45.44°N (northern area).
     - Newberg, Yamhill County: Approximately 45.30°N (northeastern area, closest to Clackamas County).
     - Comparing these, Milwaukie (45.44°N) is north of Newberg (45.30°N).

3. **County Boundary Analysis**:
   - Clackamas County's northern border is with Multnomah County (which contains Portland). The northernmost point of Clackamas County is around 45.5°N (e.g., near the Columbia River area, though Clackamas does not directly border the river; it is inland).
   - Yamhill County's northern border is with Washington County. The northernmost point of Yamhill County is approximately 45.3°N–45.4°N (e.g., near the Washington County border, such as in the Newberg area).
   - Clackamas County's northern boundary (around 45.4°N–45.5°N) is at a higher latitude than Yamhill County's northern boundary (around 45.3°N–45.4°N), indicating that Clackamas County is generally positioned north of Yamhill County.

4. **Relative Position in Oregon**:
   - Clackamas County is located in the northwestern part of Oregon, directly south of Multnomah County (Portland) and east of Washington County.
   - Yamhill County is also in the northwestern region, but it is southwest of Washington County and west of Marion County (which contains Salem).
   - Clackamas County does not share a direct border with Yamhill County; Marion County lies between them to the south. This positioning shows that Clackamas County is to the northeast of Yamhill County.
   - Driving directions or regional descriptions often place Clackamas County as part of the Portland metro area (north), while Yamhill County is considered part of the Willamette Valley's western section, which is generally south and west of Clackamas.

5. **Conclusion from Data**:
   - The latitude of key areas in Clackamas County is consistently higher than those in Yamhill County.
   - No part of Yamhill County extends north of Clackamas County; Yamhill is positioned both west and south of Clackamas.
   - Therefore, Clackamas County is located north of Yamhill County.

**Final Answer: Yes**
