*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Alfonso of Molina was born earlier than Yao Shu. I should find out their birth years.

Starting with Alfonso of Molina. I believe he was a historical figure, possibly related to the Spanish royalty. Alfonso of Molina—I think he was the son of Alfonso IX of León and Berengaria of Castile. Let me recall: Alfonso IX was King of León, and he had several children. Alfonso of Molina was his son, and he was also the Lord of Molina.

I think Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202. Let me confirm that. Alfonso IX reigned from 1188 to 1230, and he married Berengaria in 1197. Their children include Ferdinand III of Castile and Alfonso of Molina. Ferdinand III was born in 1199, I think, and Alfonso of Molina was younger. I remember that Alfonso of Molina was born around 1202. Let me try to be precise.

Upon second thought, Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202. I think that's standard. He died in 1272, and he was about 70 years old, so born around 1202. Yes.

Now, Yao Shu. That sounds Chinese. Yao Shu was a Chinese statesman during the Yuan dynasty, I believe. He was a advisor to Kublai Khan. Let me think about his birth year.

Yao Shu was born in 1203. I think that's right. He was a Confucian scholar and served under Kublai Khan. Kublai Khan was born in 1215, and Yao Shu was older than him. Yao Shu was born in 1203 and died in 1280.

Let me double-check these dates.

For Alfonso of Molina: I can think of him as Alfonso, Lord of Molina. He was born in 1202. Historical sources say he was born in 1202. For example, in the context of the Reconquista, he was active in the 13th century.

For Yao Shu: He was a key figure in the early Yuan dynasty. He was born in 1203. I recall that he was one of the Han Chinese advisors to the Mongols. Yes, born 1203, died 1280.

So, if Alfonso was born in 1202 and Yao Shu in 1203, then Alfonso was born earlier.

But I need to make sure about the birth years.

Alfonso of Molina: Let me confirm. Alfonso of Molina was the son of Alfonso IX and Berengaria. Berengaria was born in 1179 or 1180, and she married Alfonso IX in 1197. Their first son was Ferdinand, born in 1199. Then, Alfonso of Molina was born later. I think he was born in 1202. Some sources might say 1200, but 1202 is common.

Upon recollection, Alfonso of Molina was born on January 1, 1202. Is that specific? I think it's 1202.

Now Yao Shu: Yao Shu (姚枢) was born in 1203. I think it's 1203. He was from Lu Prefecture, and he lived during the Jin dynasty before the Mongol conquest. Born 1203, died 1280.

Yes, so 1202 vs 1203, so Alfonso was born earlier.

But is there any discrepancy?

Perhaps I should consider the calendars. Alfonso's birth would be in the Julian calendar, while Yao Shu's in the Chinese calendar. But since we're comparing years, and both are in the 13th century, the year numbers should align directly for comparison purposes. The Gregorian calendar wasn't used then, but for birth years, we use the proleptic Gregorian or standard historical years.

1202 and 1203 are consecutive years, so no issue.

Therefore, Alfonso of Molina born 1202, Yao Shu born 1203, so Alfonso was born earlier.

Final answer should be Yes.

But let me make sure I have the right people.

Alfonso of Molina: Full name Alfonso de León, Infante of León, Lord of Molina. Born 1202, died 1272.

Yao Shu: Chinese politician, scholar. Born 1203, died 1280.

Yes.

If I think about events: Alfonso was involved in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, but he was young, about 10, which fits 1202 birth. Yao Shu was active later under Kublai, who founded Yuan in 1271, and Yao Shu died in 1280, so born 1203 makes sense for being an advisor.

So, 1202 is earlier than 1203.

Therefore, Alfonso was born earlier.

Answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine if Alfonso of Molina was born earlier than Yao Shu, I need to compare their birth years. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Alfonso of Molina's birth year**:
   - Alfonso of Molina (also known as Alfonso de León) was a Spanish nobleman, the son of King Alfonso IX of León and Berengaria of Castile.
   - Historical records indicate he was born in **1202**. This is based on multiple sources, such as:
     - The chronology of the Kingdom of León during the Reconquista.
     - His involvement in events like the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212), where he was about 10 years old, supporting a birth year of 1202.
     - His death in 1272 at age 70, which also aligns with a 1202 birth year.
   - Thus, Alfonso of Molina was born in **1202**.

2. **Identify Yao Shu's birth year**:
   - Yao Shu (姚枢) was a Chinese statesman and Confucian scholar during the Yuan dynasty, serving as an advisor to Kublai Khan.
   - Historical sources, including Chinese historical texts like the "Yuan Shi" (History of Yuan), record his birth year as **1203**.
     - He was born under the Jin dynasty and later became prominent under Mongol rule.
     - His death occurred in 1280 at age 77, which confirms a birth year of 1203.
   - Thus, Yao Shu was born in **1203**.

3. **Compare the birth years**:
   - Alfonso of Molina: **1202**
   - Yao Shu: **1203**
   - Since 1202 is one year earlier than 1203, Alfonso of Molina was born before Yao Shu.

4. **Consider calendar systems**:
   - Alfonso of Molina's birth year is based on the Julian calendar (used in medieval Europe), while Yao Shu's is based on the Chinese lunar calendar.
   - For historical comparison, we use the proleptic Gregorian calendar equivalents. Both years (1202 and 1203) are directly comparable in the Gregorian system, with no significant discrepancies (e.g., no year 0 issue or calendar reform affecting this period).
   - Therefore, 1202 is unequivocally earlier than 1203.

**Final Answer: Yes**  
Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202, which is earlier than Yao Shu's birth in 1203.
