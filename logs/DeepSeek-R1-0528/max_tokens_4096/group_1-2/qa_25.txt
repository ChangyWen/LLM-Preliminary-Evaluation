*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
I need to determine if 32796, FL is north of 32751, FL. Both are ZIP codes in Florida. I should figure out the locations of these ZIP codes and compare their latitudes.

First, I know that ZIP codes are used for mail delivery, and they often correspond to areas, but they don't always follow a strict geographic order. However, for a rough idea, I can look up where these ZIP codes are generally located.

32796 is for Zellwood, Florida, and 32751 is for Lake Helen, Florida. I think I need to confirm that.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I should recall or find out the cities associated with these ZIP codes.

I remember that in Florida, ZIP codes starting with 327 are in the central part of the state. 327 is the prefix for the Seminole County area, but it covers a broader region.

Let me list out what I know:

- 32751: I think this is for Lake Helen, which is near Deland in Volusia County.

- 32796: This is Zellwood, which is in Orange County, near Apopka.

Now, to compare their positions, I need to know if Zellwood is north of Lake Helen.

I should think about the cities' locations. Lake Helen is close to Deland, and Deland is north of Orlando. Zellwood is northwest of Orlando, near Apopka.

Let me sketch a mental map of Florida.

Orlando is roughly in the center of Florida. North of Orlando is Seminole County, and further north is Volusia County, where Deland and Lake Helen are.

Volusia County is on the east coast, but Deland is inland. Daytona Beach is on the coast, Deland is west of Daytona.

Lake Helen is a small town near Deland.

Zellwood is in Orange County, which is where Orlando is, but Zellwood is north of Orlando, near the Lake County border.

Apopka is a city in northwest Orange County, and Zellwood is nearby.

Now, to compare latitudes:

I need approximate latitudes.

I can look up the coordinates, but since this is a reasoning process, maybe I can estimate.

I know that Orlando is at about 28.5 degrees north latitude.

Deland is north of Orlando. Let me think.

From memory, Daytona Beach is at about 29.2 degrees north, and Deland is slightly inland, so similar latitude, maybe 29.1 or something.

I should be more systematic.

Perhaps I can think about the distance from a reference point.

Another idea: ZIP codes sometimes increase from south to north or east to west, but it's not consistent, so I can't rely on that.

For example, in Florida, 327 is central, 328 is Orlando area, 329 is east coast like Melbourne, 330 is south Florida, etc. But 327 covers a wide area.

32751 and 32796 are both in the 327 range, so they might be close.

32751 is Lake Helen, FL. Let me confirm the city.

I think 32751 is indeed Lake Helen.

32796 is Zellwood.

Now, let's find their coordinates.

Since I don't have a map, I need to reason geographically.

Lake Helen is in Volusia County, which is northeast of Orlando.

Zellwood is in Orange County, northwest of Orlando.

So, relative to Orlando, Lake Helen is northeast, Zellwood is northwest.

But for north-south, I need to see which has higher latitude.

Orlando latitude: approximately 28.5384° N.

Deland, FL: I think Deland is at about 29.0283° N.

Lake Helen is very close to Deland, so similar latitude, say 29.03° N.

Now Zellwood, FL: Zellwood is near Apopka.

Apopka, FL latitude is about 28.6611° N.

Zellwood should be similar, since it's adjacent.

Apopka is at 28.6611° N, which is north of Orlando's 28.5384° N, but south of Deland's 29.0283° N.

Orlando 28.54, Apopka 28.66, so Apopka is a bit north of Orlando, but Deland is about 29.03, which is further north.

So, Deland at 29.03 > Apopka at 28.66, so Lake Helen near Deland is north of Zellwood near Apopka.

Therefore, 32751 (Lake Helen) is north of 32796 (Zellwood).

But the question is if 32796 is north of 32751.

So, 32796 Zellwood vs 32751 Lake Helen.

Zellwood latitude ~28.66 N, Lake Helen ~29.03 N, so Lake Helen is north of Zellwood.

Thus, Zellwood is south of Lake Helen, so 32796 is not north of 32751.

In fact, it's south.

But let me double-check the cities.

Is 32751 definitely Lake Helen?

I think so. Let me confirm the ZIP codes.

I should be careful; sometimes ZIP codes can cover multiple areas.

But generally, 32751 is assigned to Lake Helen.

Similarly, 32796 to Zellwood.

Now, latitude of Zellwood, FL: I can think of Mount Dora or something, but Zellwood is specific.

Zellwood, FL: upon quick search in my mind, it's at approximately 28.7311° N or something? I think I have Apopka wrong.

Let me correct.

Apopka, FL: actually, Apopka is at 28.6931° N according to my memory, but let's standardize.

I recall that Orlando International Airport is at about 28.43 N, downtown Orlando around 28.54.

Apopka is northwest, so higher latitude. Yes, 28.67 N or so.

Deland: Volusia County, DeLand is at 29.0283° N.

Lake Helen is a small town just east of Deland, so latitude almost same, 29.02 N.

Zellwood: Zellwood is in north Orange County, near the Lake County border. Lake County has higher latitude.

Mount Dora is in Lake County at 28.8025° N, but Zellwood is south of that.

Zellwood coordinates: approximately 28.7311° N.

Yes, I think that's right.

So, Zellwood: 28.73 N

Lake Helen: 29.03 N

Difference: 29.03 - 28.73 = 0.30 degrees, which is about 20 miles north, since one degree is about 69 miles.

So, clearly, Lake Helen is north of Zellwood.

Therefore, 32751 is north of 32796.

So, 32796 is south of 32751, not north.

Thus, the answer should be no.

But the question is: "Is 32796, FL located north of 32751, FL?"

Based on this, no.

But let me make sure about the ZIP codes.

Perhaps I can think about the counties.

32751 is in Volusia County, which is north-central Florida.

32796 is in Orange County, which is central Florida, south of Volusia.

Volusia County is north of Orange County.

Yes, Orange County is south of Volusia County.

For example, the southern border of Volusia is about the same as the northern border of Orange, but cities in north Volusia are north of north Orange.

Deland is in Volusia, and it's north of Apopka in Orange.

Apopka is in northwest Orange, but still, latitude-wise, Deland is higher.

To be precise, latitude of Apopka city center: 28.6764° N

Latitude of DeLand city center: 29.0283° N

Lake Helen is very close to DeLand, at approximately 28.9800° N or something? I think it's slightly south but still higher than Apopka.

Lake Helen, FL: I believe it's at about 28.9806° N.

Similarly, Zellwood, FL: 28.7311° N.

So, 28.7311 vs 28.9806, so Zellwood is south.

28.7311 < 28.9806, so Zellwood has lower latitude, meaning it is south.

Therefore, 32796 (Zellwood) is south of 32751 (Lake Helen).

Hence, not north.

So, the answer is no.

But the question is to show step-by-step reasoning.

Also, perhaps I can confirm with another method.

ZIP code database or something, but I don't have access now.

I know that Florida has a general south to north increase in ZIP codes, but it's messy.

For example, 32708 is Winter Park, which is near Orlando, 32789 is Tavares, which is north, in Lake County.

Tavares is 32778, I think. 32778 is Tavares.

32789 is something else.

32796 is Zellwood, which is near 32703 Apopka, I think.

32703 is Apopka, at lower latitude than 32751.

32751 is Lake Helen.

32751 is higher number than 32703, but both in 327, so numerically higher, but geographically, Lake Helen is north of Apopka.

Apopka 32703, Lake Helen 32751, numerically 51>03, but since they are in different areas, it doesn't mean much.

In fact, 327 covers a wide range.

So, better to rely on actual geography.

Another way: I can think of the distance from equator.

But I think I have enough.

So, based on latitude:

32796, Zellwood: approx 28.73° N

32751, Lake Helen: approx 28.98° N

Since 28.73 < 28.98, Zellwood is south, so not north of Lake Helen.

Therefore, 32796 is not north of 32751.

Final answer: No.

But to be thorough, let's see if there's any mistake.

Perhaps 32796 is for a different place.

32796: I think it's Zellwood, Florida.

Similarly, 32751 is Lake Helen.

Yes.

I can think about highways or something.

Lake Helen is near I-4 and US-92, east of Deland.

Zellwood is near US-441, north of Orlando.

But I-4 runs from Tampa to Daytona, through Orlando.

Deland is north of Orlando on I-4, Apopka is northwest, not on I-4 directly.

From Orlando, going north on I-4, you reach Longwood, then Sanford, then Deland, etc.

Apopka is west, so you take other roads.

But in terms of north-south, Deland is north of Apopka.

For example, exit numbers on I-4: Orlando around exit 80, Deland around exit 114, so higher number north.

Apopka is not on I-4, but it's at a latitude similar to Altamonte Springs, which is exit 92 or so, while Deland is exit 114, so Deland is north.

Therefore, Lake Helen near Deland is north of Zellwood near Apopka.

So, confirmed.

Thus, 32796 is not north of 32751.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

To determine if ZIP code 32796, FL is located north of ZIP code 32751, FL, we need to compare the geographic locations of these ZIP codes, specifically their latitudes. ZIP codes do not always follow a strict geographic order, so we must identify the cities or areas associated with each ZIP code and then compare their latitudes.

1. **Identify the locations for each ZIP code:**
   - ZIP code 32751 is assigned to **Lake Helen, Florida**. Lake Helen is a small city in Volusia County, located in the east-central part of Florida.
   - ZIP code 32796 is assigned to **Zellwood, Florida**. Zellwood is an unincorporated community in Orange County, located in the central part of Florida, near the city of Apopka.

2. **Determine approximate latitudes:**
   - Latitude is measured in degrees north of the equator. A higher latitude means a location is farther north.
   - **Lake Helen, FL (32751):** The approximate latitude is 29.03°N. This is based on Lake Helen's location near DeLand (which is at approximately 29.0283°N) and its position in northern Volusia County.
   - **Zellwood, FL (32796):** The approximate latitude is 28.73°N. This is derived from Zellwood's location near Apopka (which is at approximately 28.6764°N) and its position in northern Orange County, close to the Lake County border.

3. **Compare the latitudes:**
   - Lake Helen latitude: 29.03°N
   - Zellwood latitude: 28.73°N
   - Since 28.73°N is less than 29.03°N, Zellwood is south of Lake Helen.

4. **Geographic context:**
   - Volusia County (where Lake Helen is located) is generally north of Orange County (where Zellwood is located).
   - Lake Helen is northeast of Orlando, while Zellwood is northwest of Orlando. However, when comparing strictly north-south, Lake Helen's latitude is higher, placing it north of Zellwood.
   - The latitude difference of about 0.30 degrees translates to roughly 20 miles (since 1 degree of latitude is about 69 miles). This confirms that Lake Helen is significantly north of Zellwood.

5. **Conclusion based on comparison:**
   - Since Zellwood (32796) has a lower latitude than Lake Helen (32751), it is not north of Lake Helen. Instead, Zellwood is south of Lake Helen.

**Final Answer: No**
