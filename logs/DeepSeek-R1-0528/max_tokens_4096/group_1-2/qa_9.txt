*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey died later than Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy. That means I have to find out their death dates and compare them.

I should start by recalling who these historical figures are. William de Warenne was a Norman nobleman who fought in the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and was later made the Earl of Surrey. Agnes of Aquitaine was related to the Dukes of Aquitaine and married to the Count of Savoy.

Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy—I think she might also be known as Agnes of Poitou or something similar. I need to get the dates right.

Let me look up William de Warenne first. From what I remember, William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, was born around the 11th century and died in 1088. I think he died in 1088. Let me confirm that.

Upon a quick mental search, William de Warenne was created Earl of Surrey in 1088, but I think he died the same year. No, he was created earl in 1088 and died later? I need to be precise.

Actually, I recall that William de Warenne died in 1088. Let me think: he was involved in the rebellion against William II in 1088, and he was killed during that time. Yes, he died in 1088.

Now, for Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy. I believe she was the daughter of William V, Duke of Aquitaine. She married Otto of Savoy or something. Let me get her details.

Agnes of Aquitaine, also known as Agnes of Poitiers, was born around 1025 and died in 1077. I think she died in 1077. She was married to Peter I of Savoy.

Peter I was Count of Savoy from 1060 to 1078, and Agnes died in 1077. Yes, that sounds familiar.

So, let's list the death years:

- William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey: died in 1088

- Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy: died in 1077

Now, comparing 1088 and 1077, 1088 is later than 1077. So, William died later than Agnes.

But I need to make sure these dates are accurate. I should double-check to avoid mistakes.

Let me think about William de Warenne. He was a companion of William the Conqueror. After the conquest, he was granted lands and became Earl of Surrey. The earldom was created in 1088, but he might have died soon after.

Upon recollection, William de Warenne died on June 24, 1088, during the siege of Pevensey Castle. Yes, 1088.

Now for Agnes. Agnes of Aquitaine, daughter of William V, Duke of Aquitaine, and Agnes of Burgundy. She married Henry, Count of Burgundy, but then later Peter I, Count of Savoy.

I think she died in 1077. Let me confirm: Peter I of Savoy died in 1078, and Agnes died before him in 1077.

Yes, historical records show Agnes died in 1077.

So, death years:

- Agnes: 1077

- William: 1088

1088 is 11 years after 1077, so William died later.

Therefore, the answer should be yes.

The question is: did William die later than Agnes? Yes, since 1088 > 1077.

But just to be thorough, is there any confusion with names? Agnes of Aquitaine might be confused with others, but I think this is the one.

Sometimes Agnes of Aquitaine could refer to different people, but in the context of Countess of Savoy, it should be Agnes, wife of Peter I of Savoy.

Similarly, William de Warenne is clearly the 1st Earl of Surrey.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey: died in 1088.

2. Identify Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy: died in 1077.

3. Compare death years: 1088 is greater than 1077.

4. Therefore, William died later than Agnes.

Final answer: Yes.
