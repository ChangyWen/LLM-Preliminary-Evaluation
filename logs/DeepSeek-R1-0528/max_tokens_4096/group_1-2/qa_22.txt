*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Dal-Tex Building, TX located south of Lake Martin, AL?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to figure out the locations. Dal-Tex Building is in Texas, and Lake Martin is in Alabama. So, I'm comparing a place in Texas to a place in Alabama.

I know that Texas is generally west of Alabama. Alabama is in the southeastern United States, and Texas is in the south-central part, but more to the west. So, Texas is west of Alabama, not south.

But the question is about being south, not west. I need to think about latitude because "south" refers to a lower latitude.

Latitude measures how far north or south something is. Lower latitude means further south.

So, I need the latitudes of both places.

First, let's find the location of Dal-Tex Building. I believe Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, Texas. I think it's that building associated with the JFK assassination, but for location, it's in Dallas.

Confirming: Yes, the Dal-Tex Building is at 501 Elm Street, Dallas, Texas.

Now, for Lake Martin, Alabama. Lake Martin is a reservoir in Alabama, located in Tallapoosa, Elmore, and Coosa counties. I think it's near the city of Alexander City or something. But I need the general area.

To compare latitudes, I need approximate latitudes.

First, latitude of Dallas, Texas. Dallas is around 32.8°N latitude. I think it's about 32.78°N.

Now, Lake Martin, Alabama. Where is Lake Martin exactly? Lake Martin is in east-central Alabama. Major cities nearby are Montgomery or Birmingham, but Lake Martin itself.

Alexander City, Alabama is on the shores of Lake Martin. Alexander City's latitude is about 32.94°N or something. I need to be precise.

Since I don't have a map, I should recall general geography.

Alabama is north of Florida, and Texas has parts that are south of Alabama.

Dallas, Texas: Latitude approximately 32.8°N.

Now, for Lake Martin, Alabama. Let me find a reference point. Montgomery, Alabama is about 32.36°N. But Lake Martin is north of Montgomery.

Lake Martin is north of Montgomery. Montgomery is at 32.36°N, and Birmingham, Alabama is at about 33.52°N. Lake Martin is between them, closer to the south.

Alexander City, AL: Latitude 32.944°N. I think that's right.

Let me assume:

- Dal-Tex Building, Dallas, TX: Latitude ~32.78°N

- Lake Martin, AL: Since Alexander City is on it, ~32.94°N

Now, comparing:

32.78°N vs 32.94°N

32.78 is less than 32.94, which means Dallas is at a lower latitude than Alexander City/Lake Martin.

Lower latitude means further south.

So, 32.78°N is south of 32.94°N.

Therefore, Dallas, TX is south of Lake Martin, AL.

Since Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, it should be south.

But let me double-check the latitudes.

I can think in terms of map directions.

Texas is southwest of Alabama, but specifically for these points.

Dallas is in north Texas, and Lake Martin is in central Alabama.

Central Alabama latitude: Average might be around 32-33°N.

Dallas: 32.78°N

Now, let's get a better latitude for Lake Martin.

Lake Martin coordinates: I think it's approximately 32.7°N to 32.9°N or something. Alexander City is 32.944°N, but the lake spans a bit.

The center or a point on the lake might be around 32.8°N.

I recall that parts of Texas are south of parts of Alabama.

For example, Houston, Texas is at about 29.76°N, which is south of Alabama.

But Dallas is more north.

Dallas latitude: 32.7758°N (I looked it up mentally, but since I can't, I'll use common knowledge).

Similarly, for Lake Martin: Let's take Alexander City as proxy: 32.9444°N.

So, Dallas: 32.78°N

Alexander City: 32.94°N

Difference: 32.94 - 32.78 = 0.16 degrees, which is about 11.1 miles north (since 1 degree latitude is about 69 miles).

So, Alexander City is about 11 miles north of Dallas.

Therefore, Dallas is south of Alexander City.

Since Lake Martin is at Alexander City, Dal-Tex Building should be south.

But is Lake Martin exactly at that point? The lake is large, but generally around there.

Another point: Eclectic, Alabama is on Lake Martin, at 32.635°N. I think.

Eclectic, AL: 32.635°N

Dallas: 32.78°N

Now, 32.78 > 32.635, so Dallas is north of Eclectic.

That's a problem.

Lake Martin spans from about 32.6°N to 33.0°N or something.

I need a specific point.

Since the lake is in Alabama, and Dallas is in Texas, but for comparison, we can take the centroid or a common reference.

But the question is "south of Lake Martin, AL", meaning is it located to the south of the lake.

So, if Dallas is at 32.78°N, and parts of Lake Martin are south of that, like Eclectic at 32.635°N, which is south of Dallas, then Dallas is north of that point.

But Lake Martin as a whole, is Dallas south of the entire lake or compared to its location.

Typically, when we say "south of" a place, we mean that the place is north of it, so the location in question has lower latitude.

But for a large feature like a lake, it might have multiple points.

I think for practical purposes, we consider the general area.

Let me find the latitude range of Lake Martin.

Upon recall, Lake Martin is located between approximately 32.6°N and 32.9°N.

For example:

- Northern part: near Dadeville, AL, which is about 32.83°N

- Southern part: near Eclectic, 32.635°N

Dallas is at 32.78°N.

Now, 32.78°N compared to:

- If we take Eclectic at 32.635°N, Dallas at 32.78°N is north of it.

- If we take Dadeville at 32.83°N, Dallas at 32.78°N is south of it.

So, relative to the southern part of the lake, Dallas is north, and relative to the northern part, Dallas is south.

Therefore, it depends on which part of the lake we're considering.

But the question says "south of Lake Martin, AL", which might be interpreted as south of the entire lake or south of its location.

In geography, when we say a point is south of a feature, it means that the entire feature is north of the point, so the point must be south of the southernmost point of the feature.

Similarly, for "north of", it must be north of the northernmost point.

For example, if a city is south of a lake, it should be that the lake is entirely north of the city, meaning the city has lower latitude than the southern tip of the lake.

Let's think: If Lake Martin's southernmost point is at about 32.635°N (Eclectic area), and Dallas is at 32.78°N, which is greater than 32.635, so Dallas is north of the southern part of the lake.

Therefore, Dallas is not south of Lake Martin because part of the lake is south of Dallas.

Similarly, the northern part is at 32.83°N, so Dallas is south of that, but not south of the whole lake.

To be south of Lake Martin, Dal-Tex Building would need to be south of the southernmost point of the lake.

Southernmost point of Lake Martin is approximately 32.63°N or so.

Dallas at 32.78°N is north of that.

32.78 > 32.63, so latitude higher, meaning further north.

Therefore, Dal-Tex Building is north of the southern part of Lake Martin.

So, it is not located south of Lake Martin; in fact, part of Lake Martin is south of it.

Let's confirm the latitudes.

I should use more precise coordinates.

Dal-Tex Building address: 501 Elm Street, Dallas, TX 75202

Coordinates: Approximately 32.7800°N, 96.7967°W

Now, Lake Martin: I need coordinates for a southern point.

For example, the dam or something. Martin Dam is at 32.635°N, 85.933°W or something.

Let's say the southern end is around 32.63°N.

Dallas: 32.78°N

32.78°N vs 32.63°N: 32.78 is larger, so Dallas is north of that point.

Therefore, since the lake extends south to about 32.63°N, and Dallas is at 32.78°N, which is north, so Dal-Tex Building is not south of Lake Martin.

In fact, Lake Martin is partly south of Dallas.

To be thorough, let's find the min latitude of Lake Martin.

Upon quick search in memory, Lake Martin's southernmost point is near the dam, at about 32.63°N.

For instance, Eclectic, AL is at 32.635°N, and it's on the lake.

Dallas at 32.78°N is about 0.145 degrees north, which is about 10 miles north.

So, Dal-Tex Building is north of the southern shore of Lake Martin.

Therefore, it is not located south of Lake Martin.

The question is "south of Lake Martin", which I think means the building is south of the lake, implying the lake is north of it.

But since part of the lake is south of Dallas, Dallas cannot be south of the lake.

Similarly, for the building specifically.

Final answer should be no.

But let's make sure about the locations.

Another way: Texas and Alabama share a longitudinal line, but Alabama is east.

Dallas is around 96.8°W, Lake Martin is around 85.9°W, so different longitudes, but for north-south, latitude is key.

Since Dallas is west, but latitude-wise, it's comparable.

I recall that the southernmost point of Alabama is around 30.2°N (Gulf Coast), and northernmost around 35°N, but Lake Martin is in central Alabama.

Central Alabama latitudes: Montgomery is 32.36°N, Birmingham is 33.52°N, Lake Martin is between, say 32.6 to 33.0°N.

Dallas is at 32.78°N, which is within the range of Lake Martin's latitude.

Since Lake Martin spans from about 32.63°N to 32.92°N or so, and Dallas at 32.78°N is within that band, so it is not strictly south or north; it's at similar latitude.

But the question is "located south of", which might imply directly south or generally south.

In common parlance, since it's at the same latitude or slightly north of the southern part, it's not considered south.

For example, if two places have the same latitude, one is not south of the other; they are at the same latitude.

Here, Dallas at 32.78°N and Lake Martin southern point at 32.63°N, so Dallas is north.

Therefore, Dal-Tex Building is not south of Lake Martin.

I think the answer should be no.

But let's see the initial thought: I thought Dallas was south, but that was because I took Alexander City at 32.94°N, which is north, but the lake extends south.

So, to be accurate, no.

Perhaps the question means relative to the center or something, but I think standard is to consider if it's south of the entire feature.

Another example: Is Miami south of Lake Michigan? Yes, because all of Lake Michigan is north of Miami.

Similarly, here, for Dal-Tex to be south of Lake Martin, all of Lake Martin must be north of Dal-Tex.

But since the southern part of Lake Martin is at 32.63°N and Dal-Tex at 32.78°N, 32.63 < 32.78, so southern part is south of Dal-Tex, meaning Lake Martin is not entirely north; part is south.

Therefore, Dal-Tex is not south of Lake Martin.

So, the answer is no.

Final reasoning:

- Dal-Tex Building, Dallas, TX: Latitude approximately 32.78°N

- Lake Martin, AL: Southernmost point approximately 32.63°N

- Since 32.63°N < 32.78°N, the southern part of Lake Martin is south of Dal-Tex Building.

- Therefore, Dal-Tex Building is not located south of Lake Martin; part of the lake is south of it.

Hence, the answer is No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine if the Dal-Tex Building in Texas is located south of Lake Martin in Alabama, I need to compare their geographic positions, specifically their latitudes. Latitude measures how far north or south a location is, with lower latitudes being further south. I will use approximate coordinates for key points to make the comparison.

1. **Identify the location of Dal-Tex Building, TX:**
   - The Dal-Tex Building is located at 501 Elm Street, Dallas, Texas.
   - The approximate coordinates for Dallas, Texas, are:
     - Latitude: 32.78°N
     - Longitude: 96.80°W
   - Since the building is in Dallas, we can use these coordinates as a reference.

2. **Identify the location of Lake Martin, AL:**
   - Lake Martin is a large reservoir in Alabama, spanning parts of Tallapoosa, Elmore, and Coosa counties.
   - It is not a single point but a geographic feature with a range of latitudes. To determine if Dal-Tex is south of the lake, I need to consider the southernmost point of Lake Martin, as this defines the boundary for "south of" comparisons.
   - The southern end of Lake Martin is near the town of Eclectic, Alabama, which is on the lake's shore.
   - Approximate coordinates for Eclectic, Alabama (representing the southernmost point of Lake Martin):
     - Latitude: 32.63°N
     - Longitude: 85.92°W
   - Lake Martin extends northward to higher latitudes (e.g., around 32.94°N near Alexander City), but for "south of" to hold true, Dal-Tex must be south of the entire lake, meaning it must have a lower latitude than the southernmost point of the lake.

3. **Compare the latitudes:**
   - Dal-Tex Building (Dallas, TX) latitude: 32.78°N
   - Southernmost point of Lake Martin (Eclectic, AL) latitude: 32.63°N
   - Numerically, 32.78°N is greater than 32.63°N, meaning Dal-Tex Building is at a higher latitude than the southern end of Lake Martin.
   - Since latitude increases as you go north, a higher latitude means a position further north. Therefore:
     - 32.78°N (Dal-Tex) is north of 32.63°N (southern Lake Martin).
     - This also means that part of Lake Martin (specifically, the southern end) is south of Dal-Tex Building.

4. **Determine if Dal-Tex is south of Lake Martin:**
   - For Dal-Tex to be considered "south of Lake Martin," it must be positioned such that the entire lake is north of it. In other words, Dal-Tex should have a lower latitude than the southernmost point of the lake.
   - Here, Dal-Tex latitude (32.78°N) > southern Lake Martin latitude (32.63°N), so Dal-Tex is not south of the lake. Instead, it is north of the southern part of the lake.
   - Additionally, since the longitudes differ (Dallas is around 96.80°W, Lake Martin around 85.92°W), this does not affect the north-south comparison, as latitude is the primary factor for "south of" determinations.

5. **Conclusion based on comparison:**
   - Dal-Tex Building is not south of Lake Martin because:
     - It is at a higher latitude than the southernmost point of the lake.
     - Part of Lake Martin is actually south of Dal-Tex Building.
   - Therefore, the answer is no.

**Final Answer: No**
