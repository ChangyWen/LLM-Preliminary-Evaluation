*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Pine Flat Dam in California is east of St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church in Nevada. I should start by finding the locations of both places.

Pine Flat Dam is in California. I think it's in the Sierra Nevada mountains, near Fresno. Let me confirm that. Pine Flat Dam is on the Kings River, and it's east of Fresno, California.

St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church is in Virginia City, Nevada. Virginia City is in the western part of Nevada, near Reno.

Now, I need to figure out the relative positions. Specifically, is Pine Flat Dam east of the church?

Let me think about the geography. California and Nevada share a border, with Nevada to the east of California. So, generally, places in California are west of places in Nevada. But Pine Flat Dam is in central California, and St. Mary’s is in western Nevada, so I need to be more precise.

I should look up the coordinates to compare them accurately.

Let me find the latitude and longitude for both.

First, Pine Flat Dam, CA:

- Latitude: Approximately 36.8327° N

- Longitude: Approximately 119.3172° W

I think that's right. Pine Flat Dam is near Fresno, which is around 36.7° N, 119.8° W, but the dam itself might be slightly different. Let's use 36.8327° N, 119.3172° W for Pine Flat Dam.

Now, St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, Virginia City, NV:

- Virginia City coordinates: Approximately 39.3099° N, 119.6497° W

The church should be around there. Let me confirm.

St. Mary’s in the Mountains is at 111 S E St, Virginia City, NV. Coordinates: about 39.3103° N, 119.6502° W.

I'll use that.

So, Pine Flat Dam: 36.8327° N, 119.3172° W

St. Mary’s Church: 39.3103° N, 119.6502° W

Now, to determine if Pine Flat Dam is east of the church, I need to compare their longitudes.

Longitude measures east-west position. A smaller longitude value (less negative or more positive) means further east, since longitude decreases as you go west.

Longitude is measured from the Prime Meridian (0°), with positive values east and negative values west in some systems, but commonly in the US, we use west longitude, so it's negative or stated as degrees west.

In this case, both are in the western hemisphere, so longitude is west, meaning the values are negative when expressed in decimal degrees, but often we just use the number with W.

For comparison, a smaller numerical value of west longitude means it's further east.

For example, 119° W is east of 120° W because 119 is less than 120, so closer to the Prime Meridian.

Numerically, since it's west longitude, a smaller number means east-er.

Let's clarify:

- Longitude: 0° at Prime Meridian, increases to 180° east or west.

But for the US, longitudes are west, so from 65° W to 125° W or so.

As you go east, west longitude decreases.

So, for two points:

If point A has longitude W1 and point B has longitude W2, both west.

If W1 < W2, then point A is east of point B.

Because smaller west longitude means closer to zero, so more east.

For example, New York at about 74° W is east of Los Angeles at 118° W, since 74 < 118.

Similarly here.

So, Pine Flat Dam longitude: 119.3172° W

St. Mary’s Church longitude: 119.6502° W

Now, compare 119.3172 and 119.6502.

119.3172 is less than 119.6502.

Therefore, since smaller west longitude, Pine Flat Dam is east of St. Mary’s Church.

Is that right?

119.3172 W vs. 119.6502 W.

119.3172 is smaller number, so yes, it is further east.

Let me confirm the values.

Pine Flat Dam: approximately 119.3172° W

St. Mary’s: approximately 119.6502° W

Yes, 119.3172 < 119.6502, so Pine Flat Dam has a smaller west longitude, meaning it is east of St. Mary’s.

But let's make sure about the coordinates.

I should double-check the locations.

Pine Flat Dam, CA: It's in Fresno County, on the Kings River. Coordinates from a reliable source.

Upon quick search in my mind, I recall Pine Flat Dam is at 36.832° N, 119.317° W. That should be fine.

St. Mary’s in the Mountains: Virginia City, NV. Virginia City is at about 39.31° N, 119.65° W.

Yes.

Now, also, latitude isn't relevant for east-west, only longitude.

But just to note, Pine Flat is at 36.83° N, St. Mary’s at 39.31° N, so St. Mary’s is north of Pine Flat, but that doesn't affect the east-west question.

So, longitude comparison: 119.3172 W vs. 119.6502 W.

Difference: 119.6502 - 119.3172 = 0.333 degrees.

Each degree of longitude is about 69 miles at the equator, but since we're at around 37-39° latitude, it's less.

But roughly, the difference is about 0.333 degrees.

At 38° N, one degree longitude is about 69 * cos(38°) miles.

cos(38°) ≈ 0.788, so about 54.4 miles per degree.

Thus, 0.333 * 54.4 ≈ 18.1 miles.

So, Pine Flat Dam is about 18 miles east of St. Mary’s longitude-wise? No.

Pine Flat longitude 119.3172 W is smaller than St. Mary’s 119.6502 W, so Pine Flat is east by about 0.333 degrees, which is roughly 18 miles east at that latitude.

But is Pine Flat east or west?

Let me think: smaller longitude number means east.

For instance, Reno, NV is at about 119.8° W, and it's west of Virginia City? Virginia City is at 119.65° W, Reno is at 119.81° W, so Virginia City is east of Reno since 119.65 < 119.81.

Similarly, Fresno, CA is at about 119.77° W, and Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno.

Pine Flat Dam is at 119.32° W, Fresno is around 119.77° W, so yes, Pine Flat is east of Fresno.

Now, St. Mary’s at 119.65° W.

So, 119.32 W vs. 119.65 W.

119.32 is less than 119.65, so Pine Flat (119.32 W) is east of St. Mary’s (119.65 W).

Numerically: 119.32 < 119.65, so smaller longitude, therefore east.

To avoid confusion, let's think in terms of decimal degrees west.

A point with longitude 119.32° W is closer to the Prime Meridian than 119.65° W, so it is further east.

Yes.

I can also think about the map.

Virginia City, NV is near Lake Tahoe, which is on the California-Nevada border, but Virginia City is east of the lake, in Nevada.

Pine Flat Dam is in California, south of there, and east of Fresno.

But relatively, from Virginia City, which is at about 119.65° W, Pine Flat at 119.32° W is to the east.

Let me sketch a mental map.

The California-Nevada border runs north-south. Reno, NV is at about 119.81° W, Virginia City at 119.65° W, so Virginia City is east of Reno.

Now, Pine Flat Dam in CA is at 119.32° W, which is even smaller, so further east.

For example, the longitude of the border: the Sierra Nevada crest is roughly at 120° W in the north, but varies.

In the area, Lake Tahoe is at about 120° W on the west, but the border is along the lake.

But Virginia City is at 119.65° W, which is east of the border.

Pine Flat is at 119.32° W, which is west of the border? No.

The border between CA and NV is approximately along 120° W in some parts, but not exactly.

In central California, the border is around 120° W, but Pine Flat is at 119.32° W, which is east of 120° W.

119.32° W is about 119 degrees, which is east of, say, San Francisco at 122° W.

Compared to Virginia City at 119.65° W.

So, 119.32 is east of 119.65.

Therefore, Pine Flat Dam is east of St. Mary’s.

But St. Mary’s is in Nevada, which is east of California, but since Pine Flat is in central California and St. Mary’s is in western Nevada, it might be possible.

Another way: let's find a common reference.

For example, the Prime Meridian.

Point with longitude 119.32° W is at 360° - 119.32° from east, but better to think in terms of west longitude.

The smaller the west longitude number, the more east it is.

So, 119.32 < 119.65, so Pine Flat is east.

I could use positive east, but I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let's assume coordinates.

Set longitude: negative for west, as in many systems.

So, Pine Flat Dam: longitude ≈ -119.3172

St. Mary’s: longitude ≈ -119.6502

Now, -119.3172 is greater than -119.6502 because -119.3172 is less negative.

-119.3172 > -119.6502

In terms of position, a greater value (less negative) means further east.

For example, -119 is east of -120.

Yes, so -119.3172 > -119.6502, so Pine Flat has a greater longitude value (less negative), so it is east of St. Mary’s.

Therefore, Pine Flat Dam is east of St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church.

But is that correct geographically?

Let me think about cities.

Fresno, CA: about 119.77° W or -119.77

Pine Flat: -119.32, so east of Fresno.

Virginia City, NV: -119.65

Now, -119.32 vs. -119.65: -119.32 is greater, so east.

But Virginia City is in Nevada, which is east of California, but at this point, since Pine Flat is further east in California, it might be east of Virginia City.

For example, the longitude of the Nevada border is approximately 120° W in the south, but at Virginia City's latitude, it's around 120° W or less.

Virginia City is at about 39.3° N, and the CA-NV border at that latitude is near Lake Tahoe, which has longitudes around 120° W on the west shore, but the border is through the lake.

Virginia City is east of the lake, at 119.65° W.

Pine Flat is at 36.83° N, 119.32° W.

The border at 36.83° N is approximately 120° W, since the border is a straight line from Lake Tahoe south, roughly along 120° W.

But Pine Flat at 119.32° W is east of 120° W, so it's east of the border? No.

120° W is west of 119° W.

Longitude: 120° W is further west than 119° W.

For example, 118° W is east, 119° W, 120° W west.

So, at 36.83° N, the CA-NV border is approximately 120° W longitude.

Pine Flat at 119.32° W is east of 120° W, so it should be east of the border? But it's in California, so west of the border.

I think I'm confusing myself.

California is west of Nevada.

The border runs north-south.

At a given latitude, points west of the border are in California, east are in Nevada.

But the border longitude varies.

For instance, at 39° N, the border is near 120° W at the crest, but Virginia City is at 119.65° W, which is east of 120° W, so in Nevada.

Similarly, at 37° N, the border is around 120° W.

Pine Flat at 36.83° N, 119.32° W.

119.32° W compared to border longitude.

At 36.83° N, the border is approximately 119.9° W or something? I need to be precise.

I should not rely on border; just compare longitudes directly.

Pine Flat: 119.32° W

St. Mary’s: 119.65° W

119.32 < 119.65, so Pine Flat has smaller west longitude, so it is east of St. Mary’s.

To confirm, let's find the distance.

Difference in longitude: 119.65 - 119.32 = 0.33 degrees.

At latitude 38° (average), cos(38°) = 0.788, so degrees to miles: 69 * 0.788 ≈ 54.4 miles per degree longitude.

So, 0.33 * 54.4 ≈ 18 miles.

So, Pine Flat is about 18 miles east of St. Mary’s longitude-wise.

But St. Mary’s is in Nevada, and Pine Flat in California, but since St. Mary’s is at a higher latitude, and Pine Flat is south and east.

In terms of east-west, yes, Pine Flat is slightly east.

But is it possible? Let me think about a map.

Virginia City, NV is west of Carson City, which is at about 119.76° W, and Virginia City at 119.65° W is east.

Pine Flat, CA is near Fresno, which is at 119.77° W, and Pine Flat is at 119.32° W, so east of Fresno.

Fresno at 119.77° W, Virginia City at 119.65° W, so Virginia City is east of Fresno because 119.65 < 119.77.

119.65 W is smaller than 119.77 W, so Virginia City is east of Fresno.

Pine Flat at 119.32 W is even smaller, so further east than Virginia City.

Therefore, Pine Flat is east of Virginia City, and thus east of St. Mary’s.

But St. Mary’s is in Virginia City, so same.

So, Pine Flat Dam, CA is located east of St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV.

But that seems counterintuitive because Nevada is east of California, but in this case, since Pine Flat is in eastern California and St. Mary’s is in western Nevada, and Pine Flat is further east in terms of longitude.

Yes, that makes sense.

I can think of the actual locations.

Pine Flat Dam is near Sanger, CA, which is east of Fresno.

St. Mary’s is in Virginia City, which is southeast of Reno.

Reno is at about 119.81 W, Virginia City at 119.65 W, so east.

From Reno to Virginia City, you go east.

Pine Flat is at 119.32 W, which is roughly the longitude of, say, Bishop, CA or something, but Bishop is around 118.4 W, which is further east.

Bishop, CA is at 118.4 W, which is east.

But 119.32 W is between Fresno and Bishop.

Fresno 119.77, Bishop 118.4, so Pine Flat 119.32 is closer to Fresno but east.

Virginia City 119.65 W is west of Pine Flat 119.32 W.

So yes, Pine Flat is east.

To be thorough, let's use exact coordinates from a reliable source.

Assuming my coordinates are correct.

Final answer should be yes.

The question is: "Is Pine Flat Dam, CA located east of St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV?"

Based on longitude, yes.

But let's confirm the church location.

St. Mary’s in the Mountains: 111 S E St, Virginia City, NV 89440

Coordinates: 39.3103° N, 119.6502° W

Pine Flat Dam: 36.8327° N, 119.3172° W

Longitude: Pine Flat 119.3172° W, St. Mary’s 119.6502° W

119.3172 < 119.6502, so Pine Flat has smaller west longitude, hence east.

Therefore, yes.

So, the answer is Yes.

But the question says "east of", and in geography, it might be approximate, but based on coordinates, it is east.

Perhaps I should consider if they are directly north-south, but no, there's a latitude difference, but for east-west, longitude is the key.

So, I think it's clear.
