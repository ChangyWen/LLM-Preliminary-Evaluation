*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Lake Martin, AL located south of Dal-Tex Building, TX?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to figure out the locations of these two places. Lake Martin is in Alabama (AL), and Dal-Tex Building is in Texas (TX). So, I'm comparing a point in Alabama to a point in Texas.

To determine if one place is south of another, I need their latitudes. The place with the lower latitude is further south, since latitude decreases as you go south.

I should find the approximate latitudes of both locations.

Starting with Dal-Tex Building in Texas. I think the Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, Texas. I recall that Dallas is a major city in Texas, and I believe the Dal-Tex Building is a historic building there. Let me confirm that.

Upon a quick mental search, I remember that the Dal-Tex Building is indeed in Dallas, Texas. It's known for being near Dealey Plaza, related to the JFK assassination.

Now, what's the latitude of Dallas, Texas? I think Dallas is around 32.8°N latitude. Let me be precise.

I know that the latitude of Dallas, Texas is approximately 32.7767°N. But for comparison, I might not need that much precision.

Similarly, for Lake Martin, Alabama. Lake Martin is a reservoir in Alabama. I need to find its location.

Lake Martin is in east-central Alabama. I think it's near cities like Alexander City or Dadeville. Let me find a representative point.

Since it's a lake, I should use the latitude of the lake itself. I believe Lake Martin is around 32.6°N to 32.8°N or something. I need to recall.

I can think about the general geography. Alabama is south of Tennessee and north of Florida. Texas is west, but for north-south, I need latitude.

Alabama is generally south of Tennessee and north of the Gulf of Mexico. Texas has parts that are further south, like the Rio Grande Valley.

But Dallas is in north Texas, which might be at a similar latitude to parts of Alabama.

Let me compare the latitudes.

First, Dallas, Texas latitude: approximately 32.78°N.

Now, for Lake Martin, Alabama. I think Lake Martin is in Tallapoosa County or nearby. Let me estimate.

I recall that Montgomery, Alabama, is the capital, and it's at about 32.36°N. But Lake Martin is north of Montgomery, I think.

Lake Martin is northeast of Montgomery. Alexander City is near Lake Martin, and Alexander City, AL, has a latitude of about 32.94°N.

Let me confirm that.

Upon thinking, Alexander City, Alabama, is at approximately 32.944°N latitude.

And since Lake Martin is right there, it should be similar.

I can use coordinates.

Let me state:

- Dal-Tex Building, Dallas, TX: Latitude ≈ 32.78°N

- Lake Martin, AL: I need a specific point. Let's take the dam or something. But roughly, the center of the lake or a nearby town.

Lake Martin spans multiple counties, but a common reference point is Martin Dam or the area near Alexander City.

Alexander City, AL: 32.944°N

Now, Dallas, TX: 32.7767°N

So, comparing:

Dallas: 32.78°N

Alexander City: 32.94°N

Since latitude is measured in degrees north, a higher number is further north.

32.94°N is north of 32.78°N because 32.94 > 32.78.

Therefore, Alexander City (near Lake Martin) is north of Dallas.

But is Lake Martin exactly at Alexander City? Lake Martin is a large lake, but the latitude should be similar.

Let me get the latitude of the lake itself.

Upon second thought, Lake Martin is at approximately 32.6°N to 32.9°N, but let's find an average.

I can use coordinates from memory or general knowledge.

Another way: Birmingham, Alabama is at about 33.52°N, which is north of Dallas. But Lake Martin is south of Birmingham.

Montgomery, AL is at 32.36°N, which is south of Dallas (32.78°N).

32.36 < 32.78, so Montgomery is south of Dallas.

But where is Lake Martin relative to Montgomery?

Lake Martin is about 50-60 miles northeast of Montgomery, so it should be at a higher latitude than Montgomery.

Let's calculate.

Montgomery: 32.36°N

Alexander City: approximately 32.94°N, as I thought.

Distance: from Montgomery to Alexander City is about 50 miles north. Since one degree of latitude is about 69 miles, so 50 miles is roughly 50/69 ≈ 0.72 degrees.

So, latitude of Alexander City: 32.36 + 0.72? No.

If going north from Montgomery, latitude increases.

Montgomery is at 32.36°N, and Alexander City is north of it, so latitude should be higher.

Montgomery to Alexander City is roughly northeast, but primarily north.

Approximate latitude difference: about 0.6 degrees or so.

I think Alexander City is at 32.94°N, which is about 0.58 degrees north of Montgomery (32.94 - 32.36 = 0.58).

Dallas at 32.78°N.

Now, 32.94°N vs. 32.78°N: 32.94 > 32.78, so Alexander City is north of Dallas.

Therefore, Lake Martin, being at approximately 32.94°N, is north of Dal-Tex Building at 32.78°N.

But is Lake Martin at the same latitude as Alexander City? Yes, the city is on the shore.

To be precise, let's get coordinates.

I can think about state positions.

Alabama and Texas share a similar latitude range, but north Texas is around 33-34°N, while Dallas is 32.78°N.

Alabama: northern border around 35°N, southern around 30°N or so.

Lake Martin is in central Alabama.

Central Alabama latitude: roughly 32.5°N to 33.5°N.

Dallas is at 32.78°N, which is in the south-central part of the US.

Lake Martin: let's say it's around 32.8°N or so? Earlier I have 32.94°N.

I might be wrong.

Let me double-check the latitude of Lake Martin.

Upon recollection, Martin Dam, which is on Lake Martin, is at approximately 32.642°N, 85.933°W or something.

I need to look it up, but since I'm reasoning, I should use available knowledge.

I know that Houston, Texas is around 29.76°N, which is south, but Dallas is north.

For comparison, Mobile, Alabama is at 30.69°N, which is south of Dallas.

But Lake Martin is inland.

Another point: Selma, Alabama is at 32.41°N, which is south of Dallas (32.78°N).

Alexander City: I think it is 32.94°N.

Let me confirm with cities.

Tuscaloosa, AL: 33.21°N

Birmingham, AL: 33.52°N

Montgomery, AL: 32.36°N

Auburn, AL: 32.60°N

Alexander City, AL: I believe it's 32.94°N. Yes, I think that's correct.

Dallas, TX: 32.78°N

So, 32.94°N (Alexander City) minus 32.78°N (Dallas) = 0.16 degrees, which is about 11 miles north (since 1 degree ≈ 69 miles, 0.16*69≈11 miles).

So Alexander City is about 11 miles north of Dallas latitude.

Therefore, Lake Martin, being at that latitude, is north of Dal-Tex Building.

But the question is whether Lake Martin is south of Dal-Tex Building.

If Lake Martin is north, then it is not south; it's north.

But is Lake Martin exactly at Alexander City latitude? The lake covers an area, but generally, it's around 32.9°N.

To be thorough, let's find the southernmost point of Lake Martin.

Lake Martin extends south towards Dadeville or something.

Dadeville, AL is at 32.83°N, I think.

Dadeville: approximately 32.83°N

Still, 32.83°N vs. 32.78°N: 32.83 > 32.78, so still north.

32.83 - 32.78 = 0.05 degrees, about 3.45 miles north.

So even at its southern end, Lake Martin is slightly north of Dallas latitude.

But Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, at 32.78°N.

Lake Martin's latitude ranges from about 32.6°N to 32.9°N, but let's get specific.

Upon better recollection, the Martin Dam is at 32.642°N, which is south.

32.642°N? That might be south of Dallas.

Dallas is 32.78°N, so 32.642 < 32.78, meaning 32.642 is south of 32.78.

Latitude: lower number is south.

So 32.642°N is south of 32.78°N.

Now, where is Martin Dam? Martin Dam is on the Tallapoosa River and is part of Lake Martin.

The coordinates for Martin Dam are approximately 32.642°N, 85.933°W.

Yes, I think that's right.

Dallas, Texas: Dal-Tex Building is at 32.779°N, 96.808°W or something, but approximately 32.78°N.

So, Martin Dam: 32.642°N

Dallas: 32.78°N

32.642 < 32.78, so Martin Dam is south of Dallas.

But is Martin Dam considered part of Lake Martin? Yes, it's the dam that creates the lake.

Lake Martin itself has various points.

The center of the lake might be different, but the dam is a specific location.

Since the lake is large, but for geographical comparison, we can use a point.

Perhaps the question is about the location in general.

But to be precise, let's see.

If we take the dam at 32.642°N, it is south of Dallas 32.78°N.

Difference: 32.78 - 32.642 = 0.138 degrees, about 9.5 miles south.

So, at that point, Lake Martin is south of Dal-Tex Building.

But is that the only point? The lake extends north.

For example, near Alexander City, which is at 32.944°N, it is north.

So, parts of Lake Martin are north of Dallas, and parts are south? Let's see the latitude range.

Alexander City: 32.944°N

Martin Dam: 32.642°N

So the lake spans from about 32.64°N to 32.94°N.

Dallas: 32.78°N

So, south of 32.78°N would be from 32.64°N to 32.78°N, but 32.78 is equal, so strictly south would be less than.

32.78°N is the latitude.

Points at 32.64°N to just below 32.78°N are south of Dallas.

Points above are north.

Since the lake has areas both north and south of Dallas latitude, it depends on which part.

But typically, when we say "Lake Martin, AL", we might mean the general area or a central point.

In geographical terms, for such comparisons, we often use a central coordinate or a major feature.

But to answer "is it located south", if part of it is south, but the question might imply the primary location.

This is ambiguous.

Perhaps I should consider the city or the official location.

Lake Martin is not a city; it's a lake, so it has a geographic center.

Let me find the geographic center of Lake Martin.

Upon estimation, the center might be around 32.8°N or so.

But let's calculate.

From Martin Dam at 32.642°N to Alexander City at 32.944°N, difference about 0.3 degrees, so center around 32.793°N.

32.793°N vs. Dallas 32.78°N, so approximately the same, slightly north.

32.793 > 32.78, so very slightly north.

But at the dam, it's south.

For practical purposes, it's very close.

But the question is a strict south or not.

Another way: is there an official point?

Perhaps I can think in terms of the state.

But states are large.

I recall that the general area of Lake Martin is considered to be at a latitude similar to Dallas, but let's see a map mentally.

I know that the border between Alabama and Mississippi is around 32-33°N, and Texas is west.

Dallas is at about the same latitude as Shreveport, Louisiana, which is west of Alabama.

Shreveport is at 32.51°N, which is south of Dallas? 32.51 < 32.78, so south.

But for Alabama, Huntsville is north, Montgomery is south.

Lake Martin is between Birmingham and Montgomery.

Birmingham 33.52°N, Montgomery 32.36°N, so halfway might be around 32.94°N, which is Alexander City.

But earlier calculation shows Martin Dam south.

Let's use a reliable source in my mind.

I think for simplicity, the latitude of Lake Martin is often given as approximately 32.8°N for the area.

But let's assume from online knowledge, but I can't look it up.

Perhaps I can conclude that since the dam is at 32.642°N, which is south of 32.78°N, and the dam is part of Lake Martin, so technically, Lake Martin has a point that is south of Dal-Tex Building.

But the question is "is Lake Martin, AL located south", which might mean the entirety or the general location.

In geography, when we say a place is south of another, it usually means that the entire area is south, or the centroid is south.

Here, the centroid is approximately 32.8°N, same as Dallas, or slightly north.

But let's find the exact coordinates.

I can think about the Dal-Tex Building specifically.

Dal-Tex Building: 411 Elm Street, Dallas, TX 75202.

Coordinates: 32.7793°N, 96.8080°W

Now for Lake Martin, I need coordinates.

Lake Martin geographic center: approximately 32.798°N, 85.935°W or something.

Let's say from memory, it's around 32.8°N.

32.798°N vs. 32.7793°N: 32.798 > 32.7793, so about 0.0187 degrees north, which is about 1.3 miles north.

So very close, but technically north.

If I take Martin Dam: 32.642°N, which is less than 32.7793, so south.

But Martin Dam is at the southern end.

The city of Lake Martin isn't a city; the lake is the feature.

Perhaps the question refers to the lake as a whole.

To resolve, I think the safest way is to use the coordinates of the dam or a central point.

I found online in my memory that the main body of Lake Martin is between 32.6°N and 32.9°N, with Dallas at 32.78°N, so parts are south, parts are north.

But for the purpose of this question, since the difference is small, and the general location is considered similar latitude, but technically, the centroid is slightly north.

However, let's see the question: "located south of" – if we take a specific point like the dam, it is south.

But I think for such comparisons, we should use a central point or the most recognized location.

Another idea: look up the latitude of Alexander City, which is the largest town on the lake, at 32.944°N, clearly north.

Or Eclectic, Alabama, which is on the lake, at 32.635°N, which is south of Dallas (32.635 < 32.779).

Eclectic: 32.635°N, 86.034°W

32.635 < 32.779, so south.

So some towns on the lake are south, some are north of Dallas latitude.

Therefore, it's not entirely south or north; it depends.

But the lake itself spans both.

The question is about "Lake Martin, AL" as a location, so perhaps we can say it is not entirely south, but since it has points south, the answer might be yes for some parts.

But I think the question expects a binary yes or no for the location as a whole.

Perhaps in geographical terms, when asking if A is south of B, it means that A is directly south or the latitude is lower.

But here, the average latitude might be higher.

Let's calculate the average latitude of Lake Martin.

Min: 32.6°N, max: 32.9°N, average about 32.75°N.

Dallas 32.78°N, so 32.75 < 32.78, so very slightly south on average.

32.75 vs 32.78, difference 0.03 degrees, about 2 miles south.

So on average, it is south.

But this is rough.

I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let's use a specific point for Lake Martin.

In many contexts, the coordinates for Lake Martin are given as 32.800°N, 85.900°W for a central point.

32.800°N vs. Dal-Tex 32.779°N, 32.800 > 32.779, so north.

If I use 32.642 for the dam, it's south.

But the dam is not the lake; it's a structure.

The lake's center is around 32.8°N.

I think for the purpose of this question, since it's close, but technically, from standard sources, Lake Martin is not considered south of Dallas; they are at similar latitudes.

But let's think about state positions.

Alabama is generally east of Texas, but for north-south, central Alabama and north Texas are similar.

Specifically, Dallas is at about the same latitude as Montgomery, Alabama, which is 32.36°N, south of Dallas.

Montgomery 32.36°N < Dallas 32.78°N, so Montgomery is south.

Lake Martin is north of Montgomery, at 32.94°N, which is north of Dallas.

32.94 > 32.78.
