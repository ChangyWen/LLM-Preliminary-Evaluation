*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Lake Martin, Alabama is south of the Dal-Tex Building in Texas. To do this, I should compare their latitudes because "south" refers to a lower latitude.

Step 1: Find the latitude and longitude of Lake Martin, AL.

Lake Martin is a reservoir in Alabama. I think it's near the city of Alexander City. Let me confirm that. Yes, Lake Martin is in central Alabama, primarily in Tallapoosa County, but it spans a few counties. For latitude, I can use a central point or a well-known location on the lake.

I should look up the coordinates. Since I'm an AI, I have access to geographical data. The approximate coordinates for Lake Martin are around 32.6°N latitude and 85.8°W longitude. Let me double-check that.

Actually, I recall that Alexander City, which is on Lake Martin, has coordinates of about 32.9445°N, 85.9538°W. But Lake Martin is large, so I need a central point. Let's use the coordinates for the lake itself.

Upon checking my knowledge, Lake Martin's center is approximately 32.7°N, 85.8°W. I'll go with that.

Step 2: Find the latitude and longitude of the Dal-Tex Building in Texas.

The Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, Texas. It's a historic building, and I believe it's associated with the JFK assassination, but for location, it's in downtown Dallas.

The address is 501 Elm Street, Dallas, TX. The coordinates should be around 32.7790°N, 96.8080°W. Let me confirm.

Dallas is at approximately 32.7767°N, 96.7970°W. Since the Dal-Tex Building is in downtown, it should be similar. I'll use 32.779°N, 96.808°W as a good approximation.

Step 3: Compare the latitudes.

Lake Martin, AL: approximately 32.7°N

Dal-Tex Building, TX: approximately 32.779°N

Now, for "south," we care about the latitude. A lower latitude number means further south, since latitude decreases as you go south.

So, 32.7°N vs. 32.779°N.

32.7 is less than 32.779, so 32.7°N is south of 32.779°N.

Let me calculate the difference: 32.779 - 32.7 = 0.079 degrees. Since each degree is about 69 miles, that's roughly 5.45 miles south, but directionally, yes, it is south.

But is Lake Martin at 32.7°N? I should be more precise.

Let me get better coordinates.

For Lake Martin: According to reliable sources, the latitude ranges from about 32.5°N to 32.9°N, but the main body is around 32.6°N to 32.8°N. Alexander City is at 32.9445°N, but that's the city; the lake is south of it.

Lake Martin is south of Alexander City. Let me find a specific point.

Perhaps I can use the dam or something. Martin Dam is at 32.618°N, 85.920°W. I think that's a good reference.

Similarly, for Dal-Tex Building: 501 Elm St, Dallas, TX. Coordinates: 32.7791°N, 96.8085°W. (I can confirm this.)

So, Lake Martin Dam: 32.618°N

Dal-Tex Building: 32.7791°N

Now, 32.618°N is less than 32.7791°N, so Lake Martin Dam is south of Dal-Tex Building.

But the question is about Lake Martin, not specifically the dam. However, the dam is part of the lake, and the lake extends north and south, but the overall location is south.

To be thorough, let's see the northernmost point of Lake Martin. The lake goes up to near Dadeville, which is around 32.8°N or something.

Dadeville, AL: approximately 32.831°N, 85.764°W. That's north of the dam.

32.831°N is greater than 32.7791°N? Let's see: 32.831 vs 32.7791. 32.831 is higher, so if part of Lake Martin is at 32.831°N, that would be north of Dal-Tex Building.

But is Dadeville on Lake Martin? Let me check.

Lake Martin's northern end is near Eclectic, AL, which is about 32.635°N, 86.034°W. I need to get the extent.

According to a map, Lake Martin spans from approximately 32.5°N to 32.9°N latitude.

- Southern end: near Tallassee, AL, around 32.5°N

- Northern end: near Eclectic or Alexander City, around 32.9°N

Alexander City is at 32.9445°N, but the lake doesn't go that far north; the city is north of the lake.

Better to use coordinates:

- Northern point of Lake Martin: near Kowaliga, about 32.831°N (same as Dadeville area)

- Southern point: near Wind Creek State Park, about 32.522°N

Dal-Tex Building is at 32.7791°N.

Now, compare:

- Northern point of Lake Martin: 32.831°N

- Southern point: 32.522°N

- Dal-Tex: 32.7791°N

Since 32.522°N < 32.7791°N < 32.831°N, that means parts of Lake Martin are south of Dal-Tex (the southern part), and parts are north (the northern part).

But the question is: "Is Lake Martin, AL located south of Dal-Tex Building, TX?"

This is ambiguous. It could mean the entire lake, or a point, or generally.

In geography, when we say a place is south of another, it often means that the entire area is south, or the centroid is south.

Let's find the centroid of Lake Martin.

Approximate centroid: roughly 32.65°N, 85.8°W or something.

From earlier, Martin Dam at 32.618°N is a key point.

Many references use 32.6°N as a latitude for Lake Martin.

But let's see numerically.

Dal-Tex latitude: 32.7791°N

Lake Martin average latitude: Since it spans 32.5 to 32.9, the midpoint is about (32.5 + 32.9)/2 = 32.7°N.

32.7°N vs 32.7791°N: 32.7 < 32.7791, so average is south.

But the northern part is north.

For practical purposes, since the lake extends both sides, but the majority might be south.

Let's be precise.

I should consider if the lake as a whole is considered south.

But technically, since part of it is north, it's not entirely south.

However, in common usage, we might say it's south if the reference point is such that the location is predominantly south.

Dal-Tex is at 32.7791°N.

Lake Martin:

- Southern end: 32.522°N → south of Dal-Tex

- Northern end: 32.831°N → north of Dal-Tex (since 32.831 > 32.7791)

- Centroid: let's calculate. Latitude range 32.522 to 32.831, so midpoint (32.522 + 32.831)/2 = 65.353/2 = 32.6765°N

32.6765°N < 32.7791°N, so centroid is south of Dal-Tex.

Moreover, the southern part is closer to the centroid, but anyway.

Perhaps for the purpose of this question, since the centroid is south and the lake is often associated with areas south of Dallas, it might be considered south.

But let's think about the cities.

Dallas, TX is at about 32.78°N.

Alexander City, AL is at 32.94°N, which is north of Dallas, but Lake Martin is south of Alexander City.

Alexander City: 32.9445°N, Dallas: 32.7767°N, so Alexander City is north of Dallas.

But Lake Martin: the dam is at 32.618°N, which is south of Dallas.

Distance-wise, from Dallas to Lake Martin.

Dallas lat: 32.78°N

Lake Martin centroid: 32.68°N approx.

Difference: 32.78 - 32.68 = 0.1 degrees, about 6.9 miles south.

But since the lake extends north to 32.83°N, which is 32.83 - 32.78 = 0.05 degrees north, about 3.45 miles north of Dallas latitude.

So, technically, the northern tip of Lake Martin is north of Dal-Tex Building, but the majority of the lake is south.

However, the question is "is Lake Martin located south of" which might imply the entire thing.

In geography, if a place spans both sides, we don't say it's south; we say parts are south and parts are north.

But for simplicity, since the main body or the centroid is south, it might be acceptable.

I recall that Alabama is generally east of Texas, but for north-south, let's see the latitudes.

Texas has a southern latitude, but Dallas is in the north part of Texas.

Alabama is further east, but latitude-wise.

For example, Mobile, AL is at 30.6954°N, which is south, but Lake Martin is in central Alabama.

Central Alabama latitude: Birmingham is at 33.5207°N, which is north of Dallas, but Lake Martin is south of Birmingham.

Birmingham: 33.5207°N, Dallas: 32.7767°N, so Dallas is south of Birmingham.

Now Lake Martin: around 32.6°N, which is south of Dallas? 32.6 < 32.78, so yes, south.

But with the northern part at 32.83, which is greater than 32.78.

32.83 > 32.78, so 32.83N is north of 32.78N.

Specifically, 32.831°N vs 32.7791°N, difference about 0.0519 degrees, approximately 3.58 miles north.

So the very northern tip of Lake Martin is about 3.6 miles north of the Dal-Tex Building latitude.

The southern tip is at 32.522°N, which is 32.7791 - 32.522 = 0.2571 degrees south, about 17.7 miles south.

The centroid at 32.6765°N is 32.7791 - 32.6765 = 0.1026 degrees south, about 7.1 miles south.

So, for most purposes, Lake Martin is south of Dal-Tex, but strictly speaking, not entirely.

However, in the context of this question, since it's a lake and we're comparing points, I think we can say it is located south, based on the central point.

Perhaps the question expects a simple comparison.

Another way: let's see the cities.

Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, TX.

Lake Martin is in Alabama, and Alabama is southeast of Texas, but specifically for latitude.

I can think of the state locations.

Texas extends from about 25.8°N to 36.5°N, Alabama from about 30.2°N to 35°N.

Dallas is at 32.78°N, which is similar to central Alabama.

Montgomery, AL is at 32.3796°N, which is south of Dallas 32.78N.

Lake Martin is near Montgomery? Not really, Montgomery is south, Lake Martin is north of Montgomery.

Montgomery: 32.3796°N, Lake Martin southern end 32.522N, northern 32.831N, so Lake Martin is north of Montgomery.

Dallas 32.78N, Montgomery 32.38N, so Montgomery is south of Dallas.

Lake Martin at 32.68N avg is between them.

But 32.68 < 32.78, so south.

I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let's use a specific point for Lake Martin. Since it's a lake, we can use the dam or a park.

For example, Wind Creek State Park on Lake Martin is at 32.522°N, which is south of Dal-Tex.

But the lake includes areas north.

However, when we say "Lake Martin is located", it might refer to the general area.

In many contexts, it is considered south.

I can calculate the distance.

But I think for the purpose of this exercise, since the latitude of Lake Martin is generally lower, it is south.

Let's look for the official or common latitude.

Upon second thought, in geographical terms, if the southernmost point is south, but the northernmost is north, it's not strictly south.

But for this question, I think the answer is yes, it is south.

Perhaps I should just go with the numbers.

Dal-Tex: 32.7791°N

Lake Martin (centroid): approximately 32.65°N to 32.7°N

32.65 < 32.7791, so south.

I think it's safe to say yes.

But let's confirm with a map.

I recall that from Dallas to Alabama, you go east and slightly south, but Alabama is at similar latitudes.

For example, Atlanta, GA is at 33.7490°N, north of Dallas.

Lake Martin is south of Atlanta.

Dallas is at 32.78N, Atlanta at 33.75N, so Dallas is south of Atlanta.

Lake Martin at 32.7N is also south of Atlanta, but relative to Dallas, 32.7N vs 32.78N, 32.7 is south.

Difference is small, but yes.

Final decision: based on coordinates, Lake Martin has a lower latitude, so it is south of Dal-Tex Building.

Answer should be yes.

The question is "located south of", and since the primary point is south, I think yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine if Lake Martin, AL is south of the Dal-Tex Building, TX, I need to compare their latitudes. "South" is defined by a lower latitude (i.e., a smaller numerical value in degrees north). Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the coordinates of Lake Martin, AL**:
   - Lake Martin is a large reservoir in Alabama, spanning multiple counties. For geographical comparisons, we use a central or representative point to simplify. The Martin Dam, a key landmark on the lake, has coordinates approximately 32.618°N, 85.920°W.
   - Alternatively, the centroid (average center point) of Lake Martin can be used, which is approximately 32.676°N (based on the lake's latitude range from about 32.522°N at the southern end to 32.831°N at the northern end).
   - For accuracy, I'll use the centroid latitude: **32.676°N**.

2. **Identify the coordinates of the Dal-Tex Building, TX**:
   - The Dal-Tex Building is located at 501 Elm Street, Dallas, Texas. Its coordinates are well-documented as approximately **32.779°N, 96.808°W**.
   - This latitude (32.779°N) is the reference point for comparison.

3. **Compare the latitudes**:
   - Lake Martin centroid latitude: 32.676°N
   - Dal-Tex Building latitude: 32.779°N
   - Since 32.676°N is less than 32.779°N, Lake Martin has a lower latitude than the Dal-Tex Building.
   - A lower latitude means a location is farther south. Therefore, Lake Martin, AL is south of the Dal-Tex Building, TX.

4. **Consider the lake's extent for thoroughness**:
   - Lake Martin spans a latitude range (32.522°N to 32.831°N), so not all parts of the lake are south of the Dal-Tex Building (e.g., the northern end at ~32.831°N is slightly north of 32.779°N).
   - However, the centroid (32.676°N) and the majority of the lake's area are south of 32.779°N. In geographical contexts, when asking if a place is "located south" of another, we typically refer to the general or central location unless specified otherwise. Thus, Lake Martin is considered south of the Dal-Tex Building.

**Final Answer**: Yes
