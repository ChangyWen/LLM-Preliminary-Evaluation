*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are comparing the release dates of two books:
1. "Summertime" by J. M. Coetzee
2. "Catching Fire" by Suzanne Collins

First, let's recall the publication years of these books:

- "Summertime" by J. M. Coetzee: This book was published in 2009. It is the third book in Coetzee's fictionalized memoir series, following "Boyhood" and "Youth".

- "Catching Fire" by Suzanne Collins: This is the second book in "The Hunger Games" trilogy. It was published in 2009 as well.

So both books were published in 2009. We need to know the exact months to determine which one was released later.

Checking the exact publication dates:

- "Summertime": It was published on **October 1, 2009** in the United Kingdom by Harvill Secker. In the United States, it was published by Viking Press on **December 24, 2009**. However, the original publication date is typically considered the first release. So the UK release in October 2009 is the first publication.

- "Catching Fire": It was published by Scholastic on **September 1, 2009** in the United States.

Now, comparing the dates:

- "Catching Fire": September 1, 2009
- "Summertime": October 1, 2009 (UK) and December 24, 2009 (US). The first publication is the UK one: October 1, 2009.

Therefore, "Summertime" was released in October 2009, which is after September 2009.

So, "Summertime" was released later than "Catching Fire".

Answer: Yes.
