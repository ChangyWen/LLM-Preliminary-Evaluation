*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are comparing the death years of Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy and William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey.

First, let's recall the known historical dates:

Agnes of Aquitaine (also known as Agnes of Poitou) was the daughter of William IX, Duke of Aquitaine and Philippa of Toulouse. She married Peter I of Savoy. She died in 1078.

William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, was a Norman nobleman who fought at the Battle of Hastings. He was born around the 1050s and died in 1088.

Now, we compare:

- Agnes of Aquitaine died in 1078.
- William de Warenne died in 1088.

Therefore, William de Warenne died later than Agnes of Aquitaine? Actually, no: Agnes died in 1078 and William in 1088, so William died after Agnes.

But wait, let me double-check the dates for Agnes:

Agnes of Aquitaine (c. 1025 â€“ 1078) was the wife of Peter I, Count of Savoy. She died in 1078.

William de Warenne (died 1088) was created the first Earl of Surrey by William the Conqueror.

So, 1078 is before 1088. Therefore, Agnes died earlier.

The question: Did Agnes die later than William? 

Answer: No, because 1078 (Agnes) is before 1088 (William). So Agnes died earlier.

Final answer: No.

But let's write it clearly:

Agnes of Aquitaine died in 1078.
William de Warenne died in 1088.

Therefore, Agnes died 10 years before William.

So the answer to the question "Did Agnes of Aquitaine die later than William de Warenne?" is No.

Final Answer: No.
