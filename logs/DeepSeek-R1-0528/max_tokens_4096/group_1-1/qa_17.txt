*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Yamhill County, Oregon, is north of Clackamas County, Oregon. Both are counties in Oregon, so I should recall their locations within the state.

I know that Oregon is divided into several counties. Let me think about the general geography. Oregon is on the west coast of the United States, with the Pacific Ocean to the west. Major cities include Portland, which is in Multnomah County, and Salem, which is the state capital in Marion County.

Now, Clackamas County: I believe it's located in the northwestern part of Oregon, south of Multnomah County, where Portland is. Clackamas County is part of the Portland metropolitan area. It includes areas like Oregon City, which is south of Portland.

Yamhill County: I think Yamhill County is also in northwestern Oregon, west of the Willamette Valley. It includes cities like McMinnville and Newberg. I recall that Yamhill County is southwest of Portland.

To compare their positions, I should think about their relative latitudes. Latitude measures how far north or south a place is.

I remember that Portland is at about 45.5 degrees north latitude. Since Clackamas County is directly south of Portland, it might be slightly south of that, but still around 45 degrees.

Yamhill County: I think it's west of Portland, but is it north or south of Clackamas County?

Let me visualize a map. If I imagine Portland in the north, with the Columbia River to the north, then moving south, you have Multnomah County (Portland), then Clackamas County to the southeast or south? Wait, Clackamas is directly south of Multnomah.

Actually, looking at the counties:

- Multnomah County is the northernmost in the metro area, with Portland.

- South of Multnomah is Clackamas County.

- West of Multnomah is Washington County, which includes Hillsboro.

- And southwest of that is Yamhill County.

Yamhill County is adjacent to Washington County on the west and south, I think.

I should consider the coordinates.

Since I don't have a map in front of me, I can think about major cities.

For example, Oregon City is the county seat of Clackamas County. Oregon City is approximately at 45.36°N latitude.

McMinnville is the county seat of Yamhill County. McMinnville is at about 45.21°N latitude.

Is that right? Let me confirm my memory.

I could reason based on the Willamette River. The Willamette River flows north through the valley. Portland is at the confluence with the Columbia River, so areas south are upstream.

Salem is south of Portland, at about 44.9°N, and it's in Marion County.

Yamhill County is west of Marion County, so it should be around the same latitude or slightly north.

Marion County has Salem at 44.94°N. Yamhill County has McMinnville at 45.21°N? I think I have a number in mind, but let's be precise.

Since this is a reasoning process, I should use available knowledge.

I recall that Yamhill County is north of Polk County and west of Marion County. Clackamas County is east of Marion County and north of Linn County.

But for latitude, let's compare the county seats.

Clackamas County seat: Oregon City. Latitude: approximately 45.357°N.

Yamhill County seat: McMinnville. Latitude: approximately 45.210°N.

45.210 is less than 45.357, so McMinnville is south of Oregon City.

Latitude decreases as you go south, so lower latitude means further south.

45.210°N vs. 45.357°N: 45.210 is smaller, so it's south of 45.357.

Therefore, McMinnville (Yamhill) is south of Oregon City (Clackamas).

But is the county seat representative? Counties can be large, so I should consider the overall position.

Generally, county seats are centrally located, but for this purpose, it should be fine.

To be thorough, let's think about the county boundaries.

I know that Yamhill County is directly west of Marion County, and Marion County is south of Clackamas County.

Clackamas County is directly south of Multnomah County and east of Washington County.

Yamhill County is south of Washington County and west of Marion County.

So, relative to Clackamas, which is southeast of Portland, Yamhill is southwest.

Therefore, Yamhill should be west and slightly south of Clackamas.

I can think about driving directions. From Portland to McMinnville, you go west on Highway 26 or something, which is roughly southwest.

From Portland to Oregon City, you go south on I-205, directly south.

So Oregon City is directly south, while McMinnville is southwest, meaning it has a lower latitude.

Another point: the northern border of Clackamas County is with Multnomah County, which is at about 45.5°N or so.

The northern border of Yamhill County is with Washington County. Washington County's northern border is with Columbia County, but the latitude might be similar.

For example, Hillsboro in Washington County is at about 45.52°N, which is north of Portland? No, Portland is 45.52°N, Hillsboro is west and similar latitude.

Portland: 45.515°N

Hillsboro: 45.519°N, almost same.

McMinnville: 45.210°N, which is about 0.3 degrees south, which is significant.

Oregon City: 45.357°N

So Oregon City at 45.357°N, McMinnville at 45.210°N, so McMinnville is south of Oregon City.

Therefore, Yamhill County is south of Clackamas County.

The question is: is Yamhill County north of Clackamas? Based on this, no.

But let's confirm the county positions.

I can think about the center points or approximate centroids.

According to general knowledge, Clackamas County is positioned such that its northern part is at higher latitude than Yamhill's northern part.

For instance, the northern border of Clackamas is around 45.5°N, shared with Multnomah.

The northern border of Yamhill is with Washington County, which at that point is around 45.4°N or something? Washington County extends north, but Yamhill is south.

Washington County's southern part borders Yamhill.

Perhaps I should look for the latitude range.

But I think the county seat comparison is sufficient.

Another way: Salem is at 44.93°N in Marion County. Marion County is south of Clackamas and east of Yamhill.

Since Marion is south of Clackamas, and Yamhill is west of Marion, but at similar latitude to Marion or slightly north.

Salem 44.93°N, McMinnville 45.21°N, so McMinnville is north of Salem.

Oregon City 45.36°N, which is north of both.

So Oregon City > McMinnville in latitude, meaning Oregon City is north of McMinnville.

Therefore, Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County.

So Yamhill County is south of Clackamas County.

Thus, Yamhill County is not north of Clackamas County; it's south.

The question is: "Is Yamhill County, OR located north of Clackamas County, OR?"

Based on this, no.

But let me make sure there's no mistake.

Perhaps I have the latitudes wrong.

I can reason without specific numbers.

Oregon counties from north to south: along the west, Columbia, Washington, then Yamhill, then Polk, etc.

Columbia County is north, then Washington, then Yamhill is south of Washington.

To the east, Multnomah, then Clackamas, then Marion, etc.

So Clackamas is east and slightly north compared to Yamhill.

For example, the city of Newberg is in Yamhill County, at 45.30°N, which is still south of Oregon City's 45.36°N.

45.30 vs 45.36, yes, 45.30 is south.

Even Newberg, which is closer, is south.

Yamhill County's northernmost point might be around 45.4°N or so, but Clackamas goes up to 45.5°N.

Similarly, Yamhill's southern part is around 45.0°N or less.

But clearly, the centroid is lower.

Therefore, Yamhill County is not north of Clackamas County; it is south of it.

So the answer should be no.

The question asks for step-by-step reasoning and final answer.

Final answer: No.

But let's box it.

Perhaps I should state it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

To determine if Yamhill County, Oregon, is located north of Clackamas County, Oregon, I will compare their geographic positions using latitude and relative location within the state. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether Yamhill County is north of Clackamas County. This depends on their latitudes—specifically, if the average or key points in Yamhill County have higher latitudes than those in Clackamas County. Latitude increases as you move north.

2. **Identify Key Reference Points**: County seats are often used as representative points for comparing county locations, as they are centrally located and easy to reference. The county seat of Clackamas County is Oregon City, and the county seat of Yamhill County is McMinnville.

3. **Gather Latitude Data**:
   - Oregon City, Clackamas County: Approximately 45.357°N latitude.
   - McMinnville, Yamhill County: Approximately 45.210°N latitude.

4. **Compare Latitudes**:
   - 45.210°N (McMinnville) is less than 45.357°N (Oregon City).
   - Since latitude decreases as you move south, McMinnville (Yamhill County) is south of Oregon City (Clackamas County).

5. **Consider County Boundaries**:
   - Clackamas County is located in the northwestern part of Oregon, directly south of Multnomah County (which contains Portland). Its northern border is at a higher latitude (around 45.5°N near the Columbia River) than any part of Yamhill County.
   - Yamhill County is also in northwestern Oregon but is positioned southwest of Clackamas County, sharing a border with Washington County to the north and Marion County to the east. Yamhill County's northern border is generally around 45.4°N, while its southern areas dip below 45.0°N.
   - Overall, Clackamas County's centroid (average position) is at a higher latitude than Yamhill County's centroid.

6. **Regional Context**:
   - Moving from north to south in western Oregon:
     - Columbia County (northernmost) > Multnomah County > Clackamas County (east) and Washington County (west) > then Yamhill County (south of Washington County).
   - Clackamas County is east of the Willamette River and directly south of Portland, while Yamhill County is west of the Willamette River and southwest of Portland. This places Yamhill County generally west and south of Clackamas County.
   - For example, driving from Portland to Oregon City (Clackamas County) heads directly south, while driving from Portland to McMinnville (Yamhill County) heads southwest, confirming the lower latitude of Yamhill County.

7. **Conclusion from Data**: Based on the latitude comparison of county seats and the overall geographic relationship, Yamhill County is not north of Clackamas County; it is south of it. Therefore, the answer to the question is "No."

**Final Answer: No**
