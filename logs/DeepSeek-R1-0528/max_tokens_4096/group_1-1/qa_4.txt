*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan located south of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Williamsburg and Hillman Houses are both in New York City, but I need to clarify their locations. Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" – is that a mistake? Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Similarly, Hillman Houses is a public housing complex, and I think it's in Manhattan.

Let me confirm the locations:

- Williamsburg: This is a neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn, New York City. It's not in Manhattan.

- Hillman Houses: I believe this refers to the Lillian Wald Houses or something similar? I think it's the Jacob Riis Houses or perhaps it's in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Upon second thought, Hillman Houses is a public housing development located in the Two Bridges area on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

The question specifically says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" and "HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan". But Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan; it's in Brooklyn. This might be a typo or misunderstanding. Perhaps the user meant Williamsburg in Brooklyn, but the question labels it as Manhattan, which is incorrect.

Maybe there's a place called Williamsburg within Manhattan? I don't think so. Manhattan has neighborhoods like Williamsburg Bridge, but that's a bridge, not a neighborhood. Williamsburg Bridge connects Manhattan to Brooklyn, specifically to Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

I think the user might be confused. Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, and Hillman Houses is in Manhattan.

But the question is asking about their relative positions: is Williamsburg south of Hillman Houses?

Since Williamsburg is in Brooklyn and Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, I need to think about the geography of New York City.

Manhattan is an island, and Brooklyn is on the other side of the East River. The southern tip of Manhattan is Downtown, like Battery Park, and it goes north to Uptown, like Harlem.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is directly east of Lower Manhattan, across the East River.

Hillman Houses is located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which is in the southern part of Manhattan.

Let me get specific coordinates or general directions.

First, Hillman Houses: I believe it's at approximately 40.712°N, 73.980°W, which is on the Lower East Side, south of East Houston Street, near the Manhattan Bridge.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is around 40.714°N, 73.957°W, which is just east of the East River, opposite the Lower East Side.

Now, comparing latitudes:

- Hillman Houses latitude: about 40.712°N

- Williamsburg, Brooklyn latitude: about 40.714°N

Latitude measures north-south position; higher latitude means further north.

So, Williamsburg at 40.714°N is slightly north of Hillman Houses at 40.712°N.

Therefore, Williamsburg is north of Hillman Houses, not south.

But the question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" – but Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan. I think this is a key point.

Perhaps the user is referring to the Williamsburg Bridge or something else, but it says "WILLIAMSBURG", which is the neighborhood.

Maybe in some contexts, people might say "Williamsburg, Manhattan" by mistake, but it's not accurate.

Another thought: there is a Williamsburg Houses in Manhattan? No, Williamsburg Houses is a public housing project in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Let me double-check:

- Williamsburg: neighborhood in Brooklyn.

- Williamsburg Houses: located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

- Hillman Houses: located in Lower East Side, Manhattan.

So, Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, Williamsburg is in Brooklyn.

Now, for the south comparison:

Manhattan is oriented with Downtown (south) and Uptown (north). Lower East Side is in southern Manhattan.

Brooklyn is to the east and south of Manhattan. Specifically, Williamsburg is at a similar latitude to Lower Manhattan but often considered slightly north or south depending on the exact point.

From the latitudes:

Lower East Side, Manhattan: around 40.712°N

Williamsburg, Brooklyn: around 40.714°N

Since 40.714 > 40.712, Williamsburg is north of Hillman Houses.

To be precise, let's take the coordinates of Hillman Houses. I think it's at Rutgers Slip, near Cherry Street.

Hillman Houses address: 305 Cherry St, New York, NY 10002.

Latitude: 40.7102° N, Longitude: 73.9824° W

Williamsburg, Brooklyn: let's take a central point, say Bedford Avenue and North 7th Street.

Latitude: 40.7143° N, Longitude: 73.9615° W

Now, comparing:

Hillman Houses latitude: 40.7102° N

Williamsburg latitude: 40.7143° N

Difference: 40.7143 - 40.7102 = 0.0041 degrees north.

Since latitude increases north, Williamsburg is about 0.0041 degrees north of Hillman Houses.

In terms of distance, one degree of latitude is about 111 km, so 0.0041 degrees is about 0.45 km north, which is roughly 1/4 mile north.

Therefore, Williamsburg is north of Hillman Houses.

But is Williamsburg south? No, it's north.

The question is about "south of", so based on this, Williamsburg is not south; it's slightly north.

Moreover, since Williamsburg is in Brooklyn and Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, and Brooklyn is generally south of Manhattan except that the northern parts of Brooklyn are at similar latitudes to southern Manhattan.

Specifically, Williamsburg is opposite the Lower East Side, which is south, so it's at the same level or slightly north.

But from the coordinates, Williamsburg latitude is higher, so north.

Perhaps I should consider the relative position.

Another way: Manhattan is roughly aligned north-south, tilted slightly, but generally, south is downtown.

Hillman Houses is in Lower Manhattan, which is south.

Williamsburg is across the river, and since the East River flows south, but geographically, Williamsburg is to the east and slightly north.

For example, the southern tip of Manhattan is around 40.70°N, and Williamsburg starts around 40.71°N, so yes.

Therefore, Williamsburg is not south of Hillman Houses; it's slightly north.

But the question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" – which might imply that there is a Williamsburg in Manhattan, but I don't think there is. I think it's a mistake.

Perhaps the user means the Williamsburg neighborhood, but labeled as Manhattan by error.

In any case, based on actual geography, Williamsburg is in Brooklyn and is not south of Hillman Houses in Manhattan.

To answer directly: no, Williamsburg is not south of Hillman Houses.

Final answer should be no.

But let's confirm if Hillman Houses is indeed in Manhattan.

Yes, Hillman Houses is a public housing development at 305 Cherry Street, New York, NY 10002, which is Manhattan.

Williamsburg is in Brooklyn.

And as per coordinates, Williamsburg is north.

Perhaps in terms of street grids, but I think latitude is fine.

Another point: sometimes people refer to directions based on the river or something, but generally, for cardinal directions, latitude is key.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify locations: Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Hillman Houses is in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

2. Since Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, but the question phrases it as "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan", I must assume it refers to the Brooklyn neighborhood or address the location as given. However, geographically, it's in Brooklyn.

3. Find approximate coordinates:

- Hillman Houses, Manhattan: latitude ~40.7102°N

- Williamsburg, Brooklyn: latitude ~40.7143°N

4. Compare latitudes: 40.7143°N > 40.7102°N, so Williamsburg is north of Hillman Houses.

5. Therefore, Williamsburg is not south of Hillman Houses; it is slightly north.

6. Hence, the answer is no.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the Locations**:
   - **Williamsburg**: This is primarily a neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn, New York City. It is not located in Manhattan. The phrase "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" appears to be a misstatement, as there is no neighborhood or significant area called Williamsburg within Manhattan. Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is situated on the eastern side of the East River, opposite Manhattan's Lower East Side.
   - **Hillman Houses**: This is a public housing complex located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, specifically at 305 Cherry Street, New York, NY 10002. It is part of Manhattan and is situated near the Manhattan Bridge and the East River.

2. **Clarify Geographic Context**:
   - Since Williamsburg is in Brooklyn and Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, we need to compare their relative positions using geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) to determine if one is south of the other.
   - Latitude values increase as you move north and decrease as you move south. Therefore, a lower latitude indicates a more southerly position.

3. **Obtain Coordinates**:
   - **Hillman Houses, Manhattan**: 
     - Approximate coordinates: 40.7102° N, 73.9824° W (based on its address at 305 Cherry Street).
   - **Williamsburg, Brooklyn**: 
     - Approximate coordinates: 40.7143° N, 73.9615° W (using a central point in Williamsburg, such as Bedford Avenue and North 7th Street, for reference).

4. **Compare Latitudes**:
   - Hillman Houses latitude: 40.7102° N
   - Williamsburg latitude: 40.7143° N
   - Since 40.7143° N is greater than 40.7102° N, Williamsburg is north of Hillman Houses.
   - The difference in latitude is about 0.0041 degrees, which translates to approximately 0.45 kilometers (or 0.28 miles) north of Hillman Houses. This confirms that Williamsburg is not south of Hillman Houses.

5. **Consider Directional Relationship**:
   - Hillman Houses is in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which is a southern area of Manhattan (south of 14th Street).
   - Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is directly east of the Lower East Side but at a slightly higher latitude, placing it marginally north of Hillman Houses geographically.
   - Brooklyn as a whole is generally south of parts of Manhattan, but Williamsburg specifically aligns with or is slightly north of Lower Manhattan due to the orientation of the East River and the street grid.

6. **Address the "Manhattan" Label for Williamsburg**:
   - The query mentions "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," but this is inaccurate. Williamsburg is not part of Manhattan; it is in Brooklyn. If this was intended to refer to a different location (e.g., the Williamsburg Bridge, which connects Manhattan and Brooklyn), the bridge's Manhattan entrance is near the Lower East Side, but it is not a neighborhood. Based on standard geographic understanding, "Williamsburg" refers to the Brooklyn neighborhood, and the coordinates support that it is not south of Hillman Houses.

**Final Answer**: No. Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is not south of Hillman Houses, Manhattan; it is slightly north.
