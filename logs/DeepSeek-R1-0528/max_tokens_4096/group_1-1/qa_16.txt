*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is The Ort Institute, IL located west of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a yes or no answer.

I need to find the locations of both places. "IL" stands for Illinois, and "WI" stands for Wisconsin. So, The Ort Institute is in Illinois, and the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

I should look up the exact locations or at least the cities they're in. I don't have direct access to the internet, but I can use general knowledge or logical reasoning based on geography.

Let me recall where Sheboygan is. Sheboygan is a city in Wisconsin, located on the western shore of Lake Michigan. That means it's on the eastern side of Wisconsin.

Now, for The Ort Institute in Illinois. I'm not sure what "The Ort Institute" is. It might be a specific institution. Upon thinking, I believe "Ort" refers to ORT, which is a global educational network. But is there a specific Ort Institute in Illinois? I think there might be ORT campuses or affiliates, but I need to be precise.

Perhaps "The Ort Institute" is a reference to a place in Illinois. Let me assume it's in Chicago or somewhere, as Illinois is a large state, but Chicago is the major city.

To compare directions, I need longitude, because east-west is determined by longitude; west has lower longitude if we're in the northern hemisphere.

Since both are in the US, I can think in terms of relative positions.

First, let's establish the location of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan. Sheboygan, WI. Sheboygan is in eastern Wisconsin, on Lake Michigan. Its approximate coordinates are around 43.75° N, 87.71° W. I should use decimal degrees for ease.

Similarly, for Illinois, I need to know where The Ort Institute is. But what is The Ort Institute? I think there might be a misunderstanding. ORT is an organization, but it might not have an "Institute" specifically named that in Illinois. Perhaps it's a typo or misnomer.

Upon second thought, I recall that in Skokie, Illinois, there is an ORT Technical Institute. I think it's called Illinois Institute of Technology ORT or something. Let me clarify.

Actually, I believe there is a World ORT institute, but for the US, ORT America is based in New York, but they have programs in various places. But specifically in Illinois, I think there was a ORT Technical Institute in Skokie, which is near Chicago.

I think the ORT Technical Institute in Skokie, IL, is a real place. Skokie is a suburb of Chicago.

So, let's assume The Ort Institute refers to that, in Skokie, Illinois.

Now, Skokie, IL: approximately 42.03° N, 87.74° W.

Sheboygan, WI: approximately 43.75° N, 87.71° W.

Longitude: Sheboygan is at about 87.71° W, and Skokie is at 87.74° W.

Longitude measures how far west a location is from the Prime Meridian. A higher number means farther west, since it's west longitude.

For example, 87.74° W is slightly west of 87.71° W because 87.74 is greater than 87.71.

In terms of west, a larger longitude value means more west.

Standard: Longitude increases as you go west from the Prime Meridian.

So, for two points, the one with the higher longitude value is farther west.

Sheboygan, WI: 87.71° W

Skokie, IL: 87.74° W

87.74 is greater than 87.71, so Skokie has a higher longitude, meaning it is farther west.

Therefore, Skokie, IL is west of Sheboygan, WI.

But is that correct? Let's think geographically.

Sheboygan is on the western shore of Lake Michigan, so it's quite far east in Wisconsin.

Skokie is near Chicago, which is also on Lake Michigan, but Chicago is south of Sheboygan.

Chicago, IL is at about 41.88° N, 87.63° W. Skokie is nearby, say 42.03° N, 87.74° W.

Sheboygan is at 43.75° N, 87.71° W.

Comparing longitudes:

Sheboygan: 87.71° W

Skokie: 87.74° W

87.74 > 87.71, so Skokie has a higher longitude, which means it is west of Sheboygan.

But let's confirm the values.

I should double-check the coordinates.

Actual coordinates:

- Sheboygan, WI: Latitude 43.7508° N, Longitude 87.7145° W (approximately)

- Skokie, IL: Latitude 42.0324° N, Longitude 87.7416° W (approximately)

Longitude: Sheboygan ~87.71° W, Skokie ~87.74° W.

87.74 is greater than 87.71, so Skokie is about 0.03 degrees west of Sheboygan.

One degree of longitude is about 85 km at this latitude, so 0.03 degrees is about 2.55 km, so yes, Skokie is slightly west.

But is it significantly west? The question is whether it is west, not how far.

Since 87.74 > 87.71, Skokie is west of Sheboygan.

But Sheboygan is in Wisconsin, and Skokie is in Illinois, which is south and slightly west.

Now, the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, so that's clear.

The Ort Institute: I assumed it's in Skokie, IL. Is that correct?

I need to confirm what "The Ort Institute" is.

Upon thinking, ORT has an institute in Skokie. For example, the ORT Technical Institute was there, but I think it might be closed now or something. But for geographical purposes, we can take it as located in Skokie.

Perhaps there is another Ort Institute in Illinois.

But I think for this context, it's reasonable.

Another thought: maybe "Ort" is a misspelling or refers to something else, but I believe it's ORT.

Perhaps it's the Illinois Institute of Technology, but that's different.

I think ORT Technical Institute is the one.

To be thorough, let's see if there's a place called "The Ort Institute" in Illinois.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll proceed with Skokie as the location.

So, Skokie, IL longitude: 87.74° W

Sheboygan, WI longitude: 87.71° W

Therefore, Skokie is west of Sheboygan because 87.74 > 87.71.

Thus, The Ort Institute in Illinois is west of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan in Wisconsin.

But the question is: "Is The Ort Institute, IL located west of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI?"

Based on coordinates, yes.

But let's make sure about the university location. University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, WI, so same coordinates.

Now, is there any trick? Sheboygan is at 87.71° W, and Chicago is at 87.63° W, which is less, meaning Chicago is east of Sheboygan? Let's see.

Chicago, IL: approximately 41.88° N, 87.63° W

87.63° W compared to Sheboygan 87.71° W.

87.63 < 87.71, so Chicago has lower longitude, meaning it is east of Sheboygan.

But that can't be right geographically because Sheboygan is north of Chicago, but in terms of east-west?

Let's think: both on Lake Michigan. Chicago is south, Sheboygan is north, but Lake Michigan runs north-south.

The longitude: at higher latitudes, the distance per degree longitude is less, but the values should still indicate east-west.

Prime Meridian is 0, increasing west to 180.

So for two points, higher longitude is farther west.

Chicago: 87.63° W

Sheboygan: 87.71° W

87.71 > 87.63, so Sheboygan has higher longitude, meaning it is west of Chicago.

Is that correct?

Geographically: Chicago is around 87.63° W, Sheboygan is about 87.71° W. Since 87.71 > 87.63, Sheboygan is farther west.

But intuitively, looking at a map, Chicago is directly south of Sheboygan along the lake, but slightly to the east or west?

Let's take a reference. Milwaukee is between them. Milwaukee, WI: approximately 43.04° N, 87.91° W? No.

Milwaukee: 43.04° N, 87.91° W? I think it's around 87.97 W or something.

Standard coordinates:

- Chicago, IL: 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W

- Milwaukee, WI: 43.0389° N, 87.9065° W

- Sheboygan, WI: 43.7508° N, 87.7145° W

Sheboygan longitude: 87.7145° W

Milwaukee: 87.9065° W

87.9065 > 87.7145, so Milwaukee is west of Sheboygan? But Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee, and Milwaukee is west of Lake Michigan while Sheboygan is more east? I'm confusing myself.

Let's plot:

Lake Michigan shoreline: from north to south, the longitude decreases slightly as you go south because the lake curves.

For example:

- Green Bay, WI: 44.5192° N, 88.0198° W (but that's not on lake, better to use coastal cities)

- Sheboygan: 43.75° N, 87.71° W

- Milwaukee: 43.04° N, 87.91° W

87.91 W for Milwaukee, 87.71 W for Sheboygan. 87.91 > 87.71, so Milwaukee is west of Sheboygan, which is correct because Sheboygan is more east on the lake.

Then Chicago: 41.88° N, 87.63° W

87.63 W < 87.71 W, so Chicago has lower longitude than Sheboygan, meaning Chicago is east of Sheboygan.

But geographically, from Sheboygan to Chicago, you go south, and slightly east because the lake curves.

Distance: Sheboygan to Chicago is about 120 miles south, but longitude difference: 87.71 to 87.63 is 0.08 degrees, which at that latitude is about 6.8 km west to east? Let's calculate.

Average latitude around 43N, one degree longitude is about 82 km (since at equator 111km, decreases with cosine latitude).

Cos(43)≈0.73, so 111*0.73≈81 km per degree.

So 0.08 degrees longitude difference: 0.08 * 81 ≈ 6.48 km.

So Sheboygan at 87.71W, Chicago at 87.63W, so Chicago is about 6.5 km east of Sheboygan in terms of longitude, but since it's south, the straight line direction is southeast.

But for east-west comparison, Chicago is slightly east of Sheboygan.

Now back to Skokie, IL: which is near Chicago, at 42.03° N, 87.74° W

87.74 W

Sheboygan: 87.71 W

87.74 > 87.71, so Skokie is west of Sheboygan.

Difference: 87.74 - 87.71 = 0.03 degrees, about 0.03*81≈2.43 km west.

So yes, The Ort Institute in Skokie, IL is west of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan in Sheboygan, WI.

Therefore, the answer should be yes.

But the question says "The Ort Institute, IL" – is it definitely in Skokie?

I think I should confirm the existence.

Upon recollection, ORT Technical Institute was located at 5440 Fargo Ave, Skokie, IL 60077.

Yes, and Skokie is part of the Chicago area.

So, coordinates as above.

Perhaps there is no such place, but for the sake of this question, I think it's fine.

Another thing: University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan – I think it's correct, it's a campus in Sheboygan.

So, based on this, Ort Institute, IL is west of UW-Sheboygan, WI.

But the question is: "located west of" – meaning is it to the west.

Since longitude is higher, yes.

To be thorough, let's see the latitude doesn't affect east-west, only longitude.

So, conclusion: Yes.

But in the beginning, I thought Sheboygan is east, but compared to Chicago area, it's slightly east, but Skokie has a bit higher longitude.

Perhaps I can think without coordinates.

Illinois is generally south and west of Wisconsin. Chicago is in northeast Illinois, and Sheboygan is in east Wisconsin. Since Wisconsin is north, but Illinois extends west.

Specifically, Sheboygan is on the eastern border of Wisconsin, while Skokie is near Chicago, which is at about the same longitude as eastern Wisconsin but slightly west in some parts.

From map: Chicago is roughly at 87.6 W, while the western part of Lake Michigan is around 87.7 to 88 W.

Sheboygan is at 87.71, Chicago at 87.63, so Chicago is east.

Skokie is at 87.74, which is west of 87.71.

Skokie is northwest of downtown Chicago, so it has a higher longitude.

Yes.

So, I think it's correct.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine if The Ort Institute in Illinois (IL) is located west of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan in Wisconsin (WI), I need to compare their geographic longitudes. Longitude measures how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian. A higher longitude value (in degrees west) means a location is farther west.

1. **Identify the Locations**:
   - **University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan (WI)**: This is located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Sheboygan is on the western shore of Lake Michigan in eastern Wisconsin.
     - Approximate coordinates: 43.7508° N, 87.7145° W (based on standard geographic data).
   - **The Ort Institute (IL)**: Based on available information, "The Ort Institute" refers to the ORT Technical Institute, which was located in Skokie, Illinois. Skokie is a suburb of Chicago in northeastern Illinois.
     - Approximate coordinates: 42.0324° N, 87.7416° W (based on standard geographic data for Skokie, IL, as the institute is no longer operational but the location is valid for this comparison).

2. **Compare Longitudes**:
   - University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan longitude: **87.7145° W**
   - The Ort Institute (Skokie, IL) longitude: **87.7416° W**
   - Since longitude values increase as you move west, a higher value indicates a location is farther west.
   - Comparison: 87.7416° W (The Ort Institute) vs. 87.7145° W (University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan).
   - Result: 87.7416 > 87.7145, meaning The Ort Institute has a higher longitude value and is therefore west of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan.

3. **Geographic Context**:
   - Sheboygan, WI, is in eastern Wisconsin, near Lake Michigan, at approximately 87.71° W.
   - Skokie, IL, is part of the Chicago metropolitan area and is slightly northwest of downtown Chicago (which is at approximately 87.6298° W). Skokie's longitude (87.74° W) places it west of Sheboygan due to the curvature of Lake Michigan and the regional geography.
   - The longitude difference is small (about 0.0271 degrees), which translates to roughly 2.2 km (1.4 miles) west at this latitude, but it is sufficient to confirm the directional relationship.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the longitude comparison, The Ort Institute in Skokie, IL, is west of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan in Sheboygan, WI.

**Final Answer: Yes**
