*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if The Ort Institute in Illinois is west of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan in Wisconsin. I should find the locations of both places and compare their longitudes, since longitude determines east-west position.

Starting with The Ort Institute in Illinois. I'm not immediately familiar with "The Ort Institute." It might be a misspelling or a less common name. I recall that there's an ORT organization, which is a global Jewish educational network. In Illinois, there might be a branch or institute. Perhaps it's referring to the Illinois Institute of Technology or something similar, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think.

Upon second thought, "Ort" might be a typo or shorthand for "ORT." I know that ORT America is part of World ORT, and they have offices in various places. I think there's an ORT office in Skokie, Illinois. But is it called "The Ort Institute"? I'm not sure. Let me confirm.

I should look for the exact location. Since I can't search the internet directly, I'll rely on general knowledge. Perhaps "Ort" refers to a specific place. Another idea: in Illinois, there's a city called North Chicago, but that's not "Ort." Maybe it's a college or something.

Perhaps it's a reference to the Illinois Institute of Technology, which is in Chicago. But that's IIT, not Ort. Let's consider if there's an ORT school. I recall that in Chicago, there might be an ORT technical school or something. But I'm not certain.

I think I need to assume that "The Ort Institute" is a real place in Illinois. For the sake of this problem, I'll treat it as located in Chicago, Illinois, since that's a major city and ORT has a presence there. World ORT has an office in Chicago, I believe. Let me proceed with that.

So, let's say The Ort Institute is in Chicago, IL.

Now, for the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI. That should be straightforward. University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is part of the UW Colleges, located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

Sheboygan is a city in Wisconsin, on the western shore of Lake Michigan.

Now, Chicago is in Illinois, also on the shore of Lake Michigan.

To compare if Chicago is west of Sheboygan, I need their longitudes.

First, let's find the longitude of Sheboygan, WI.

Sheboygan, WI, is approximately at latitude 43.75° N, longitude 87.71° W. I think that's close; let me confirm my memory. Actually, I should use approximate values.

Similarly, Chicago, IL, is at approximately 41.88° N, 87.63° W. Is that right?

Let me think: Chicago is around 87.6° W longitude. Sheboygan is north of Chicago, so it might have a similar longitude or slightly different.

Since both are on Lake Michigan, which runs north-south, their longitudes might be close, but Sheboygan is farther north, so it could be slightly east or west.

Lake Michigan is oriented north-south, so cities along the western shore should have similar longitudes, but as you go north, the longitude might change slightly because the lake curves a bit.

Let me recall specific coordinates.

Sheboygan, WI: I believe it's around 87.7° W longitude.

Chicago, IL: Downtown Chicago is about 87.62° W.

But let's be precise.

I can think in terms of time zones or relative positions.

Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee, and Milwaukee is about 87.9° W, I think. Milwaukee is around 87.97° W.

Let's list approximate longitudes:

- Chicago, IL: 87.63° W (for the Loop, but it varies)

- Milwaukee, WI: 87.97° W (approximately)

- Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee, so it should be a bit east or west? Actually, since the shore is curved, as you go north from Milwaukee, you might go slightly east.

Sheboygan, WI: Latitude 43.7508° N, Longitude 87.7145° W. (I think I have that right.)

Chicago, IL: Latitude 41.8781° N, Longitude 87.6298° W. (Approximately)

Now, comparing longitudes: 87.7145° W for Sheboygan and 87.6298° W for Chicago.

Longitude is measured in degrees west, so a higher number means farther west.

87.7145 is greater than 87.6298, so Sheboygan is west of Chicago?

That can't be right because Chicago is west of Lake Michigan, and Sheboygan is also on the western shore but north.

Let's think geographically.

Chicago is south along the lake, Sheboygan is north.

The western shore of Lake Michigan runs from north to south, but the longitude decreases as you go south because the meridian lines converge, but for east-west, at similar latitudes, but here latitudes are different.

Longitude is constant for north-south lines, but since the lake isn't perfectly straight, there might be slight variations.

Generally, cities on the western shore have longitudes that are similar but not identical.

From the numbers:

Sheboygan: 87.71° W

Chicago: 87.63° W

87.71 > 87.63, so Sheboygan has a higher west longitude, meaning it is farther west than Chicago.

But that seems counterintuitive because if you look at a map, Chicago is southwest of Sheboygan.

Let me visualize: Sheboygan is north, Chicago is south, but both are on the western side. Since the lake is diagonal, but actually, Lake Michigan is oriented such that from north to south, it's slightly tilted.

Sheboygan is at approximately 87.7° W, and Chicago at 87.6° W, so Sheboygan is about 0.1 degrees west of Chicago.

In terms of distance, one degree of longitude is about 85 km at 44° N, but let's not get into that.

Numerically, 87.71° W is west of 87.63° W because higher number in west longitude means more west.

For example, New York is around 74° W, which is east of Chicago at 87° W.

Yes, so a higher numerical value in degrees west means a location is farther west.

Therefore, Sheboygan at 87.71° W is west of Chicago at 87.63° W.

But is that accurate? Let me double-check the coordinates.

I think I have a mistake.

Chicago longitude: I believe it's 87.6298° W, which is about 87.63° W.

Sheboygan: I think I might be wrong. Let me think of another way.

Perhaps I should look at the positions relative to each other.

On a map, Sheboygan, WI is located at approximately 43.75°N, 87.71°W.

Chicago, IL is at 41.88°N, 87.63°W.

Now, 87.71W vs 87.63W: since both are west, 87.71 is greater than 87.63, so Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

But geographically, if you draw a line, Sheboygan is north, and Chicago is south, but due to the curvature, Sheboygan might be slightly east, but according to coordinates, it's not.

Let's think of Milwaukee, which is between them.

Milwaukee, WI: approximately 43.04°N, 87.91°W. 87.91W? I think I have an error.

I recall that Milwaukee is around 87.97°W, but let's confirm.

Standard coordinates:

- Chicago, IL: 41.88°N, 87.63°W

- Milwaukee, WI: 43.04°N, 87.91°W? That doesn't sound right.

I think Milwaukee is actually about 87.97°W, but let's be precise.

Upon second thought, I believe I have the longitudes mixed up.

Let me think: the prime meridian is 0, and as you go west, longitude increases from 0 to 180 west.

In the US, east coast is around 70-80°W, west coast around 120°W.

Chicago is around 87.6°W.

Now, Milwaukee is north of Chicago, and since the lake shore curves, Milwaukee is actually a bit west of Chicago? That doesn't sound right.

Let's use a reference. I know that Detroit is about 83°W, which is east of Chicago.

Chicago to Milwaukee: Milwaukee is north-northwest of Chicago, I think.

From memory, driving from Chicago to Milwaukee, it's north, but slightly west? No, it's mostly north with a little bit west.

Actually, Chicago is at approximately 87.6°W, and Milwaukee is at approximately 87.9°W or 88°W? I think I'm confusing it.

Let's look it up in my mind: I believe the longitude of downtown Milwaukee is 87.906°W, and Chicago is 87.624°W.

So, 87.906 > 87.624, so Milwaukee is west of Chicago.

But on a map, Chicago is south, Milwaukee is north, but Milwaukee is slightly west as well because the shore line is not straight.

Similarly, Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee.

Sheboygan, WI: I think it's around 87.71°W. Let's confirm.

Sheboygan latitude 43.75°N, longitude 87.71°W.

87.71W is less than Milwaukee's 87.91W, so Sheboygan is east of Milwaukee.

Compared to Chicago: Chicago 87.63W, Sheboygan 87.71W.

87.71 > 87.63, so Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

But let's calculate the difference.

87.71 - 87.63 = 0.08 degrees.

At the latitude, one degree of longitude is about 69 miles times cos(latitude), but roughly, at 43N, cos(43) is about 0.73, so 69 * 0.73 ≈ 50 miles per degree.

So 0.08 degrees is about 4 miles west.

So Sheboygan is approximately 4 miles west of Chicago in terms of longitude.

But since Chicago is south, it's not directly comparable, but for east-west, yes, Sheboygan is slightly west.

But the question is about The Ort Institute in IL being west of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan.

If The Ort Institute is in Chicago, then it is at 87.63W, and UW-Sheboygan is at 87.71W, so Chicago is east of Sheboygan because 87.63 < 87.71.

Longitude: smaller number means farther east if both are west.

So 87.63W is east of 87.71W.

Therefore, Chicago (87.63W) is east of Sheboygan (87.71W).

So The Ort Institute, if in Chicago, is east of UW-Sheboygan.

But is that correct? Let's make sure about the coordinates.

I think I need better data.

Perhaps "The Ort Institute" is not in Chicago. What is it exactly?

Earlier I assumed it's in Chicago, but maybe it's elsewhere in Illinois.

For example, if it's in Rockford or something, that might be different.

But I think ORT is in Chicago, so I'll stick with that.

Another thought: University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, WI, which is at approximately 87.7145°W.

Now, for Illinois, if The Ort Institute is in Chicago, it's at 87.6298°W.

87.6298 < 87.7145, so Chicago longitude is smaller, meaning it is east of Sheboygan.

Therefore, Chicago is east, not west.

So The Ort Institute would be east of UW-Sheboygan.

But the question is "west of", so if it's east, then it's not west.

But let's confirm the institute.

I am considering what "The Ort Institute" is. Upon reflection, I think it might be a reference to the ORT Technical Institute in Skokie, Illinois. Skokie is a suburb of Chicago.

Skokie, IL: approximately 42.03°N, 87.74°W.

Latitude 42.03, longitude 87.74W.

Now, UW-Sheboygan is at 43.75N, 87.71W.

Compare longitudes: Skokie 87.74W, Sheboygan 87.71W.

87.74 > 87.71, so Skokie is west of Sheboygan? 87.74 is greater, so yes, Skokie has higher west longitude, so it is farther west.

87.74W vs 87.71W: since both west, higher number means farther west, so 87.74 > 87.71, so Skokie is west of Sheboygan.

But let's see the difference: 87.74 - 87.71 = 0.03 degrees, about 2 miles at that latitude.

But directionally, Skokie is slightly west.

Sheboygan is at 87.71W, Skokie at 87.74W, so yes, Skokie is west.

But is ORT in Skokie? I think World ORT has an office in Skokie, or there was a school.

Perhaps it's the same.

But let's confirm UW-Sheboygan location.

University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan is located at 1 University Drive, Sheboygan, WI 53081.

Coordinates: approximately 43.7540°N, 87.7140°W.

Now, for The Ort Institute: I believe it refers to ORT America or a training center. Let's assume it's in Skokie, IL.

Skokie, IL, where ORT might be, is at about 42.0360°N, 87.7400°W.

Longitude: Skokie 87.74°W, Sheboygan 87.714°W.

87.74 > 87.714, so Skokie is west of Sheboygan.

Therefore, The Ort Institute (in Skokie, IL) is west of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan.

But the question is: "Is The Ort Institute, IL located west of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI?"

So, based on this, yes.

But earlier with Chicago, it was east, but with Skokie, it's west.

Skokie is a northern suburb, so its longitude is a bit higher.

Chicago downtown is 87.63W, Skokie is 87.74W, which is west of downtown Chicago.

And Sheboygan is 87.71W, which is between them numerically.

87.71W for Sheboygan, 87.74W for Skokie, so Skokie is slightly west.

To be thorough, let's see a map.

Since I can't, I'll rely on coordinates.

Another point: Rockford, IL is at about 89.09W, which is farther west, but I don't think Ort is there.

So, likely, Ort Institute is in the Chicago area, specifically Skokie.

Therefore, longitude 87.74W vs Sheboygan 87.71W, so Ort Institute is west.

But 87.74 is greater than 87.71, so yes.

Perhaps I should consider the exact location.

Maybe "The Ort Institute" is not well-known, but for the purpose of this problem, we can take it as given.

Another idea: perhaps it's a misspelling of "Art Institute," but that doesn't make sense because it says "Ort," and in context, it might be ORT.

The question says "The Ort Institute, IL" so I think it's ORT.

Based on common knowledge, ORT has a presence in Skokie.

Therefore, since Skokie, IL is at approximately 87.74°W and University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is at 87.71°W, Skokie is slightly west.

Thus, The Ort Institute is west of UW-Sheboygan.

So the answer should be yes.

But let's make sure about UW-Sheboygan's location.

Sheboygan, WI is on the shore, but the university might be slightly inland, but coordinates should be similar.

Similarly, Skokie is not on the lake.

But longitudes are comparable.

To be precise, the difference is small, but directionally, Skokie is west.

In terms of driving, Sheboygan is north, Skokie is south, but since the longitude is higher, it's west.

For example, from Sheboygan to Skokie, you would go south and a bit east, I think, but based on coordinates, since longitude decreases as you go east, but numerically.

Let's think: from Sheboygan at 87.71W to Skokie at 87.74W, going from 87.71 to 87.74 means increasing longitude, which is moving west, so Skokie is west of Sheboygan.

Yes.

Therefore, The Ort Institute in IL (Skokie) is west of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan.

So the answer is yes.

But the question is phrased as "located west of," which might imply directly west, but in geography, it's about longitude.

If a place has a higher west longitude, it is west of the other, even if not directly west.

Here, since latitudes are different, it's not directly west, but it is to the west.

For example, Los Angeles is west of Chicago, even though not at same latitude.

Similarly, here, Skokie is at lower latitude but slightly higher longitude, so it is southwest, but specifically, it is west because longitude is greater.

In cardinal directions, if longitude is higher and latitude is lower, it's southwest, but we say it is west if the longitude difference indicates west.

I think for this purpose, since the longitude is greater, we can say it is located west.

But let's see the exact comparison.

Longitude of Ort: 87.74W

Longitude of UW-Sheboygan: 87.71W

87.74 > 87.71, so Ort is west.

Latitude: Ort at 42.03N, UW at 43.75N, so Ort is south.

But for "west of," it should be fine.

Perhaps the institute is in Chicago proper.

But even if it were in Chicago, Chicago is at 87.63W, which is less than 87.71W, so Chicago is east.

But in Skokie, it's west.

And I think Ort is in Skokie.

To confirm, I recall that the ORT Technical Institute was in Skokie, but I think it might be closed
