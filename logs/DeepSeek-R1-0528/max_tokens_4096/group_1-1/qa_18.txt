*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine if Cambria County, Pennsylvania is west of Cattaraugus County, New York. I should start by recalling the locations of these counties.

Cambria County is in Pennsylvania. I know that Pennsylvania is to the west of New York state. But counties within states can have different longitudes, so I need to be more precise.

Cattaraugus County is in New York. New York state is on the east coast, and Pennsylvania is just to the west of New York. But Cattaraugus County is in the western part of New York, I think. Let me think about the geography.

I remember that Cattaraugus County is in the southwestern part of New York, near the Pennsylvania border. Similarly, Cambria County is in west-central Pennsylvania. So, they might be close to each other.

To compare their positions, I need to look at their longitudes. The county with the higher longitude (more west) would be further west, since longitude increases as you go west.

Longitude is measured in degrees west from the Prime Meridian. So, a higher numerical value in degrees west means further west. But sometimes it's given as negative degrees for west longitude, like -75° or something. I need to be careful with the sign.

In the United States, longitudes are west, so they are negative if we use the convention where east is positive. But for comparison, I can just use the absolute values or compare the numbers directly.

Let me try to find approximate longitudes for the counties.

First, Cattaraugus County, NY. I think it's near Buffalo, which is at around 78.8° W longitude. Buffalo is in Erie County, but Cattaraugus is adjacent to the south. Let me confirm.

I should recall that Cattaraugus County is in the western part of New York. The city of Salamanca or Olean might be in Cattaraugus County. Olean, NY is in Cattaraugus County, I believe.

What is the longitude of Olean, NY? I think it's around 78.43° W. Let me think.

Since I don't have a map, I need to reason based on general knowledge.

Pennsylvania and New York share a border. The border runs horizontally, so counties along the border might be at similar longitudes.

Cattaraugus County, NY borders Pennsylvania. Specifically, it borders McKean County, PA, I think.

Cambria County is not directly on the border; it's a bit east. Cambria County is where Johnstown is, I believe.

Johnstown, PA is in Cambria County. What is the longitude of Johnstown? I think it's around 78.92° W or something.

I need better estimates.

Let me think about major cities. Pittsburgh, PA is at about 80° W, and it's in western PA. Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh, so it should be less west, meaning smaller longitude number (but since it's west, higher numerical value if we ignore sign).

Longitude: as you go west, the number increases if it's in degrees west. For example, New York City is about 74° W, Pittsburgh is 80° W, so Pittsburgh is further west.

Similarly, for New York state, Buffalo is about 78.8° W, and Cattaraugus County is near there.

Cattaraugus County, NY: let's find a point there. The county seat is Little Valley, or Olean is a larger town. Olean, NY coordinates: approximately 42.08° N, 78.43° W.

I think that's right. Let me confirm: yes, Olean, NY is in Cattaraugus County at about 78.43° W.

Now, Cambria County, PA: Johnstown is the main city. Johnstown, PA coordinates: approximately 40.33° N, 78.92° W.

Is that accurate? Let me think: Johnstown should be west of Altoona, which is around 78.4° W, I think. Altoona is in Blair County, east of Cambria.

Blair County is to the east of Cambria County. Cambria County is west of Blair.

Counties in PA: from east to west, Blair, then Cambria. Johnstown is in Cambria, Altoona in Blair.

Longitude of Altoona, PA: I think it's about 78.4° W. Johnstown should be a bit west of that.

Yes, Johnstown is at approximately 78.92° W.

Now, Olean, NY is at about 78.43° W.

So, comparing:

- Olean, NY (Cattaraugus County): 78.43° W

- Johnstown, PA (Cambria County): 78.92° W

Since 78.92 is greater than 78.43, that means Johnstown is further west than Olean.

Longitude: higher number in degrees west means further west.

78.92° W is west of 78.43° W.

Therefore, Cambria County, PA is west of Cattaraugus County, NY.

But is this for the county centers or just specific points? Counties have areas, so I need to consider the general position.

Cattaraugus County extends a bit. For example, the western part of Cattaraugus County might be further west.

Cattaraugus County borders Pennsylvania, and its western edge is around 79° W, I think? Let me see.

The border between NY and PA is at approximately 79° W longitude? No, not a straight line.

The state line is not straight; it's defined by survey lines, but generally, the western part of Cattaraugus County might be closer to 79° W.

But let's find the approximate longitude range.

Cattaraugus County, NY: according to my knowledge, the eastern part is around 78.2° W (like Ellicottville), and western part is about 79.0° W near the border with Chautauqua County.

Chautauqua County is further west, with Jamestown at about 79.24° W.

But Cattaraugus County: Olean is at 78.43° W, and Salamanca, which is in Cattaraugus, is at about 78.72° W. Salamanca is on the border.

Salamanca, NY is in Cattaraugus County at approximately 42.16° N, 78.72° W.

Now, Cambria County, PA: Johnstown at 78.92° W, but the county extends. Ebensburg, the county seat, is at about 78.72° W? No, Ebensburg is slightly east of Johnstown.

Ebensburg, PA: approximately 40.48° N, 78.72° W? Let me think.

Johnstown is roughly 78.92° W, and since Ebensburg is north and a bit east, it might be around 78.8° W or something.

But to be precise, let's take the coordinates.

I recall that the eastern border of Cambria County is around 78.5° W, and western around 79.0° W or so. But let's not overcomplicate.

Since Cattaraugus County has points as west as about 78.72° W (Salamanca), and Cambria County has Johnstown at 78.92° W.

78.92 > 78.72, so Johnstown is west of Salamanca.

Moreover, Cambria County is entirely south and west relative to Cattaraugus? No, south but not necessarily west.

Let's plot this.

Cattaraugus County, NY: longitude from about 78.2° W to 79.0° W? Salamanca is 78.72° W, and the border with Pennsylvania is at similar longitude.

The PA-NY border in that area is along 42° N latitude, but longitude varies.

For Cattaraugus County, the westernmost point is near Chautauqua County, around 79.0° W.

But Cambria County, PA: the easternmost point is around 78.5° W, westernmost around 79.0° W, but Johnstown is central at 78.92° W.

Now, directly south of Cattaraugus County is McKean County, PA, which is at similar longitudes.

Cambria County is east of McKean County.

McKean County, PA borders Cattaraugus County, NY.

McKean County has Bradford, PA at about 78.65° W.

Bradford, PA is in McKean County at approximately 41.96° N, 78.65° W.

Cattaraugus County has Salamanca at 78.72° W, which is very close.

Cambria County is to the southeast of McKean.

Cambria County shares a border with Clearfield County to the west and Indiana County to the south, but not directly with McKean; there's Elk County in between, I think.

Counties: McKean County, PA is west of Elk County, and Elk is west of Clearfield, but Cambria is south of Clearfield? Let's see the map mentally.

Pennsylvania counties: from north to south along the NY border.

Starting from NY border: Potter County, then McKean, then Elk, then Forest? But Forest is small.

Elk County is south of McKean, and Cambria is south of Clearfield and Indiana.

Cambria County is not adjacent to the NY border; it's inland.

The longitude of Cambria County is roughly from 78.5° W to 79.0° W.

Specifically, the city of Johnstown is at 78.92° W, and the eastern part, like Cresson, might be around 78.6° W.

Cresson, PA is in Cambria County at about 40.46° N, 78.59° W.

So Cambria County longitudes: approximately 78.59° W to 78.92° W or so.

Now Cattaraugus County: Salamanca at 78.72° W, Olean at 78.43° W, and the western part near Randolph or Steamburg might be around 79.0° W, but that's near the border with Chautauqua.

Chautauqua County starts around 79.0° W.

So Cattaraugus County longitudes: roughly from 78.2° W to 78.8° W or so. Salamanca is 78.72, and that's near the west.

Actually, the western border of Cattaraugus is about 79.0° W, but since Chautauqua is separate, let's say up to 78.8° W for practical purposes.

To be conservative, the westernmost point of Cattaraugus County is less than 79.0° W.

But Salamanca is 78.72° W, and that's a point in Cattaraugus.

Now, for Cambria County, the westernmost point might be around 78.92° W, but the county extends to similar longitudes.

But let's compare the centers or a reference point.

Since the question is "located west of", I think if the eastern part of Cambria is west of the western part of Cattaraugus, then yes, but that might not be the case.

Cattaraugus has points up to about 78.8° W, and Cambria has points down to 78.59° W.

78.59° W is east of 78.8° W? No: 78.59 is less than 78.8, so 78.59 is east of 78.8.

Longitude: smaller number means east if we are in the western hemisphere.

78.59° W vs 78.80° W: 78.59 < 78.80, so 78.59 is east of 78.80.

For example, 78.59° W is closer to prime meridian than 78.80° W, so 78.80° W is further west.

Therefore, the eastern part of Cambria County at 78.59° W is east of the western part of Cattaraugus at 78.80° W.

But we need to see on average or relatively.

Let's take specific points.

Cattaraugus County, NY: a point in the west, like Salamanca at 78.72° W.

Cambria County, PA: a point in the east, like Cresson at 78.59° W.

78.59 < 78.72, so Cresson is east of Salamanca.

Now, Cambria County west: Johnstown at 78.92° W, which is west of Salamanca's 78.72.

But since Cattaraugus has points west of some Cambria points, and Cambria has points west of Cattaraugus points, it might be mixed.

However, for the county as a whole, I think Cambria County is generally west of Cattaraugus County.

Let's think about the relative position.

Cattaraugus County is in New York, near the southwest corner, bordering Pennsylvania.

Cambria County is in Pennsylvania, about 100 miles south of the NY border and slightly east or west?

The NY-PA border is at about 42° N latitude.

Cattaraugus County is centered around 42.3° N, 78.6° W or so.

Cambria County is around 40.3° N, 78.8° W.

So latitude: Cambria is south, about 2 degrees south, which is significant.

Longitude: 78.8 vs 78.6, so about 0.2 degrees west.

Since one degree of longitude is about 53 miles at that latitude (40-42° N), 0.2 degrees is about 10.6 miles west.

So Cambria is slightly west and significantly south.

But to answer "west of", since 78.8 > 78.6, Cambria is west of Cattaraugus.

Moreover, the entire Cambria County is at longitudes greater than 78.5, while Cattaraugus has longitudes less than 78.8 except possibly small parts.

Cattaraugus County: Olean 78.43, Salamanca 78.72, and the western border is 78.8 or so. I think the maximum longitude is about 78.75 for Cattaraugus; let me confirm.

Upon second thought, Chautauqua County starts around 79.0, and Cattaraugus is east, so its western edge is less than 79.0. Salamanca is at 78.72, and that's near the Allegheny River, which is the border in some parts.

The longitude of the western border of Cattaraugus County is approximately 78.8° W.

For example, the town of Randolph, NY, which is in Cattaraugus, is at about 42.16° N, 78.98° W? Wait, that might be Chautauqua.

Randolph, NY is in Cattaraugus County? Let me think: Cattaraugus County towns include Randolph, and I think it's around 78.97° W.

Upon recall, Randolph, NY coordinates: approximately 42.16° N, 78.98° W, and it is in Cattaraugus County.

Yes, so longitude about 78.98° W.

Similarly, Salamanca is at 78.72° W.

So Cattaraugus County longitudes from about 78.2° W to 79.0° W.

Cambria County: Cresson at 78.59° W, Johnstown at 78.92° W, so from about 78.59° W to 78.92° W.

Now, comparing the ranges:

Cattaraugus min: 78.2° W, max: 79.0° W

Cambria min: 78.59° W, max: 78.92° W

So the easternmost point of Cambria is 78.59° W, which is west of the easternmost point of Cattaraugus at 78.2° W (since 78.59 > 78.2, so further west).

78.59 > 78.2, so 78.59 is west of 78.2.

Similarly, the westernmost point of Cambria is 78.92° W, and Cattaraugus has 79.0° W, so 79.0 > 78.92, meaning Cattaraugus westernmost is further west than Cambria westernmost.

79.0 is west of 78.92.

Therefore, Cattaraugus County extends further west than Cambria County.

Specifically, the western part of Cattaraugus is west of the western part of Cambria.

But for the county as a whole, since Cattaraugus has areas west of Cambria, and Cambria has areas east of some Cattaraugus areas, it's not entirely one west of the other.

However, the centroid or the average might be similar, but let's see.

To answer "is Cambria County located west of Cattaraugus County", I think we need to see if Cambria is entirely west or generally west.

But from the points, Cambria is not entirely west; for example, Cresson, PA at 78.59° W is east of Randolph, NY at 78.98° W, but also east of Salamanca at 78.72° W? 78.59 < 78.72, so Cresson is east of Salamanca.

Similarly, Johnstown at 78.92 is west of Salamanca at 78.72.

But Salamanca is in Cattaraugus, so parts of Cambria are east of parts of Cattaraugus.

Moreover, the eastern part of Cattaraugus is at 78.2, which is east of all of Cambria.

But for the "located west of" in a general sense, I think it's ambiguous.

Perhaps I can look at the county seats or a central point.

Cattaraugus County seat is Little Valley, NY. Coordinates: approximately 42.25° N, 78.80° W? I think it's around there.

Little Valley, NY: 42.25° N, 78.80° W approximately.

Cambria County seat is Ebensburg, PA. Coordinates: approximately 40.48° N, 78.72° W.

Ebensburg: 78.72° W

Little Valley: 78.80° W

78.80 > 78.72, so Little Valley is west of Ebensburg.

Therefore, the county seat of Cattaraugus is west of the county seat of Cambria.
