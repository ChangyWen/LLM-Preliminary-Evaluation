*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are comparing the longitude of Cambria County, PA and Cattaraugus County, NY.
 Longitude: The further west a location is, the more negative its longitude (in the Western Hemisphere, using the decimal degrees system).

 Steps:
 1. Find the approximate longitude of the center (or a representative point) of Cambria County, PA.
 2. Find the approximate longitude of the center (or a representative point) of Cattaraugus County, NY.
 3. Compare the two longitudes: if the longitude of Cambria County is more negative (or less positive) than that of Cattaraugus County, then Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County.

 Let's look up the coordinates:

 Cambria County, PA:
   - According to available data, the county seat is Ebensburg, PA.
   - Coordinates of Ebensburg: approximately 40.4856° N, 78.7247° W.

 Cattaraugus County, NY:
   - The county seat is Little Valley, NY.
   - Coordinates of Little Valley: approximately 42.2520° N, 78.8053° W.

 But note: we can also consider the approximate center of the counties. Alternatively, we can use known geographic data.

 However, let's compare the longitudes we have:
   - Cambria County (Ebensburg): 78.7247° W
   - Cattaraugus County (Little Valley): 78.8053° W

 Wait, note that both are in the west, so they are negative if we use the convention where east is positive and west is negative in a decimal system (but the degrees are usually given as positive with a W suffix). In decimal degrees for west, we use negative values when doing calculations.

 But in the given coordinates, they are both given in degrees west, meaning they are both negative in decimal notation? Actually, in the standard coordinate system (like WGS84), longitudes in the western hemisphere are negative. So:

   - Ebensburg: 78.7247° W is equivalent to -78.7247
   - Little Valley: 78.8053° W is equivalent to -78.8053

 Now, we compare the two longitudes:

   Cambria County: -78.7247
   Cattaraugus County: -78.8053

 Which one is more west? The more negative value is further west.

 Since -78.8053 is more negative than -78.7247, that means Cattaraugus County (Little Valley) is actually further west than Cambria County.

 Therefore, Cambria County is NOT west of Cattaraugus County. Instead, it is east of Cattaraugus County.

 However, let's double-check with another point. What if we take the westernmost point of Cambria County and the easternmost point of Cattaraugus County? But that might be overcomplicating.

 Alternatively, we can look at a map or use known geographic data:

 According to a map:

   Cambria County, PA is located in west-central Pennsylvania.
   Cattaraugus County, NY is located in western New York, and it borders Pennsylvania.

   The border between New York and Pennsylvania runs along the 42nd parallel north. Cattaraugus County is entirely north of the border (so above the 42nd parallel) and Cambria County is entirely south of that border (so below the 42nd parallel). However, we are only concerned with east-west (longitude).

   Let's look at the western edge of Cattaraugus County and the eastern edge of Cambria County? Actually, we don't need that. We are comparing the entire counties. The center points are representative.

   But note: the longitude of Little Valley (Cattaraugus County) is about 78.8053° W and Ebensburg (Cambria County) is about 78.7247° W. So the center of Cattaraugus County is more west than the center of Cambria County.

   Therefore, Cambria County is to the east of Cattaraugus County.

   So the answer is: No, Cambria County, PA is not located west of Cattaraugus County, NY.

   However, let's consider the entire county boundaries. It is possible that a part of Cambria County might be west of a part of Cattaraugus County? But they are not adjacent. They are separated by other counties.

   In fact, between Cambria County and Cattaraugus County, there are several counties:

     - To the west of Cambria County in PA: Indiana County, then Allegheny County, and then the state border with Ohio? But that's not adjacent to New York.

     - Actually, the western border of Pennsylvania is shared with Ohio, but the northern border of Pennsylvania is shared with New York. So Cambria County is not adjacent to New York. The adjacent PA county to Cattaraugus County would be McKean County, PA, which is directly south of Cattaraugus County.

   Therefore, the entire Cambria County is to the east and south of Cattaraugus County.

   Hence, the answer is No.

   But let's verify with another method: using the geographic center of the counties.

   According to the U.S. Census Bureau:

   - Cambria County, PA:
        Latitude: 40.5° N, Longitude: 78.7° W   (approximately)

   - Cattaraugus County, NY:
        Latitude: 42.3° N, Longitude: 78.7° W   (approximately)

   Wait, that's about the same longitude? Then we need to be more precise.

   Actually, from the coordinates we had earlier:

        Cambria (Ebensburg): -78.7247
        Cattaraugus (Little Valley): -78.8053

   So the difference is about 0.0806 degrees. That's about 5.5 miles (since 1 degree of longitude at that latitude is about 50 miles). So 0.08 degrees is about 4 miles. So the center of Cattaraugus County is about 4 miles west of the center of Cambria County? Actually, wait:

   The difference in longitude is 0.0806 degrees. At 40°N, 1 degree of longitude is about 53 miles (85 km). But at 42°N, 1 degree of longitude is about 52 miles. So the distance difference in longitude at 40°N would be 0.0806 * 53 ≈ 4.27 miles. But note that the centers are at different latitudes. So the actual east-west distance is less than that because the longitude lines converge.

   However, the point is that the center of Cattaraugus County is at a more westerly longitude.

   Therefore, Cambria County is not west of Cattaraugus County.

   Final Answer: No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if Cambria County, PA is located west of Cattaraugus County, NY, we compare their longitudes. A more negative longitude (further west) indicates a location further west.

1. **Identify representative coordinates:**
   - **Cambria County, PA:** The county seat is Ebensburg. Coordinates: approximately 40.4856° N, 78.7247° W. In decimal degrees (with west as negative): **-78.7247**.
   - **Cattaraugus County, NY:** The county seat is Little Valley. Coordinates: approximately 42.2520° N, 78.8053° W. In decimal degrees: **-78.8053**.

2. **Compare longitudes:**
   - Cambria County: -78.7247
   - Cattaraugus County: -78.8053
   - Since -78.8053 is more negative than -78.7247, Cattaraugus County has a more westerly longitude.

3. **Conclusion:**
   Cambria County is **not** west of Cattaraugus County. Instead, it is east of Cattaraugus County because its longitude is less negative (higher value).

**Final Answer: No**
