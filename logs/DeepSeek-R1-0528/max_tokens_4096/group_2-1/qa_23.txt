First, the question is: "Is the pH of lemon juice lower than that of water?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. It ranges from 0 to 14, with lower numbers being more acidic, higher numbers more basic, and 7 being neutral.

Water is neutral, so its pH is 7. That's standard for pure water at 25°C.

Lemon juice is acidic because it contains citric acid. Acids have pH values less than 7.

I recall that lemon juice has a pH around 2 to 3. Let me confirm that. Yes, typically, lemon juice is between pH 2 and 3, depending on the lemon and how it's prepared, but it's definitely acidic.

So, if water has a pH of 7 and lemon juice has a pH of about 2 or 3, then lemon juice has a lower pH than water.

Lower pH means more acidic. Since 2 is less than 7, yes, lemon juice has a lower pH.

I should make sure about the pH values. Is tap water different? The question says "water," which I assume means pure water, like distilled or deionized water, with pH 7. If it's tap water, it might be slightly different, but generally, it's still around 7. Lemon juice is consistently acidic.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. pH scale: 0 to 14, with 7 neutral.

2. Water: neutral, pH = 7.

3. Lemon juice: acidic due to citric acid.

4. Typical pH of lemon juice: between 2 and 3.

5. Comparison: 2 < 7 or 3 < 7, so lemon juice pH is less than water pH.

Therefore, yes, the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

So, I need to present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding pH**: The pH scale measures how acidic or basic a solution is, ranging from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral (like pure water), values below 7 are acidic, and values above 7 are basic. Lower pH values indicate higher acidity.

2. **pH of Water**: Pure water (e.g., distilled water) has a neutral pH of 7 at standard conditions (25°C). This is a well-established reference point.

3. **pH of Lemon Juice**: Lemon juice is acidic because it contains citric acid and other organic acids. Based on scientific measurements, the pH of lemon juice typically ranges from 2.0 to 3.0. This is due to its high concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺), which is characteristic of acidic substances.

4. **Comparison**:
   - Water pH = 7 (neutral).
   - Lemon juice pH ≈ 2.0–3.0 (acidic).
   - Since 2.0–3.0 is less than 7, lemon juice has a lower pH than water.

5. **Conclusion**: Because lemon juice is acidic and water is neutral, the pH of lemon juice is indeed lower than that of water.

**Final Answer: Yes**
