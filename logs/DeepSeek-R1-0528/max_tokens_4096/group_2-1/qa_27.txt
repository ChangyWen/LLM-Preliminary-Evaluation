*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the melting point of ice lower than the boiling point of water?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the melting point of ice is the temperature at which ice turns into water. For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, that's 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

The boiling point of water is the temperature at which water turns into steam. At standard atmospheric pressure, that's 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

So, comparing 0 degrees Celsius to 100 degrees Celsius, 0 is less than 100. That means the melting point is lower than the boiling point.

I should confirm the units. The question doesn't specify units, but in science, we usually use Celsius or Kelvin for such comparisons. In Kelvin, melting point is 273 K and boiling point is 373 K. Still, 273 < 373, so melting point is lower.

Is there any condition where this might not be true? For example, under different pressures. But the question doesn't mention pressure, so I think we can assume standard atmospheric pressure.

The question says "ice" and "water," which implies pure water, not something with impurities that might change the melting or boiling point. For instance, salt lowers the melting point of ice, but here it's just "ice," so I think it's pure.

Therefore, under normal conditions, the melting point of ice (0°C) is indeed lower than the boiling point of water (100°C).

So, the answer should be Yes.

Now, to structure my response: I need to show step-by-step reasoning and then the final answer.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall that the melting point of ice is 0 degrees Celsius under standard conditions.

2. Recall that the boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius under standard conditions.

3. Compare 0°C and 100°C: 0 is less than 100.

4. Therefore, the melting point is lower than the boiling point.

Final answer: Yes

I should make sure there's no trick here. Is ice considered different from water? Melting point of ice is the same as freezing point of water, both 0°C. Boiling point is for liquid water to steam.

Yes, that's standard.

In terms of phase changes, melting point is for solid to liquid, boiling point for liquid to gas. So for water, solid to liquid at 0°C, liquid to gas at 100°C, so yes, 0 < 100.

I think it's straightforward.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Identify the melting point of ice**:  
   The melting point of ice is the temperature at which solid ice transitions to liquid water. Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), this temperature is **0 degrees Celsius (°C)** for pure water.

2. **Identify the boiling point of water**:  
   The boiling point of water is the temperature at which liquid water transitions to water vapor (steam). Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), this temperature is **100 degrees Celsius (°C)** for pure water.

3. **Compare the two temperatures**:  
   - Melting point of ice: 0°C  
   - Boiling point of water: 100°C  
   Since 0°C is less than 100°C, the melting point of ice is lower than the boiling point of water.

4. **Consider units and conditions**:  
   - The comparison is consistent across common temperature scales:  
     - In Celsius: 0°C < 100°C  
     - In Kelvin: Melting point is 273 K, boiling point is 373 K; 273 K < 373 K  
   - The question does not specify pressure or impurities, so standard conditions (1 atm, pure water) are assumed. Under these conditions, the relationship holds.

5. **Eliminate potential misconceptions**:  
   - Ice and water refer to the same substance (H₂O) in different phases.  
   - Changes in pressure or impurities (e.g., salt) can alter melting or boiling points, but the question implies standard, pure conditions.  
   - The phase transition temperatures are distinct: melting (solid to liquid) occurs at a lower temperature than boiling (liquid to gas) for water.

**Final Answer: Yes**
