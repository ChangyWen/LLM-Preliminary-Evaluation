*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the boiling point of water higher than the freezing point of water?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius and boils at 100 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. That's basic science.

The freezing point is when water turns from liquid to solid, which is 0°C. The boiling point is when water turns from liquid to gas, which is 100°C.

Now, comparing 100°C to 0°C: 100 is greater than 0, so the boiling point is higher than the freezing point.

I should confirm if there's any trick here. The question doesn't specify any conditions, like pressure or altitude, so I'll assume standard conditions. At standard pressure, this is straightforward.

In other units, like Fahrenheit, water freezes at 32°F and boils at 212°F. Again, 212 is higher than 32, so boiling point is higher.

The question is about water specifically, and it's a fundamental property.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius.

2. Recall that the boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius.

3. Compare the two values: 100 > 0.

4. Therefore, the boiling point is higher than the freezing point.

Since the question asks for Yes or No, and it's clear, the answer should be Yes.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the freezing point of water:**  
   The freezing point of water is the temperature at which liquid water turns into ice. Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm or 101.3 kPa), this is 0 degrees Celsius (°C) or 32 degrees Fahrenheit (°F).

2. **Identify the boiling point of water:**  
   The boiling point of water is the temperature at which liquid water turns into vapor (steam). Under standard atmospheric pressure, this is 100 degrees Celsius (°C) or 212 degrees Fahrenheit (°F).

3. **Compare the numerical values:**  
   - In Celsius: 100 °C (boiling point) vs. 0 °C (freezing point).  
     Since 100 is greater than 0, the boiling point is higher.  
   - In Fahrenheit: 212 °F (boiling point) vs. 32 °F (freezing point).  
     Since 212 is greater than 32, the boiling point is higher.

4. **Consider any exceptions or conditions:**  
   The question does not specify any non-standard conditions (e.g., altitude, pressure changes), so we assume standard atmospheric pressure. Under these conditions, the relationship holds true universally for pure water.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   Based on the comparison, the boiling point of water is indeed higher than the freezing point.

**Final Answer: Yes**
