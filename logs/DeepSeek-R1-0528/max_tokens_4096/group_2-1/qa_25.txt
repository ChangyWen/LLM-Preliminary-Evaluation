We are comparing the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon to that on Earth.

The acceleration due to gravity on a celestial body is given by the formula:

  g = G * M / R^2

where:
  G is the universal gravitational constant,
  M is the mass of the celestial body,
  R is the radius of the celestial body.

We know that the Moon is smaller and less massive than Earth.

Specifically:

- Mass of Earth (M_earth) ≈ 5.972 × 10^24 kg
- Mass of Moon (M_moon) ≈ 7.342 × 10^22 kg

So the Moon's mass is about 1/81.3 of Earth's mass.

- Radius of Earth (R_earth) ≈ 6,371 km = 6,371,000 m
- Radius of Moon (R_moon) ≈ 1,737 km = 1,737,000 m

So the Moon's radius is about 1/3.668 of Earth's radius.

Now, let's compute the ratio of the Moon's gravity to Earth's gravity:

  g_moon / g_earth = [G * M_moon / R_moon^2] / [G * M_earth / R_earth^2]
                   = (M_moon / M_earth) * (R_earth^2 / R_moon^2)

Plug in the ratios:

  M_moon / M_earth ≈ (7.342 × 10^22) / (5.972 × 10^24) ≈ 0.0123 (or about 1/81.3)

  R_earth / R_moon ≈ 6,371 / 1,737 ≈ 3.668

Therefore:

  (R_earth / R_moon)^2 ≈ (3.668)^2 ≈ 13.45

Then:

  g_moon / g_earth ≈ 0.0123 * 13.45 ≈ 0.165

This means that the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is about 0.165 times that on Earth.

Alternatively, we can use the known values:

  g_earth ≈ 9.8 m/s²
  g_moon ≈ 1.62 m/s²

So, 1.62 is less than 9.8.

Therefore, the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is less than that on Earth.

Final answer: Yes

To determine if the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is less than that on Earth, we compare the gravitational accelerations using the formula for gravitational acceleration at the surface:

\[ g = \frac{GM}{R^2} \]

where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant,
- \( M \) is the mass of the celestial body,
- \( R \) is its radius.

The ratio of the Moon's gravity to Earth's gravity is:

\[ \frac{g_{\text{moon}}}{g_{\text{earth}}} = \frac{M_{\text{moon}} / R_{\text{moon}}^2}{M_{\text{earth}} / R_{\text{earth}}^2} = \frac{M_{\text{moon}}}{M_{\text{earth}}} \times \left( \frac{R_{\text{earth}}}{R_{\text{moon}}} \right)^2 \]

Using known values:
- Mass of Earth, \( M_{\text{earth}} = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \)
- Mass of Moon, \( M_{\text{moon}} = 7.342 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg} \)
- Radius of Earth, \( R_{\text{earth}} = 6.371 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \)
- Radius of Moon, \( R_{\text{moon}} = 1.737 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \)

Calculate the mass ratio:
\[ \frac{M_{\text{moon}}}{M_{\text{earth}}} = \frac{7.342 \times 10^{22}}{5.972 \times 10^{24}} \approx 0.0123 \]

Calculate the radius ratio:
\[ \frac{R_{\text{earth}}}{R_{\text{moon}}} = \frac{6.371 \times 10^6}{1.737 \times 10^6} \approx 3.668 \]
Then square it:
\[ \left( \frac{R_{\text{earth}}}{R_{\text{moon}}} \right)^2 = (3.668)^2 \approx 13.45 \]

Now compute the gravity ratio:
\[ \frac{g_{\text{moon}}}{g_{\text{earth}}} = 0.0123 \times 13.45 \approx 0.165 \]

This means \( g_{\text{moon}} \) is approximately 0.165 times \( g_{\text{earth}} \). Since \( g_{\text{earth}} \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), \( g_{\text{moon}} \approx 1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), which is less than 9.8 m/s².

Thus, the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is less than that on Earth.

**Final Answer: Yes**
