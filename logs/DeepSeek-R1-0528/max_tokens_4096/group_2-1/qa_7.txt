*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is a cheetah faster than a lion?" I need to provide a step-by-step reasoning process and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that cheetahs are known for being the fastest land animals. Lions are also fast, but I think cheetahs are quicker. Let me recall some facts.

Step 1: Recall the top speeds of both animals.

- Cheetah: I think cheetahs can run up to 60-70 miles per hour (mph). Specifically, I remember that cheetahs can reach about 70 mph in short bursts.

- Lion: Lions are powerful, but they're not as fast. I think lions can run up to 50 mph, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

I should base this on reliable knowledge. From what I've learned, cheetahs are built for speed with their lightweight bodies, long legs, and flexible spines. Lions are more muscular and built for strength, not speed.

Step 2: Compare the speeds.

- Cheetah top speed: Approximately 70 mph (112 km/h). This is well-documented.

- Lion top speed: I believe it's around 50 mph (80 km/h). Lions can run fast in short distances, but not as fast as cheetahs.

Step 3: Consider the context. The question is about speed, so I should focus on maximum speed, not endurance. Cheetahs are sprinters, meaning they can run very fast for short periods, like 20-30 seconds. Lions might have more stamina, but for top speed, cheetahs win.

Step 4: Confirm with known facts. I think it's common knowledge that cheetahs are faster. For example, in documentaries, cheetahs are shown chasing down prey like gazelles at high speeds, while lions rely on stealth and teamwork.

Step 5: Final comparison.

- Cheetah: 70 mph

- Lion: 50 mph

Therefore, 70 > 50, so cheetah is faster.

I should make sure about the lion's speed. Is 50 mph accurate? Let me double-check in my mind.

Yes, according to sources like National Geographic or animal encyclopedias, lions can reach up to 50 mph, while cheetahs can hit 60-70 mph. Some sources say cheetahs can even reach 75 mph in ideal conditions.

So, the difference is clear.

Step 6: Answer the question.

Final answer: Yes, a cheetah is faster than a lion.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether a cheetah is faster than a lion. This requires comparing their maximum running speeds, as speed is typically measured in terms of top velocity over short distances for such animals.

2. **Recall Key Facts about Cheetahs**:
   - Cheetahs are widely recognized as the fastest land animals on Earth.
   - Their top speed is approximately **70 miles per hour (mph)** or **112 kilometers per hour (km/h)**. This speed is achieved in short bursts (around 20-30 seconds) during hunts.
   - Cheetahs have physical adaptations for speed, such as a lightweight build, long legs, a flexible spine, and specialized muscles that allow for rapid acceleration.

3. **Recall Key Facts about Lions**:
   - Lions are powerful predators but are not built for extreme speed. They rely more on strength, teamwork, and stealth for hunting.
   - Their top speed is about **50 miles per hour (mph)** or **80 kilometers per hour (km/h)**. This is also a short-burst speed, as lions can maintain high speeds only for very short distances due to their heavier build.

4. **Compare the Speeds**:
   - Cheetah top speed: 70 mph (112 km/h).
   - Lion top speed: 50 mph (80 km/h).
   - Since 70 mph is greater than 50 mph, the cheetah is faster in terms of maximum achievable speed.

5. **Consider Context and Reliability**:
   - Speed data comes from reputable sources like wildlife documentaries, zoological studies, and organizations such as National Geographic and the African Wildlife Foundation.
   - While lions may have better endurance over longer distances, the question focuses on raw speed, where cheetahs hold a clear advantage.
   - There are no scenarios where a lion can outpace a cheetah in a straight sprint, as the speed difference is significant (about 20 mph or 32 km/h faster for the cheetah).

6. **Final Verification**:
   - Based on all available evidence, it is a well-established fact that cheetahs are faster than lions. This is not controversial in the field of biology or wildlife research.

**Final Answer: Yes**
