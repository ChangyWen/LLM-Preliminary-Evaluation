First, I need to determine the death years of Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton. The question is whether Einstein died later than Newton, meaning after Newton.

I recall that Isaac Newton was a famous physicist and mathematician from the 17th and 18th centuries. He was born in 1643 and died in 1727. Let me confirm that. Yes, Sir Isaac Newton died on March 31, 1727.

Now, Albert Einstein is more modern; he was a physicist in the 20th century. He was born in 1879 and died in 1955. Specifically, he died on April 18, 1955.

So, Newton died in 1727, and Einstein died in 1955. Clearly, 1955 is much later than 1727. Therefore, Einstein did die later than Newton.

I should make sure about the dates. Let me double-check:

- Isaac Newton: Born January 4, 1643; died March 31, 1727.

- Albert Einstein: Born March 14, 1879; died April 18, 1955.

Yes, those are correct. 1955 is after 1727, so Einstein died later.

The question is straightforward: "Did Albert Einstein die later than Isaac Newton?" Based on the years, it's a clear yes.

Now, for the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the death year of Isaac Newton: 1727.

2. Identify the death year of Albert Einstein: 1955.

3. Compare the years: 1955 is greater than 1727, meaning 1955 comes after 1727.

4. Therefore, Einstein died later than Newton.

Finally, the answer should be "Yes".

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)." So I need to present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Isaac Newton's death year:**
   - Isaac Newton was a renowned physicist and mathematician.
   - He died on **March 31, 1727**. This is a well-established historical fact.

2. **Identify Albert Einstein's death year:**
   - Albert Einstein was a famous physicist known for his theory of relativity.
   - He died on **April 18, 1955**. This is also a well-documented historical fact.

3. **Compare the death years:**
   - Newton died in **1727**.
   - Einstein died in **1955**.
   - Since 1955 is numerically greater than 1727, 1955 occurs after 1727 on the timeline.

4. **Conclusion based on the comparison:**
   - Because Einstein died in 1955 and Newton died in 1727, Einstein died later than Newton.

**Final Answer: Yes**
