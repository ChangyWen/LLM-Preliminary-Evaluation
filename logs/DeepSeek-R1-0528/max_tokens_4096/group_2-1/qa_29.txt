*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the wavelength of red light longer than that of blue light?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I recall that light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. Red light and blue light are both visible light, but they have different wavelengths.

The visible spectrum ranges from about 400 nanometers (nm) for violet light to about 700 nm for red light. Blue light is around 450-495 nm, and red light is around 620-750 nm. I need to be precise.

Let me think about the order of colors in the rainbow or the spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Red has the longest wavelength, and violet has the shortest. Blue is towards the shorter end, but not the shortest.

Wavelength decreases as we go from red to violet. So, red has the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum, and blue has a shorter wavelength.

Specifically:

- Red light: approximately 620-750 nm

- Blue light: approximately 450-495 nm

Since 620-750 nm is greater than 450-495 nm, yes, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

I can think in terms of frequency. Wavelength and frequency are related by the speed of light: c = λν, where c is the speed of light, λ is wavelength, and ν is frequency.

Since c is constant, if wavelength is longer, frequency is lower. Red light has a lower frequency than blue light, which means it has a longer wavelength.

Yes, that makes sense. For example, red light might have a frequency around 430-480 THz, and blue light around 620-680 THz. Higher frequency means shorter wavelength.

So, blue light has higher frequency, thus shorter wavelength, and red light has lower frequency, thus longer wavelength.

Therefore, the wavelength of red light is indeed longer than that of blue light.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "show your step-by-step reasoning process," so I need to outline that clearly.

Step 1: Recall that light is an electromagnetic wave, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths within the visible spectrum.

Step 2: The visible spectrum ranges from approximately 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red).

Step 3: Blue light has wavelengths around 450-495 nm.

Step 4: Red light has wavelengths around 620-750 nm.

Step 5: Since 620-750 nm is greater than 450-495 nm, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

Step 6: Alternatively, using the relationship between wavelength and frequency: c = λν. Since the speed of light is constant, longer wavelength implies lower frequency. Red light has lower frequency than blue light, confirming that red has a longer wavelength.

So, the answer is Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

1. **Understand the electromagnetic spectrum**: Light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and visible light consists of different colors, each with a specific range of wavelengths. The visible spectrum ranges from approximately 380 nanometers (nm) for violet light to about 750 nm for red light.

2. **Identify the wavelength ranges for red and blue light**:
   - Red light has wavelengths in the range of approximately **620–750 nm**.
   - Blue light has wavelengths in the range of approximately **450–495 nm**.

3. **Compare the wavelength ranges**:
   - The minimum wavelength for red light (620 nm) is greater than the maximum wavelength for blue light (495 nm).
   - Specifically, 620 nm > 495 nm, and this holds true across the entire typical ranges (e.g., 750 nm for red vs. 450 nm for blue).

4. **Consider the relationship between wavelength and frequency**:
   - The speed of light (\(c\)) is constant (approximately \(3 \times 10^8\) m/s), and it relates wavelength (\(\lambda\)) and frequency (\(\nu\)) by the formula \(c = \lambda \nu\).
   - Red light has a lower frequency than blue light (e.g., red light frequency is about 400–484 THz, while blue light is about 606–668 THz).
   - Since \(c\) is constant, a lower frequency corresponds to a longer wavelength. Therefore, red light must have a longer wavelength than blue light.

5. **General knowledge of the visible spectrum**:
   - In the sequence of visible light colors (ROYGBIV: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), red has the longest wavelength, and violet has the shortest. Blue is closer to the shorter-wavelength end, confirming that red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.
