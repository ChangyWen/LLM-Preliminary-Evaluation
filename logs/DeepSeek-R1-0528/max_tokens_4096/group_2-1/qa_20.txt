*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the atomic number of oxygen higher than that of carbon?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a yes or no.

The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It defines the element and its position on the periodic table.

I need to recall the atomic numbers for carbon and oxygen.

Starting with carbon: Carbon is element number 6 on the periodic table. So, its atomic number is 6. That means it has 6 protons.

Now, oxygen: Oxygen is element number 8. So, its atomic number is 8, meaning 8 protons.

I should confirm this. The periodic table is ordered by atomic number. Elements are listed in increasing order of atomic number.

- Hydrogen: 1

- Helium: 2

- Lithium: 3

- Beryllium: 4

- Boron: 5

- Carbon: 6

- Nitrogen: 7

- Oxygen: 8

Yes, carbon is 6, oxygen is 8.

So, oxygen has an atomic number of 8, which is higher than carbon's atomic number of 6.

Therefore, yes, the atomic number of oxygen is higher than that of carbon.

The question asks for step-by-step reasoning, so I should outline that clearly.

Step 1: Recall that atomic number is the number of protons in an atom.

Step 2: Identify the atomic number of carbon. Carbon has an atomic number of 6.

Step 3: Identify the atomic number of oxygen. Oxygen has an atomic number of 8.

Step 4: Compare the two numbers: 8 > 6, so oxygen has a higher atomic number.

Final answer: Yes.

I think that's straightforward. No tricks here; it's a basic fact.

Just to be thorough, is there any isotope or something that might affect this? No, atomic number is fixed for an element; it doesn't change with isotopes. Isotopes have different mass numbers but the same atomic number.

So, carbon always has atomic number 6, oxygen always 8.

Therefore, oxygen's atomic number is higher.

Final answer should be yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand Atomic Number**: The atomic number of an element is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It is a unique identifier for each element and determines its position on the periodic table.

2. **Recall the Atomic Number of Carbon**: Carbon is an element with the symbol "C". From the periodic table, carbon has an atomic number of **6**. This means every carbon atom has 6 protons.

3. **Recall the Atomic Number of Oxygen**: Oxygen is an element with the symbol "O". From the periodic table, oxygen has an atomic number of **8**. This means every oxygen atom has 8 protons.

4. **Compare the Atomic Numbers**: We compare the atomic number of oxygen (8) with that of carbon (6). Since 8 is greater than 6, oxygen has a higher atomic number than carbon.

### Final Answer:
Yes
