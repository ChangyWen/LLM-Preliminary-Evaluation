*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the Sahara Desert hotter than the Gobi Desert?" I need to provide a step-by-step reasoning process and end with a final answer of Yes or No.

To answer this, I should compare the average temperatures of these two deserts. I know that the Sahara is in Africa, and it's the largest hot desert in the world. The Gobi Desert is in Asia, covering parts of northern China and southern Mongolia.

Now, thinking about temperatures: Deserts can have extreme temperatures, but I need to focus on which one is hotter on average.

I recall that the Sahara Desert is known for being extremely hot. For example, in places like the Libyan Desert or parts of Algeria, temperatures can reach over 50°C (122°F) in summer. The average high temperature in the Sahara during summer is around 38-40°C (100-104°F).

On the other hand, the Gobi Desert is a cold desert. It has hot summers, but it also has very cold winters. In summer, temperatures can be high, around 30-35°C (86-95°F), but in winter, they can drop to -40°C (-40°F) or lower. So, the annual average temperature might be lower because of the cold winters.

I should look for specific data. Since I'm an AI, I can access general knowledge up to my training data.

Average annual temperature for the Sahara: I think it's around 30°C (86°F) in the hottest parts, but it varies. Let's say the central Sahara has an average annual temperature of about 25-30°C.

For the Gobi, it's colder. I remember that the Gobi is classified as a cold desert because of its temperature range. The average annual temperature in the Gobi is lower, around 2-8°C (35-46°F), depending on the location.

That seems too low. Let me double-check my knowledge.

Upon second thought, the Gobi Desert has a continental climate with high temperature variations. Summer highs can be up to 45°C (113°F) in some areas, but winter lows are extremely cold. The mean annual temperature is about 2.5°C to 7.7°C (36.5°F to 45.9°F) for some parts. For example, Ulaanbaatar, which is near the Gobi, has a very cold winter, but it's not exactly in the desert. Direct Gobi data: I think places like Dalanzadgad in Mongolia have average highs in summer around 31°C and average lows in winter around -26°C. So annual average might be low.

For the Sahara, let's take a place like Timbuktu or somewhere in Mali. Average annual temperature around 28-30°C.

But to be precise, I should compare similar metrics.

Perhaps compare summer temperatures, since "hotter" might imply peak heat.

The question says "hotter," which could mean higher maximum temperatures or higher average temperatures. I think in common usage, when comparing deserts, people often refer to the heat during the day in summer.

But to be thorough, I should consider annual averages as well.

I found a reliable source in my knowledge: According to general desert information, the Sahara is generally hotter than the Gobi. For instance, the highest temperature recorded in the Sahara is 58°C (136.4°F) in Libya, while in the Gobi, it's around 50°C (122°F) in some areas. But recorded highs might not tell the whole story for average conditions.

For average summer temperatures:

- Sahara: Average high in July is about 38-40°C (100-104°F) in many areas.

- Gobi: Average high in July is about 30-35°C (86-95°F), but can be higher in some spots.

For example, in the Gobi Desert, the city of Hami in China has summer highs around 36°C, but that might be on the edge.

Let's take a specific location in each desert.

Sahara: Let's use In Salah, Algeria. Average high in July: 45°C (113°F), average low 30°C (86°F).

Gobi: Let's use Dalanzadgad, Mongolia. Average high in July: 31°C (88°F), average low 14°C (57°F).

So for summer, the Sahara is definitely hotter.

Now for annual average:

In Salah: Average annual temperature is around 28°C (82°F).

Dalanzadgad: Average annual temperature is about 3.5°C (38.3°F).

That's a big difference.

Even if we take a warmer part of the Gobi, like near the Chinese border, say Dunhuang, China. Dunhuang is on the edge of the Gobi. Average annual temperature is about 9-10°C (48-50°F), with summer highs around 34°C but winter lows cold.

Whereas in the Sahara, even in cooler parts, like northern Sahara, average annual is higher, say 20°C.

For instance, Cairo, Egypt, which is on the edge of the Sahara, has an average annual temperature of 21°C (70°F), and it's not even the hottest part.

In the central Sahara, it's much hotter.

So, in all aspects, the Sahara has higher temperatures than the Gobi, especially when considering average and peak heat.

The Gobi is called a cold desert for a reason, while the Sahara is a hot desert.

Therefore, the Sahara is hotter than the Gobi Desert.

Final answer should be Yes.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Identify the deserts: Sahara Desert in North Africa, Gobi Desert in East Asia.

2. Recall climate characteristics: Sahara is the world's largest hot desert with extremely high temperatures, especially in summer. Gobi is a cold desert with high temperature seasonality, including very cold winters.

3. Compare temperatures:
   - Peak summer temperatures: Sahara averages 38-45°C or higher, Gobi averages 30-35°C.
   - Record high temperatures: Sahara has recorded 58°C, Gobi around 50°C.
   - Annual average temperatures: Sahara around 25-30°C, Gobi around 2-10°C depending on location.

4. Conclusion: Based on average and extreme temperatures, the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine whether the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert, I'll compare key temperature metrics, including average annual temperatures, summer highs, and extreme records. Deserts can have significant temperature variations due to location, season, and climate type, so I'll use reliable data from geographical sources and climate databases. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Deserts and Their Climates**:
   - **Sahara Desert**: Located in North Africa, it is the world's largest hot desert. It has a hot desert climate (Köppen classification: BWh), characterized by extremely high temperatures year-round, with minimal seasonal variation in heat. Summers are scorching, and winters are mild to warm.
   - **Gobi Desert**: Located in East Asia (spanning northern China and southern Mongolia), it is a cold desert (Köppen classification: BWk). It experiences a continental climate with extreme seasonal temperature swings—hot summers but very cold winters, often with sub-zero temperatures.

2. **Compare Average Annual Temperatures**:
   - **Sahara**: The average annual temperature ranges from **25°C to 30°C (77°F to 86°F)** in most regions. For example:
     - In Salah, Algeria (central Sahara): Average annual temperature is **28°C (82°F)**.
     - Timbuktu, Mali (southern Sahara): Average annual temperature is **28.3°C (83°F)**.
   - **Gobi**: The average annual temperature is significantly lower, ranging from **2°C to 10°C (36°F to 50°F)** due to its cold winters. For example:
     - Dalanzadgad, Mongolia (central Gobi): Average annual temperature is **3.5°C (38.3°F)**.
     - Dunhuang, China (eastern Gobi): Average annual temperature is **9.3°C (48.7°F)**.
   - **Comparison**: The Sahara's average annual temperature is **15–20°C (27–36°F) higher** than the Gobi's, indicating it is consistently hotter year-round.

3. **Compare Summer (Peak Heat) Temperatures**:
   - **Sahara**: Summer (June-August) average high temperatures are typically **38–45°C (100–113°F)**, with some areas exceeding 45°C. For example:
     - In Salah, Algeria: July average high is **45°C (113°F)**.
     - Death Valley comparisons (though not Sahara, similar climate): Often cited for extreme heat, but Sahara locations like Libya have comparable highs.
   - **Gobi**: Summer average high temperatures are **30–35°C (86–95°F)**, with some areas reaching up to 40°C. For example:
     - Dalanzadgad, Mongolia: July average high is **31°C (88°F)**.
     - Hami, China (southern Gobi): July average high is **36°C (97°F)**.
   - **Comparison**: The Sahara's summer highs are **5–10°C (9–18°F) higher** on average, confirming it is hotter during the hottest season.

4. **Compare Extreme Temperature Records**:
   - **Sahara**: Holds some of the highest recorded temperatures on Earth. For example:
     - El Azizia, Libya (1922): Recorded **58°C (136.4°F)** (though this was later disputed, other readings like 55°C in Algeria are verified).
     - Reliable modern records show peaks of **50–55°C (122–131°F)** in summer.
   - **Gobi**: Extreme highs are lower. For example:
     - The highest recorded temperature in the Gobi is about **50°C (122°F)** in some areas, but this is rare and localized.
     - More typical extremes are **40–45°C (104–113°F)**.
   - **Comparison**: The Sahara has higher verified extreme temperatures, supporting that it is hotter.

5. **Consider Climate Factors**:
   - **Sahara**: Its hot desert climate results from persistent high pressure, clear skies, and low humidity, allowing intense solar heating year-round. Elevations are generally low, enhancing heat retention.
   - **Gobi**: As a cold desert, it has higher elevations (e.g., parts are over 1,000 meters) and strong continentality, leading to rapid heat loss in winter. Winter temperatures can plummet to **-40°C (-40°F)**, pulling down the annual average. While summers can be hot, they are shorter and less intense than the Sahara's.

**Final Answer**: Yes, the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert based on higher average annual temperatures, higher summer temperatures, and more extreme heat records.
