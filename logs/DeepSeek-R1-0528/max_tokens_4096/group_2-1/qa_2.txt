*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Mount Everest taller than K2?" I need to answer yes or no, and show my step-by-step reasoning.

I know that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, and K2 is the second tallest. But I should confirm the exact heights to be precise.

Let me recall the heights:

- Mount Everest is in the Himalayas, on the border between Nepal and China. Its height is approximately 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. I think this is the most commonly accepted height, but there might be slight variations due to surveys.

- K2 is in the Karakoram range, on the border between Pakistan and China. Its height is about 8,611 meters (28,251 feet). I think that's right.

I should double-check these figures to ensure accuracy. Since I'm an AI, I can access my knowledge base, but I need to reason step by step.

Step 1: Identify the mountains and their locations.

- Mount Everest: Part of the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. Coordinates: 27°59′17″N 86°55′31″E.

- K2: Part of the Karakoram Range. Coordinates: 35°52′57″N 76°30′48″E.

Step 2: Determine the heights.

I remember that the height of Mount Everest was officially recognized as 8,848 meters by a survey in 1955, and later confirmed by others. In 2020, China and Nepal jointly announced a new height of 8,848.86 meters, but for simplicity, we use 8,848 meters.

For K2, the height is generally accepted as 8,611 meters. I think it was first measured in 1856 and later confirmed.

To be thorough:

- Mount Everest height: 8,848 meters (29,029 feet)

- K2 height: 8,611 meters (28,251 feet)

Step 3: Compare the heights.

8,848 meters vs. 8,611 meters.

Since 8,848 > 8,611, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

The difference is 8,848 - 8,611 = 237 meters. So, Everest is taller by about 237 meters.

Step 4: Consider any controversies or changes.

I know that there was a time when K2 was thought to be taller, but that was before accurate measurements. With modern surveying, Everest is confirmed taller.

Also, sometimes people confuse prominence or other measures, but the question is about height above sea level, which is the standard for "tallest mountain."

K2 is often considered more difficult to climb due to its steepness and weather, but that doesn't affect its height.

Step 5: Final answer.

Based on the heights, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

So, the answer should be "Yes".

The question says "taller than K2", and since Everest is taller, it's yes.

Also, I need to box the final answer.

Reasoning process:

- Step 1: Mount Everest is located in the Himalayas with an elevation of approximately 8,848 meters.

- Step 2: K2 is located in the Karakoram Range with an elevation of approximately 8,611 meters.

- Step 3: Compare the elevations: 8,848 meters > 8,611 meters.

- Step 4: Therefore, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

1. **Identify the mountains and their standard heights:**
   - Mount Everest is the highest peak in the Himalayas, located on the border between Nepal and China. Its widely accepted elevation, based on multiple surveys (including the 2020 joint measurement by China and Nepal), is **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)** above sea level. For simplicity and consistency with most references, we'll use the rounded figure of **8,849 meters** (though 8,848 meters is also common; the difference is negligible for this comparison).
   - K2 is the second-highest peak in the world, located in the Karakoram Range on the border between Pakistan and China. Its standard elevation, confirmed by modern surveys, is **8,611 meters (28,251 feet)** above sea level.

2. **Compare the elevations numerically:**
   - Mount Everest: ~8,849 meters
   - K2: ~8,611 meters
   - Subtract K2's height from Mount Everest's height to find the difference:  
     8,849 m - 8,611 m = **238 meters** (or approximately 784 feet).

3. **Interpret the result:**
   - Since 8,849 meters is greater than 8,611 meters, Mount Everest is taller than K2 by about 238 meters.
   - This ranking is consistent across authoritative sources, such as the National Geographic Society, the Himalayan Database, and various geological surveys. No credible modern measurements dispute that Mount Everest is taller.

4. **Address potential misconceptions:**
   - K2 is often called the "Savage Mountain" due to its steepness and higher climbing difficulty, but this does not affect its height relative to Mount Everest.
   - Height is measured from sea level to the summit, which is the standard for comparing mountain elevations. Other metrics like topographic prominence (where K2 is significant but still less than Everest) do not change this conclusion.
   - Historical measurements (e.g., from the 19th century) once suggested K2 might be taller, but these were inaccurate and have been superseded by precise GPS and satellite data.

**Final Answer: Yes**  
Mount Everest is taller than K2 by approximately 238 meters.
