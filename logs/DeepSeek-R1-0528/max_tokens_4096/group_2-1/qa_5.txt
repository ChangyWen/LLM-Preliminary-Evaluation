First, the question is: "Is Russia larger in area than Australia?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Russia is the largest country in the world by land area, and Australia is also quite large, but I think Russia is bigger. To be precise, I should recall the actual areas.

Let me think about the approximate land areas:

- Russia: I remember it's about 17 million square kilometers. Specifically, I think it's 17,098,246 square kilometers. But I might not need that level of detail; an approximation should work for comparison.

- Australia: I think it's around 7.7 million square kilometers. Let me confirm: Australia includes the mainland and islands, so it's about 7,692,024 square kilometers or something close.

I should use reliable figures. Since this is a reasoning exercise, I can use common knowledge or standard figures.

Step 1: Recall the land area of Russia.

- Russia spans Eastern Europe and Northern Asia, and it's the largest country. I believe its area is approximately 17.1 million km².

Step 2: Recall the land area of Australia.

- Australia is the sixth-largest country, I think, after Russia, Canada, China, the USA, and Brazil. So, it should be smaller than Russia. Australia's area is about 7.7 million km².

Step 3: Compare the numbers.

- 17.1 million vs. 7.7 million. Clearly, 17.1 is greater than 7.7.

To be thorough, let's use more precise figures if I can remember them.

From memory:

- Russia: 17,098,246 km² (source: various geography sources)

- Australia: 7,692,024 km² (including all territories)

So, Russia: ~17.1 million km²

Australia: ~7.69 million km²

Therefore, Russia is larger.

But let me make sure about Australia. Is that just the mainland or including external territories? The standard area for Australia includes Tasmania and other islands, so it's about 7.692 million km².

Similarly, for Russia, it includes all its territory.

Another way to think: Russia covers more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, while Australia is a single continent but smaller.

I could think about the continents: Russia is part of Europe and Asia, but as a country, it's huge.

Australia is both a country and a continent, but its size is less than Russia.

Step 4: Numerical comparison.

Calculate the ratio: 17.1 / 7.7 ≈ 2.22, so Russia is more than twice as large as Australia.

Therefore, yes, Russia is larger.

But the question is straightforward, and I think I'm confident.

Final answer should be Yes.

So, I'll write it out.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine if Russia is larger in area than Australia, I will compare their total land areas using the most reliable and commonly cited figures from geographic sources. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Recall the land area of Russia**:
   - Russia is the largest country in the world by land area, spanning Eastern Europe and Northern Asia.
   - According to standard geographic data (e.g., from the United Nations or CIA World Factbook), Russia's total land area is approximately **17,098,246 square kilometers (km²)**. This includes all its territory, such as land and inland water bodies.

2. **Recall the land area of Australia**:
   - Australia is the sixth-largest country in the world by land area, consisting of the Australian mainland, the island of Tasmania, and other external territories.
   - The standard figure for Australia's total land area is approximately **7,692,024 km²** (also from sources like the United Nations or CIA World Factbook). This includes all territories and inland water bodies.

3. **Compare the two areas**:
   - Russia: 17,098,246 km²
   - Australia: 7,692,024 km²
   - Subtract Australia's area from Russia's to find the difference:  
     17,098,246 km² - 7,692,024 km² = 9,406,222 km²
   - This shows that Russia is larger by over 9 million km².
   - Alternatively, divide Russia's area by Australia's to find the ratio:  
     17,098,246 km² / 7,692,024 km² ≈ 2.22  
     This means Russia is more than twice the size of Australia.

4. **Conclusion based on comparison**:
   - Since 17,098,246 km² (Russia) is greater than 7,692,024 km² (Australia), Russia is indeed larger in area than Australia.

**Final Answer: Yes**
