*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is a blue whale heavier than an elephant?" I need to show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, and elephants are also very large, but I should recall specific weights.

Let me recall the average weight of a blue whale. I think blue whales can weigh up to 200 tons, but I should use average figures for comparison. Adult blue whales typically weigh between 100 to 150 tons. But I need to be careful with units. Tons can be metric tons or short tons, but for this purpose, I'll use metric tons since that's standard in scientific contexts.

A metric ton is 1,000 kilograms. So, blue whale: average weight is about 100 to 150 metric tons. Let's say 140 metric tons for a large adult. But I should use a reliable figure.

From what I remember, the maximum weight recorded for a blue whale is around 173 metric tons, but averages are lower. For comparison, I can use typical weights.

Similarly, for elephants, there are African elephants and Asian elephants. African elephants are larger. An adult male African bush elephant can weigh up to 6,000 to 7,000 kilograms, which is 6 to 7 metric tons. African forest elephants are smaller, and Asian elephants are a bit smaller too.

To be precise:

- African bush elephant: males average about 6,000 kg (6 metric tons), but can be up to 7,500 kg or more.

- Blue whale: average about 100,000 to 150,000 kg (100 to 150 metric tons).

That seems like a huge difference. Let me confirm these numbers.

I think I have it right. Blue whales are massive. For example, a blue whale's heart alone can weigh as much as a small car, around 400 kg or more. And an elephant is like a large land animal, but still much smaller.

Let me quantify:

Average weight of an adult blue whale: approximately 100,000 to 150,000 kg.

Average weight of an adult male African elephant: about 5,000 to 6,000 kg for Asian, but African up to 6,000 to 7,000 kg. Let's take 6,000 kg as a round figure.

So, 100,000 kg vs 6,000 kg. That means the blue whale is about 16 to 25 times heavier.

Even if I take the lower end for blue whale and upper for elephant:

Lower blue whale: 100,000 kg

Upper elephant: say 7,500 kg (which is high, but possible)

100,000 / 7,500 ≈ 13.3 times heavier.

So, definitely, blue whale is heavier.

But let's make sure about the elephant species. African elephants are larger, so I should compare to that.

Also, there might be record sizes, but for general comparison, average is fine.

I can look for specific data points, but since this is reasoning, I'll use common knowledge.

Another way: blue whales are often said to weigh as much as 200 tons, but that's rare. 200 metric tons is 200,000 kg.

Elephants: the heaviest recorded elephant was about 10,400 kg (African), but that's exceptional.

Blue whale: heaviest recorded was about 190,000 kg.

So, 190,000 kg vs 10,400 kg, still about 18 times heavier.

Therefore, without a doubt, a blue whale is heavier than an elephant.

The question is straightforward: "heavier than an elephant." Since elephants vary, but even the largest elephant is much lighter than an average blue whale.

So, my reasoning:

1. Identify the average weight of a blue whale: approximately 100,000 to 150,000 kg (100 to 150 metric tons).

2. Identify the average weight of the largest elephant species, the African bush elephant: approximately 5,000 to 7,000 kg (5 to 7 metric tons) for males.

3. Compare the weights: 100,000 kg > 7,000 kg by a large margin.

4. Therefore, yes, a blue whale is heavier than an elephant.

Final answer: Yes.

The question says "an elephant," which could be any, but even the smallest adult elephant, like a female Asian elephant, might be around 3,000 kg, which is still less than a blue whale's minimum.

Smallest blue whale adult is probably around 80,000 kg or so, but I think it's safe.

To be thorough, let's consider the weights:

- Blue whale: smallest adult might be 70 metric tons? I think average is higher, but let's say conservatively 80,000 kg.

- Elephant: largest ever recorded elephant was about 10,400 kg.

80,000 > 10,400, so yes.

Even if we take a calf, but I think we should consider adults, as the question implies typical adults.

So, no doubt.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the question**: The question asks whether a blue whale is heavier than an elephant. I need to compare the typical weights of these animals using reliable biological data. Both animals vary in size based on species, age, and sex, so I'll use average adult weights for a fair comparison.

2. **Recall key facts about blue whales**:
   - Blue whales (*Balaenoptera musculus*) are the largest animals on Earth.
   - Adult blue whales typically weigh between **100,000 kg and 150,000 kg** (100 to 150 metric tons).
   - For a conservative estimate, I'll use the lower end of this range (100,000 kg) to ensure accuracy, as some sources cite averages around 140,000 kg or higher.

3. **Recall key facts about elephants**:
   - Elephants come in different species, with the African bush elephant (*Loxodonta africana*) being the largest.
   - Adult male African bush elephants average **4,500 kg to 6,800 kg** (4.5 to 6.8 metric tons), with exceptional individuals reaching up to 10,000 kg.
   - For a fair comparison, I'll use the upper end of the average range (6,800 kg) for African bush elephants, as they are heavier than Asian elephants (which average 2,700–5,500 kg).

4. **Compare the weights**:
   - Blue whale (conservative minimum): **100,000 kg**
   - Elephant (conservative maximum): **6,800 kg**
   - Calculation: 100,000 kg > 6,800 kg by a significant margin (over 14 times heavier).

5. **Consider edge cases**:
   - The heaviest recorded blue whale weighed about 190,000 kg, while the heaviest recorded elephant (an African bush elephant) weighed about 10,400 kg. Even in this extreme case, the blue whale is much heavier.
   - If we consider smaller elephant species (e.g., Asian elephants or females), the weight difference is even larger. For example, an adult female Asian elephant averages about 2,700–3,600 kg, which is still far less than a blue whale.
   - Blue whale calves are born weighing around 2,700 kg (similar to an adult female Asian elephant), but adults are consistently heavier than any elephant.

6. **Conclusion based on data**: Blue whales are significantly heavier than elephants in all typical and recorded cases. Therefore, the answer is yes.

**Final Answer: Yes**
