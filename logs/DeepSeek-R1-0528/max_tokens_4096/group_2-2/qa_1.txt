*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is an elephant heavier than a blue whale?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that elephants are large land animals, and blue whales are the largest animals on Earth. But I should confirm the average weights.

Let me recall the weight of an African elephant, which is the largest species of elephant. Adult male African elephants can weigh up to 6,000 to 14,000 pounds. I should use metric units for accuracy, but since the question doesn't specify, I'll use what's common. Pounds or kilograms, but I'll convert if needed.

Standard weights:

- African elephant: Males weigh between 5,000 to 14,000 kg (about 11,000 to 31,000 pounds).

I think I have the range, but I need average or typical weights.

Similarly, for blue whales: Blue whales are the heaviest animals known. An adult blue whale can weigh up to 200,000 kg or more.

Let me get specific numbers.

From my knowledge:

- The average weight of an adult male African elephant is about 6,000 kg (13,000 pounds).

- The largest elephants might be around 10,000 kg, but that's rare.

Now for blue whales:

- Blue whales can weigh from 100,000 to 150,000 kg on average, and up to 180,000 kg or more for large individuals.

I remember that a blue whale's heart alone can weigh as much as a small car, about 400 kg, which is huge.

But to compare:

Maximum recorded weights:

- Elephant: The heaviest elephant recorded was about 10,400 kg (22,928 pounds) for an African elephant.

- Blue whale: The heaviest blue whale recorded was about 173,000 kg (381,400 pounds). I think there are reports of even larger, but let's stick with reliable data.

Average weights:

- African elephant: 4,500 to 6,800 kg for females, 6,000 to 8,000 kg for males. Let's say around 6,000 kg for comparison.

- Blue whale: Average is about 100,000 to 150,000 kg. I think 140,000 kg is a common figure.

So, 6,000 kg vs 140,000 kg. That's a big difference.

Elephants are heavy, but blue whales are much heavier.

I think there's no comparison; blue whales are significantly heavier.

But let me double-check with sources, since this is a reasoning exercise, I should recall accurately.

I know that:

- The largest land animal is the African elephant, weighing up to 7 tons (which is about 7,000 kg).

- Blue whales weigh up to 200 tons, which is 200,000 kg.

1 ton is 1,000 kg, so 7 tons = 7,000 kg, 200 tons = 200,000 kg.

So, 7,000 kg vs 200,000 kg, meaning a blue whale is about 28 times heavier than an elephant at maximum weights.

Even at average, say elephant 5,000 kg, blue whale 100,000 kg, that's 20 times heavier.

Therefore, an elephant is not heavier than a blue whale; in fact, it's much lighter.

The question is: "Is an elephant heavier than a blue whale?" So, based on this, the answer should be no.

But let's make sure about the weights.

I recall that there are different species: African bush elephant is the largest, and blue whale is the largest whale.

Also, Asian elephants are smaller, about 3,000 to 6,000 kg, so even lighter.

Blue whales are marine mammals, and their size is supported by water, but weight is mass times gravity, so it's absolute, not affected by buoyancy for comparison.

Weight is a measure of mass, so we're comparing masses.

So, no doubt.

Perhaps the question is tricky? Like, is there a small elephant or something, but no, it's general.

Or maybe a baby elephant vs adult blue whale, but that doesn't make sense; we compare adults.

So, I think it's clear.

Final answer should be No.

But the user said "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer."

So, I'll outline:

Step 1: Identify the animals in question: African elephant (as the heaviest elephant species) and blue whale.

Step 2: Recall typical weight ranges.

- African elephant: Adult males weigh between 5,000 to 8,000 kg, with maximum around 10,000 kg.

- Blue whale: Adult blue whales weigh between 100,000 to 150,000 kg, with maximum around 180,000 kg.

Step 3: Compare the weights.

- Even the heaviest elephant (10,000 kg) is lighter than the lightest adult blue whale (around 100,000 kg).

- The average weight of an elephant is about 6,000 kg, while blue whale is about 140,000 kg, so blue whale is over 20 times heavier.

Step 4: Conclude that an elephant is not heavier than a blue whale; in fact, a blue whale is much heavier.

Therefore, the answer is No.

Final answer: No

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

To determine whether an elephant is heavier than a blue whale, I will compare the typical weights of the largest species of each animal. The African elephant is the largest land animal and the heaviest elephant species, while the blue whale is the largest animal on Earth. I'll use metric units (kilograms) for accuracy, as weight is an absolute measure of mass.

1. **Identify the relevant species and their weight ranges:**
   - **African elephant (Loxodonta africana):** This is the heaviest elephant species. Adult males typically weigh between 4,500 kg and 6,800 kg, with exceptional individuals reaching up to 10,000 kg. The average weight for a large adult male is about 6,000 kg.
   - **Blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus):** This is the largest and heaviest animal known to have existed. Adult blue whales typically weigh between 100,000 kg and 150,000 kg, with the largest recorded individuals reaching up to 180,000 kg or more. The average weight is about 140,000 kg.

2. **Compare the weight ranges:**
   - The maximum recorded weight for an African elephant is approximately 10,000 kg (based on historical records like the famous "giant" elephant from Angola).
   - The minimum typical weight for an adult blue whale is around 100,000 kg (for smaller or younger adults).
   - Even the heaviest elephant ever recorded (10,000 kg) is significantly lighter than the lightest adult blue whale (100,000 kg). In fact, a blue whale is at least 10 times heavier than the largest elephant in direct comparison.

3. **Consider averages for a fair comparison:**
   - Average African elephant weight: ~6,000 kg.
   - Average blue whale weight: ~140,000 kg.
   - This means the average blue whale is over 23 times heavier than the average African elephant.

4. **Address any potential misconceptions:**
   - Some might confuse size with weight, but weight (mass) is the key factor here. Elephants are large for land animals, but blue whales benefit from the buoyancy of water, allowing them to grow much larger without the constraints of gravity. However, this does not affect the absolute weight comparison.
   - Asian elephants are smaller (average 3,000â€“5,000 kg) and would be even lighter than blue whales.
   - Comparing juveniles or calves would not be relevant, as the question implies adult animals.

**Conclusion:** Based on the weight data, an elephant is not heavier than a blue whale. In all cases, even the largest elephant is vastly outweighed by a blue whale.

**Final Answer: No**
