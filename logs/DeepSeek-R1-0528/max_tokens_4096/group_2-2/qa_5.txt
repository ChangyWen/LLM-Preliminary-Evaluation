*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Australia larger in area than Russia?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Russia is the largest country in the world by land area, and Australia is also a large country, but I'm not sure if it's bigger than Russia. Let me recall the approximate areas.

Russia's area is about 17 million square kilometers. I think it's 17,098,246 square kilometers to be precise, but I can use a rounded figure for comparison.

Australia's area is around 7.7 million square kilometers. I think it's 7,692,024 square kilometers or something like that. Let me make sure.

Actually, Australia includes the island of Tasmania and other territories, but the main land area is about 7.7 million km². I should confirm the exact figures.

Since this is a reasoning process, I can use general knowledge. Russia spans across Europe and Asia, and it's huge. Australia is a continent-country, but it's smaller than Asia or other continents.

Let me think about the rankings. The top countries by area are:

1. Russia

2. Canada

3. China

4. United States

5. Brazil

And then Australia is 6th, I think. Yes, Australia is the sixth largest country.

So, Russia is first, Australia is sixth, so Russia is larger.

But to be thorough, let's compare the numbers.

Russia: approximately 17.1 million km²

Australia: approximately 7.7 million km²

Now, 17.1 is more than double 7.7. 7.7 times 2 is 15.4, and 17.1 > 15.4, so Russia is significantly larger.

I should consider if there's any trick here. For example, does the question include only land area or also water bodies? Typically, when we say area of a country, it's total land area, including inland water bodies but not territorial waters.

Russia has a lot of land, and Australia has deserts and such, but still, the numbers are clear.

Another thing: sometimes people might think of Australia as a continent, but as a country, it's just the mainland and islands like Tasmania.

The continent of Australia includes Papua New Guinea and parts of Indonesia, but the country Australia is smaller.

No, the country Australia is defined, and it's about 7.7 million km².

Russia includes Siberia and all that, which is vast.

I can think about the population too, but that's not relevant to area.

So, numerically, 17 million vs 7.7 million, so Russia is larger.

Therefore, Australia is not larger than Russia.

The question is: "Is Australia larger in area than Russia?" So, the answer should be no.

But let me double-check the areas to be sure.

I recall: Russia - 17,098,242 km²

Australia - 7,692,024 km²

Source: I think this is from CIA World Factbook or something, but since I'm an AI, I can access this knowledge.

In this context, I should just reason with common knowledge.

17 million > 7.7 million, so no, Australia is not larger.

Perhaps the question is about only certain parts, but it says "area," so total land area.

Another angle: does Russia include Crimea? But that doesn't change much; it's still huge.

Similarly, Australia's territories like Christmas Island are small.

So, no issue.

Therefore, my reasoning leads to the conclusion that Australia is smaller than Russia.

Final answer: No.

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

So, I need to present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question is whether Australia is larger in area than Russia. I need to compare the total land areas of both countries, including their main territories and islands.

2. **Recall Key Area Figures**: 
   - Russia is the largest country in the world by land area. Its total area is approximately 17.1 million square kilometers (specifically, 17,098,246 km² according to standard sources like the CIA World Factbook).
   - Australia is the sixth-largest country by land area. Its total area is approximately 7.7 million square kilometers (specifically, 7,692,024 km², including Tasmania and other offshore islands).

3. **Numerical Comparison**: 
   - Russia's area: ~17,100,000 km²
   - Australia's area: ~7,700,000 km²
   - Direct comparison: 17,100,000 > 7,700,000. This means Russia is more than twice as large as Australia (since 7,700,000 × 2 = 15,400,000, and 17,100,000 > 15,400,000).

4. **Consider Context**: 
   - Land area figures typically include all land and inland water bodies but exclude territorial waters. Both countries' areas are well-established and internationally recognized.
   - Russia spans Europe and Asia, covering a vast expanse, while Australia is a continent-country but significantly smaller.
   - No significant territorial disputes or changes (e.g., Crimea for Russia or external territories for Australia) alter the basic comparison enough to affect the outcome.

5. **Final Decision**: Based on the area figures, Russia is larger than Australia. Therefore, Australia is not larger than Russia.

**Final Answer: No**
