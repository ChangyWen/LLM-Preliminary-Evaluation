*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the boiling point of water lower than the melting point of ice?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the boiling point and melting point are both temperatures, but they refer to different phase changes.

The melting point of ice is the temperature at which ice (solid water) turns into liquid water. For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, that's 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

The boiling point of water is the temperature at which liquid water turns into steam (gas). For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, that's 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

Now, comparing the two: 0 degrees Celsius for melting and 100 degrees Celsius for boiling. Clearly, 100 is greater than 0, so the boiling point is higher than the melting point.

The question asks if the boiling point is lower than the melting point. Based on these numbers, boiling point is 100°C, melting point is 0°C, so boiling point is not lower; it's higher.

But let me make sure about the context. Is there any condition where this might not be true? For example, under different pressures, these points can change.

For instance, at higher altitudes, atmospheric pressure is lower, so the boiling point of water decreases. For example, on Mount Everest, water boils at around 70°C. But the melting point of ice also changes with pressure, but not as dramatically.

The melting point of ice decreases with increasing pressure, but only slightly. For example, at very high pressures, ice can melt at lower temperatures. But under normal conditions, we're talking about standard pressure.

The question doesn't specify pressure, so I think we should assume standard atmospheric pressure, which is 1 atmosphere.

At 1 atm:

- Melting point of ice: 0°C

- Boiling point of water: 100°C

Therefore, boiling point (100°C) > melting point (0°C), so boiling point is not lower than melting point.

The question is: "Is the boiling point lower?" So, is 100 lower than 0? No, it's higher.

Perhaps in some other scale, like Kelvin. Let's convert to Kelvin to be thorough.

0°C is 273.15 K, 100°C is 373.15 K. Still, 373.15 > 273.15, so boiling point is higher.

In Fahrenheit: 32°F for melting, 212°F for boiling. 212 > 32, same thing.

So, under all these, boiling point is always higher than melting point for water under normal conditions.

But is there any substance where boiling point is lower than melting point? That would be unusual because typically, for most substances, the solid phase melts to liquid, and liquid boils to gas, so melting point should be lower than boiling point.

In fact, if boiling point were lower than melting point, that would imply that the substance goes directly from solid to gas without becoming liquid, which is sublimation. But for water, that's not the case under standard conditions; water has a liquid phase between solid and gas.

For example, dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, so its "boiling point" isn't defined in the same way, or rather, its triple point is such that it doesn't have a liquid phase at standard pressure.

But for water, at standard pressure, it has a well-defined liquid phase.

So, specifically for water, boiling point is higher than melting point.

Therefore, the answer should be no, the boiling point is not lower than the melting point.

The question is: "Is the boiling point of water lower than the melting point of ice?" Based on reasoning, no.

Final answer: No.

But let me phrase it correctly. The question asks for a Yes or No answer to whether it is lower.

So, is it lower? No.

Perhaps I should state it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the key terms**:  
   - The **melting point of ice** is the temperature at which solid water (ice) transitions to liquid water.  
   - The **boiling point of water** is the temperature at which liquid water transitions to water vapor (steam).  

2. **Standard reference conditions**:  
   - Both points are typically defined at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.325 kPa).  
   - Under these conditions, the melting point of ice is **0°C (32°F or 273.15 K)**.  
   - Under the same conditions, the boiling point of water is **100°C (212°F or 373.15 K)**.  

3. **Numerical comparison**:  
   - Convert both values to the same scale for clarity (using Celsius as standard):  
     - Melting point: 0°C  
     - Boiling point: 100°C  
   - Compare: 100°C (boiling point) vs. 0°C (melting point).  
   - Since 100°C is greater than 0°C, the boiling point is higher than the melting point.  

4. **Consider pressure effects**:  
   - Pressure can affect both points, but under standard conditions (1 atm), the relationship holds.  
   - For example, at lower pressures (e.g., high altitudes), the boiling point decreases (e.g., to ~70°C on Mount Everest), but the melting point changes minimally (still around 0°C). Even in such cases, the boiling point (e.g., 70°C) remains higher than the melting point (0°C).  
   - At extremely high pressures, the melting point of ice decreases slightly (e.g., to -22°C at 2,500 atm), but the boiling point increases significantly (e.g., to over 300°C at high pressures). Thus, the boiling point never falls below the melting point for water.  

5. **General principle for substances**:  
   - For most substances, including water, the melting point is lower than the boiling point because energy must be added to transition from solid to liquid to gas. If the boiling point were lower, it would imply sublimation (solid to gas directly), which water does not exhibit under standard conditions.  

6. **Conclusion**:  
   - Based on the comparison at standard pressure and the behavior of water, the boiling point of water is **not lower** than the melting point of ice—it is higher.  

**Final Answer: No**
