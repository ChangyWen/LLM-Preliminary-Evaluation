First, the question is: "Is the wavelength of blue light longer than that of red light?" I need to answer with a step-by-step reasoning process and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I recall that visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. Red light and blue light are both in this spectrum.

From memory, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light. Let me think about the order of colors in the rainbow or the visible spectrum. It's often remembered by the acronym ROYGBIV: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. Red is on one end with the longest wavelength, and violet is on the other end with the shortest wavelength.

So, in the visible spectrum, wavelengths increase from violet to red. Violet has the shortest wavelength, and red has the longest.

Confirming the approximate wavelengths:

- Red light has wavelengths around 620-750 nanometers.

- Blue light has wavelengths around 450-495 nanometers.

Yes, red light wavelengths are longer; for example, 700 nm for red compared to 450 nm for blue. 700 nm is greater than 450 nm, so red has a longer wavelength.

Therefore, blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light. So, the wavelength of blue light is not longer; it's shorter.

The question is: "Is the wavelength of blue light longer than that of red light?" Based on this, it should be no.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Visible light consists of different colors with different wavelengths.

2. The order of colors from longest to shortest wavelength is: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.

3. Red light has the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum.

4. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light.

5. Therefore, the wavelength of blue light is not longer than that of red light; it is shorter.

Final answer should be No.

I should also mention the actual wavelength ranges for clarity.

- Wavelength of red light: approximately 620-750 nm

- Wavelength of blue light: approximately 450-495 nm

Since 450-495 nm is less than 620-750 nm, blue light has shorter wavelengths.

So, no, blue light does not have a longer wavelength than red light.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Electromagnetic Spectrum**: Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. The visible spectrum ranges from approximately 380 nanometers (nm) to 750 nm.

2. **Wavelength Ranges for Colors**:
   - Red light has wavelengths in the range of approximately **620–750 nm**.
   - Blue light has wavelengths in the range of approximately **450–495 nm**.

3. **Compare the Wavelengths**:
   - The shortest wavelength in the red light range is about 620 nm.
   - The longest wavelength in the blue light range is about 495 nm.
   - Since 495 nm (blue) is less than 620 nm (red), blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light.

4. **Order of Colors**: In the visible spectrum, colors are ordered from longest to shortest wavelength as follows: red (longest), orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet (shortest). This confirms that red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the wavelength ranges and the order of the spectrum, the wavelength of blue light is not longer than that of red light—it is shorter.

**Final Answer: No**
