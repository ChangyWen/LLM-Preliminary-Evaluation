*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, I need to determine the death years of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. Then, I can compare those years to see who died later.

I recall that Isaac Newton was a physicist and mathematician from the 17th and 18th centuries. He was born in 1643 and died in 1727. I should confirm that.

Actually, Newton was born on December 25, 1642, according to the Julian calendar, which was used in England at the time. But in the Gregorian calendar, it's January 4, 1643. However, for death year, it's usually given as 1727. He died on March 20, 1727 (Gregorian calendar) or March 31, 1727 (Julian), but the year is 1727.

Now, Albert Einstein: he was born in 1879 and died in 1955. I think he died on April 18, 1955.

So, Newton died in 1727, and Einstein died in 1955.

To compare: 1727 vs. 1955. Clearly, 1955 is later than 1727.

Since the question is "did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?", that would mean if Newton died after Einstein, which is not the case.

The question: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?"

"Later than" means after, so if Newton died after Einstein, the answer would be yes. But Newton died in 1727, Einstein in 1955, so Newton died before Einstein, not after.

Therefore, Newton did not die later than Einstein; Einstein died later.

So, the answer should be no.

But let me double-check the dates to be sure.

Isaac Newton:

- Born: January 4, 1643 (Gregorian), but often cited as 1642 in some contexts. Death: March 31, 1727 (Julian) or March 20, 1727 (Gregorian). Year: 1727.

Albert Einstein:

- Born: March 14, 1879

- Died: April 18, 1955

So, death years: Newton 1727, Einstein 1955.

1727 < 1955, so Newton died earlier.

Therefore, Newton did not die later than Einstein.

The question is: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?"

Since Newton died first, the answer is no.

I should phrase it clearly.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the death year of Isaac Newton: 1727.

2. Identify the death year of Albert Einstein: 1955.

3. Compare the years: 1727 is less than 1955, meaning Newton died before Einstein.

4. Therefore, Newton did not die later than Einstein; Einstein died later.

5. Final answer: No.

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

So, I need to present it step by step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Isaac Newton's death year:**  
   Isaac Newton, the English physicist and mathematician, died on March 31, 1727 (according to the Julian calendar, which was used in England at the time). In the modern Gregorian calendar, this corresponds to March 20, 1727. The key point is that the year of death is 1727.

2. **Identify Albert Einstein's death year:**  
   Albert Einstein, the German-born theoretical physicist, died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, USA. This date is well-documented in the Gregorian calendar, which is the standard calendar used today. The year of death is 1955.

3. **Compare the death years:**  
   - Newton died in 1727.  
   - Einstein died in 1955.  
   Since 1727 is numerically less than 1955, this means Newton died before Einstein. Therefore, Newton did not die later than Einstein; Einstein died later.

4. **Answer the question directly:**  
   The question asks: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?"  
   - "Later than" means after in time.  
   - Since Newton died in 1727 and Einstein died in 1955, Newton died 228 years before Einstein. Thus, it is not true that Newton died later than Einstein.

**Final Answer:** No
