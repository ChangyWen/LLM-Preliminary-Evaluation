*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. It ranges from 0 to 14. A pH less than 7 is acidic, pH 7 is neutral, and pH greater than 7 is basic.

Water is neutral, so its pH is 7. That's standard for pure water at 25°C.

Lemon juice is acidic because it contains citric acid. I think lemon juice has a pH around 2 or 3. Let me recall: yes, lemon juice is quite acidic, typically between pH 2 and 3.

If water has a pH of 7 and lemon juice has a pH around 2-3, then lemon juice has a lower pH than water because lower pH means more acidic.

The question is: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?" So, if water's pH is 7 and lemon juice's pH is, say, 2.5, then water's pH is higher, not lower.

Let's read carefully: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?"

- pH of water: 7

- pH of lemon juice: approximately 2 to 3

Since 7 is greater than 2-3, the pH of water is higher than that of lemon juice. Therefore, it is not lower.

So, the answer should be No.

But let me confirm the pH values.

Pure water has a pH of 7 at 25°C. That's standard.

Lemon juice: I think it's about 2.0 to 2.6 or something like that. Yes, it's acidic due to citric acid.

For example, vinegar has a pH around 2.5-3, and lemon juice is similar.

So, lemon juice pH < water pH.

Therefore, water pH is not lower; it's higher.

The question asks if water pH is lower than lemon juice pH. Since lemon juice pH is lower, water pH is not lower.

So, answer is No.

Now, I need to show step-by-step reasoning.

Step 1: Recall that pH measures acidity. Lower pH means more acidic, higher pH means more basic.

Step 2: Pure water is neutral with a pH of 7.

Step 3: Lemon juice is acidic because it contains acids like citric acid.

Step 4: Typical pH of lemon juice is between 2 and 3.

Step 5: Compare the values: pH of water is 7, pH of lemon juice is about 2.5 (average).

Since 7 > 2.5, pH of water is higher than pH of lemon juice.

Therefore, pH of water is not lower than that of lemon juice.

Final answer: No.

The question says "lower than", so we need to say if it's true or false.

Is it true that pH of water is lower? No, it's false.

So, answer is No.

I think that's clear.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand pH**: pH is a scale from 0 to 14 that measures how acidic or basic a solution is. A pH of 7 is neutral (like pure water), values below 7 are acidic, and values above 7 are basic. Lower pH indicates higher acidity.

2. **pH of Water**: Pure water at 25°C has a pH of 7.0, as it is neutral and neither acidic nor basic. This is a standard scientific fact.

3. **pH of Lemon Juice**: Lemon juice is acidic due to the presence of citric acid and other organic acids. The typical pH range for lemon juice is between 2.0 and 3.0, with an average around 2.5. This is well-established in chemistry and food science.

4. **Comparison**:
   - Water pH: 7.0
   - Lemon juice pH: ~2.5 (average)
   - Since 7.0 is greater than 2.5, the pH of water is higher than the pH of lemon juice.

5. **Answer the Question**: The question asks, "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?" Based on the comparison:
   - pH of water (7.0) is not lower than pH of lemon juice (~2.5); it is higher.
   - Therefore, the statement is false.

**Final Answer: No**
