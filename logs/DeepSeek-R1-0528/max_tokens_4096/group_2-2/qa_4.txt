*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Does Canada have a larger population than the United States?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the United States has a much larger population than Canada. But I should recall the actual numbers to be accurate.

Let me think about the population figures. As of my last knowledge update, which is around 2023, the population of the United States is approximately 331 million people. For Canada, it's around 38 million people. I should confirm these numbers.

I remember that the U.S. population is over 330 million, and Canada's is about 37-38 million. Yes, that sounds right.

To be precise, let's use reliable sources. According to the World Bank or United Nations data:

- United States population: roughly 331 million as of 2020, and it has grown since then, but let's say about 335 million for 2023.

- Canada population: about 38 million as of 2021, and similarly, around 39 million in 2023.

But I don't need exact numbers; I just need to compare them. Clearly, 331 million vs. 38 million means the U.S. is much larger.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the populations:
   - United States: I recall the U.S. Census Bureau reported around 331.4 million in 2020. For 2023, estimates are about 336 million.
   - Canada: Statistics Canada reported approximately 38 million in 2021. For 2023, it might be around 39 million.

2. Compare the numbers:
   - U.S. population: ~336 million
   - Canada population: ~39 million
   - Therefore, 336 million > 39 million, so the United States has a larger population.

3. Is Canada larger? No, because 39 million is less than 336 million.

The question is: "Does Canada have a larger population?" So, since Canada's population is smaller, the answer should be no.

But let me double-check to be thorough. Is there any point in history where Canada had a larger population? I don't think so. The U.S. has always been more populous since both became countries.

Another way: land area. Canada is larger in land area than the U.S., but that's not population. Population is about people, not size.

So, no confusion there.

Final answer should be No, Canada does not have a larger population than the United States.

The question asks for step-by-step reasoning and final answer (Yes or No).

So, reasoning:
- Step 1: Recall that the United States has a population of approximately 336 million people.
- Step 2: Recall that Canada has a population of approximately 39 million people.
- Step 3: Compare 336 million to 39 million; since 336 > 39, the United States has a larger population.
- Step 4: Therefore, Canada does not have a larger population than the United States.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether Canada has a larger population than the United States. To answer this, I need to compare the most recent reliable population estimates for both countries.

2. **Source of Data**: Population figures are typically sourced from official government agencies like Statistics Canada and the U.S. Census Bureau, or international organizations like the United Nations. I'll use the latest available data (as of 2023).

3. **Population of Canada**: 
   - According to Statistics Canada, the estimated population of Canada in 2023 was approximately **38.9 million** (or 38,900,000) people.
   - This is based on real-time population clocks and official estimates from sources like Statistics Canada's demographic reports.

4. **Population of the United States**:
   - According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the estimated population of the United States in 2023 was approximately **336 million** (or 336,000,000) people.
   - This figure comes from the Census Bureau's population clock and is widely cited in official reports.

5. **Direct Comparison**:
   - Canada: 38.9 million
   - United States: 336 million
   - Comparing these numbers: 38.9 million is significantly smaller than 336 million. In numerical terms, 38,900,000 < 336,000,000.

6. **Conclusion on Population Size**: Since 38.9 million (Canada) is less than 336 million (United States), Canada does not have a larger population than the United States. In fact, the U.S. population is about 8.6 times larger than Canada's.

### Final Answer:
No
