*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the atomic number of carbon higher than that of oxygen?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus. It defines the element. So, I need to recall the atomic numbers for carbon and oxygen.

Carbon is an element, and I know its symbol is C. Oxygen is O. I think carbon has an atomic number of 6, and oxygen has 8. Let me confirm that.

Yes, in the periodic table, elements are ordered by atomic number. Hydrogen is 1, helium is 2, lithium is 3, beryllium is 4, boron is 5, carbon is 6, nitrogen is 7, oxygen is 8, and so on.

So, carbon: atomic number 6.

Oxygen: atomic number 8.

Now, the question is: is the atomic number of carbon higher than that of oxygen? Higher means greater than. So, is 6 greater than 8? No, 6 is less than 8.

Therefore, the atomic number of carbon is not higher than that of oxygen; it's lower.

Let me make sure I didn't mix them up. Carbon comes before oxygen in the periodic table, so carbon has a lower atomic number.

Atomic number increases from left to right and top to bottom in the periodic table. Carbon is in period 2, group 14, and oxygen is in period 2, group 16. So yes, carbon is before oxygen, so atomic number 6 vs. 8.

I can think of it numerically: 6 < 8, so carbon has a smaller atomic number.

The question is: "is it higher?" Higher would mean larger number. So, no, carbon's atomic number is not higher; oxygen's is higher.

Final answer should be No.

The question says: "Show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

So, I need to present the reasoning clearly.

Step-by-step:

1. Recall that atomic number is the number of protons in an atom.

2. Identify the atomic number of carbon: 6.

3. Identify the atomic number of oxygen: 8.

4. Compare the two: 6 vs. 8.

5. Since 6 is less than 8, the atomic number of carbon is not higher than that of oxygen.

6. Therefore, the answer is No.

The question is phrased as "Is the atomic number of carbon higher than that of oxygen?" So, if it's not higher, the answer is No.

I should be precise.

Final answer: No.

But let me double-check the atomic numbers to be thorough.

I know that carbon has 6 protons, oxygen has 8. For example, carbon dioxide is CO2, which has one carbon and two oxygen atoms, but that doesn't directly give atomic numbers, but it confirms that oxygen is heavier, which relates to atomic mass, but atomic number is specifically protons.

Atomic mass is different; carbon-12 has mass 12, oxygen-16 has mass 16, but atomic number is protons only.

So, no issue there.

Periodic table confirmation: Carbon is element 6, oxygen is element 8.

Yes.

So, reasoning:

- Atomic number of carbon: 6

- Atomic number of oxygen: 8

- 6 is less than 8, so carbon has a lower atomic number.

- Therefore, the atomic number of carbon is not higher than that of oxygen.

Answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand Atomic Number**: The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of its atom. It uniquely identifies the element and determines its position in the periodic table.

2. **Recall Atomic Number of Carbon**: Carbon is a chemical element with the symbol "C". Its atomic number is 6, meaning it has 6 protons. This is a standard value from the periodic table.

3. **Recall Atomic Number of Oxygen**: Oxygen is a chemical element with the symbol "O". Its atomic number is 8, meaning it has 8 protons. This is also a standard value from the periodic table.

4. **Compare the Atomic Numbers**: 
   - Carbon's atomic number: 6
   - Oxygen's atomic number: 8
   - Since 6 is less than 8, carbon has a lower atomic number than oxygen.

5. **Answer the Question**: The question asks if the atomic number of carbon is higher than that of oxygen. Based on the comparison, carbon's atomic number (6) is not higher than oxygen's (8); it is lower.

### Final Answer:
No
