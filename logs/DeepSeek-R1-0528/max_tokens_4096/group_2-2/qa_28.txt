*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is an eagle faster than a peregrine falcon?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that peregrine falcons are known for being the fastest birds in the world, especially when they dive. They can reach speeds over 200 miles per hour during a stoop (a high-speed dive).

Now, eagles are also birds of prey, but they're not typically known for that kind of speed. Eagles like the bald eagle or golden eagle are powerful and can fly fast, but not as fast as peregrine falcons in a dive. I think eagles might reach speeds around 100-150 miles per hour in a dive, but I'm not entirely sure. I should recall specific facts.

Let me think about the top speeds:

- Peregrine falcon: I've heard they can go up to 240 mph or even more in a dive. The commonly cited figure is around 242 mph.

- Eagles: For example, the golden eagle might dive at speeds up to 150-200 mph, but it's less than the peregrine. I think the golden eagle is one of the faster eagles, but still not as fast as the peregrine.

I remember that peregrine falcons hold the record for the fastest animal on the planet when considering diving speed. Eagles are fast, but they don't match that.

What about level flight? The question doesn't specify if it's diving speed or level flight speed. It just says "faster," so I should consider both.

In level flight, peregrine falcons can fly at about 60-70 mph, and eagles might be similar or a bit slower. For instance, a bald eagle's cruising speed is around 30-40 mph, but they can go faster when needed.

But the peregrine is still faster in level flight compared to most eagles. Peregrines are built for speed with their streamlined bodies.

Let me look for some reliable sources in my knowledge:

- According to National Geographic or other wildlife sources, peregrine falcons are the fastest birds.

- Eagles are more known for their strength and size, not pure speed.

Specifically for eagles:

- Golden eagle: Diving speed up to 150-200 mph, but average is less.

- Bald eagle: Diving speed around 100 mph, cruising at 30-40 mph.

Peregrine falcon: Diving up to 240 mph, level flight up to 60-70 mph.

So in both diving and level flight, the peregrine falcon is faster than most eagles.

Is there any eagle that might be faster? I think not. The peregrine is generally accepted as the fastest.

The question says "an eagle" – it could be any eagle, but I think in general, eagles are not faster than peregrine falcons.

Perhaps I should consider the fastest eagle. The golden eagle is often cited as one of the fastest eagles.

But even then, the peregrine falcon is faster.

I recall that in the animal kingdom, the peregrine falcon is the fastest bird, and no eagle surpasses it.

Final answer should be no, an eagle is not faster than a peregrine falcon.

But let me confirm with numbers.

From memory:

- Peregrine falcon dive: 200-240 mph

- Golden eagle dive: 120-150 mph (some sources say up to 200, but that's rare)

- Bald eagle dive: 75-100 mph

Level flight:

- Peregrine: 40-60 mph cruising, up to 70 in chase

- Bald eagle: 20-40 mph cruising

- Golden eagle: similar or slightly faster.

But peregrine is faster in both aspects.

So, step by step:

1. Identify what is being compared: speed of an eagle vs. peregrine falcon.

2. Consider types of speed: diving speed and level flight speed.

3. Diving speed: Peregrine falcon is the fastest bird, with recorded speeds over 200 mph. Eagles, like golden eagle, can reach high speeds but typically less than peregrine.

4. Level flight: Peregrine falcon has a higher cruising and chasing speed than most eagles.

5. Conclusion: In general, no eagle is faster than a peregrine falcon; the peregrine is faster.

Therefore, the answer is no.

The question is: "Is an eagle faster than a peregrine falcon?" So, if the answer is no, that means the eagle is not faster, which is correct.

Final answer: No.

But to be precise, I should say that peregrine falcon is faster than any eagle.

Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks if an eagle is faster than a peregrine falcon. This requires comparing the speeds of these birds. Speed can refer to either level flight (cruising or chasing) or diving (stooping) speeds, as both are relevant for birds of prey.

2. **Identify Key Species**:
   - Eagles: There are many species (e.g., bald eagle, golden eagle), but none are known for being the absolute fastest birds. The golden eagle is often considered one of the fastest eagles.
   - Peregrine Falcon: This bird is widely recognized as the fastest animal on Earth in a dive, and it is also very fast in level flight compared to other birds.

3. **Compare Diving Speeds**:
   - Peregrine Falcon: During a high-speed dive (stoop), it can reach speeds of **200–240 mph (320–390 km/h)**. This is the highest reliably measured speed for any bird or animal.
   - Eagles: Golden eagles, which are among the fastest eagles, can dive at speeds up to **150–200 mph (240–320 km/h)** in rare cases, but typical dives are slower (around 120–150 mph). Bald eagles are slower, with diving speeds of about **75–100 mph (120–160 km/h)**.
   - **Conclusion for Diving**: The peregrine falcon is significantly faster than any eagle in a dive. Even the fastest eagle (golden eagle) does not consistently match the peregrine's top speeds.

4. **Compare Level Flight Speeds**:
   - Peregrine Falcon: In level flight, it can cruise at **40–60 mph (65–100 km/h)** and reach bursts of **60–70 mph (95–110 km/h)** when chasing prey.
   - Eagles: Golden eagles cruise at about **30–50 mph (50–80 km/h)**, with bursts up to **80 mph (130 km/h)** in exceptional cases. Bald eagles are slower, cruising at **20–40 mph (30–65 km/h)**.
   - **Conclusion for Level Flight**: The peregrine falcon is generally faster in level flight than most eagles, including the golden eagle. Eagles are built for endurance and power, not pure speed, so they are slower in direct comparisons.

5. **Overall Comparison**:
   - The peregrine falcon holds the title of the world's fastest bird due to its incredible diving speed, and it also outperforms eagles in level flight.
   - No species of eagle has been recorded as faster than the peregrine falcon in any speed category. Scientific sources (e.g., National Geographic, Guinness World Records) consistently rank the peregrine falcon as faster.

**Final Answer: No**  
An eagle is not faster than a peregrine falcon. The peregrine falcon is faster in both diving and level flight.
