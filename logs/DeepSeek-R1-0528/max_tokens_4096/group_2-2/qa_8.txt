*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the Gobi Desert hotter than the Sahara Desert?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that both are deserts, but they are in different parts of the world. The Sahara is in North Africa, and the Gobi is in Asia, covering parts of northern China and southern Mongolia.

Deserts can have different temperature profiles based on factors like latitude, altitude, proximity to oceans, and other geographical features. For heat, we're probably talking about average temperatures, especially in summer, or peak temperatures.

I recall that the Sahara is often considered one of the hottest places on Earth. For example, places like Death Valley are extremely hot, but Death Valley is in the US, not the Sahara. The Sahara has recorded some of the highest temperatures ever. I think the highest recorded temperature in the Sahara is around 58°C (136°F) in Libya or Algeria.

Now, for the Gobi Desert, it's a cold desert. I remember that the Gobi can have very hot summers but also very cold winters because it's at a higher altitude and more continental. The Gobi is a high desert, with elevations ranging from about 900 to 1,500 meters above sea level. Higher altitudes generally mean cooler temperatures.

Let me compare average temperatures. I should look for reliable data on summer highs or annual averages.

First, Sahara Desert:

- Average summer temperatures can be around 38°C to 40°C (100°F to 104°F), but often exceed 45°C (113°F) in many areas.

- Record high: I think it's 58°C (136.4°F) in El Azizia, Libya, but that record was disputed and later invalidated. The current accepted highest is 56.7°C (134°F) in Death Valley, but for the Sahara, it's still very hot. Let's say typical summer highs are 45-50°C.

Now, Gobi Desert:

- Summer temperatures can reach up to 40°C (104°F) or a bit higher, but averages are lower.

- Because of its continental location and high elevation, temperatures vary more. For example, in winter, it can drop to -40°C, but we're concerned about heat.

The question is about being hotter, so I should focus on maximum temperatures or summer averages.

I think the Sahara is generally hotter. The Gobi is known for being a cold desert, meaning it has greater temperature extremes but not as high peak temperatures as the Sahara.

Let me find some specific numbers.

Upon thinking, the average July temperature in the Sahara is around 35-40°C, with highs over 45°C.

For the Gobi, in areas like Dalanzadgad in Mongolia, the average July high is around 31°C (88°F), and it can get up to 38°C (100°F) occasionally, but not consistently as high as the Sahara.

I remember that the Gobi has a higher temperature range. For instance, average summer highs might be 25-30°C, but I need to be precise.

Perhaps I should consider the hottest places in each.

In the Sahara, places like Timbuktu or Agadez can have average highs of 40°C in summer.

In the Gobi, the hottest part might be in China, like the Turpan Depression, but Turpan is not exactly in the Gobi; it's nearby. Turpan has recorded high temperatures, like 50°C, but Turpan is a separate area.

Turpan Depression is in China and has one of the highest temperatures recorded in China, around 50°C, but it's not part of the Gobi Desert. The Gobi is further east and north.

The Gobi Desert itself has lower maximum temperatures due to its elevation.

For example, Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, is near the Gobi and has short, mild summers with average highs of 23°C in July. But Ulaanbaatar is not in the desert; it's a bit cooler.

Dalanzadgad, which is in the Gobi, has an average July high of about 28°C (82°F) and low of 12°C (54°F). That seems cooler.

I think I have a misconception. Let me double-check.

Upon recollection, the Gobi Desert can have temperatures reaching 40°C in summer, but it's not as extreme as the Sahara.

The Sahara has a larger area, and parts like the Libyan Desert are extremely hot.

Moreover, the Sahara is at a lower latitude, mostly between 15°N and 30°N, while the Gobi is between 40°N and 50°N, so it's farther from the equator, meaning it gets less intense solar radiation, contributing to cooler temperatures.

Also, the Gobi's altitude: much of it is 1000m or higher, whereas the Sahara has low-lying areas like the Qattara Depression but also highlands, but on average, the Sahara is lower.

The Sahara has the Libyan Desert which is below sea level in some parts? No, I think the lowest point is the Qattara Depression at -133m, but most is above sea level.

Average elevation of Sahara is around 400-500m, I think, but with vast areas below 200m.

Gobi average elevation is 900-1500m, so significantly higher.

Higher altitude means lower temperatures, roughly 6.5°C cooler per 1000m.

So, for the Gobi at 1000m vs. Sahara at 500m, that's about 500m difference, so Gobi should be about 3-4°C cooler on average due to altitude alone, not even considering latitude.

Latitude: Sahara is subtropical, Gobi is temperate, so Sahara has higher solar insolation.

Therefore, overall, the Sahara should be hotter.

But let's confirm with actual data if I can recall.

I remember that the highest temperature recorded in the Gobi Desert is around 43°C (109°F), while in the Sahara, it's over 50°C, with places like Kebili, Tunisia, recording 55°C.

Kebili recorded 55°C, but that might be disputed. Still, reliable records show Sahara temperatures often above 50°C.

For Gobi, I think the highest is lower. For example, in Mongolia, the highest recorded temperature is 44°C in the Gobi Desert region.

Yes, that sounds right.

Moreover, average summer temperatures: In the Sahara, many stations have average July highs above 40°C, like in In Salah, Algeria, average high is 45°C in July.

For Gobi, in Dalanzadgad, Mongolia, average July high is 28°C, as I thought earlier. Let me confirm that.

I can think of Sainshand or other Gobi towns.

Perhaps in the Chinese part, like in Inner Mongolia, it might be hotter.

For instance, Erenhot in Inner Mongolia, which is in the Gobi, has an average July high of 31°C (88°F) and record high of 42.2°C (108°F).

Similarly, in the Sahara, take Cairo, but Cairo is not desert; it's on the Nile. Better to take a desert location.

Like Ouargla, Algeria: average July high 44°C (111°F), record high 51.3°C (124.3°F).

Clearly, the Sahara has higher temperatures.

Therefore, the Gobi Desert is not hotter than the Sahara; in fact, the Sahara is hotter.

But the question is: "Is the Gobi Desert hotter?" So, based on this, no.

Is there any time when Gobi is hotter? For example, in winter, Gobi is colder, but the question is about heat, so probably summer or peak temperatures.

The question doesn't specify, but in common parlance, "hotter" likely refers to high temperatures, not average annual.

Moreover, deserts are defined by aridity, not temperature, so both are deserts, but Sahara is hot desert, Gobi is cold desert.

So, generally, Sahara is hotter.

Final answer should be no.

But let's make sure there's no trick.

Perhaps in some specific locations or times, but on average, no.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the deserts: Sahara in North Africa, Gobi in East Asia.

2. Consider geographical factors: Sahara at lower latitude (15-30°N), Gobi at higher latitude (40-50°N), so Sahara receives more direct sunlight.

3. Altitude: Gobi is at higher elevation (avg 900-1500m) vs. Sahara (lower, avg around 500m, with some depressions). Higher altitude means cooler temperatures.

4. Climate type: Sahara is a subtropical hot desert, Gobi is a temperate cold desert with greater seasonal temperature variation.

5. Temperature data: 
   - Sahara: Summer average highs often above 40°C, records over 50°C.
   - Gobi: Summer average highs around 25-30°C, records around 40-45°C, lower than Sahara.

6. Therefore, the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert.

So, to the question "Is the Gobi Desert hotter than the Sahara Desert?" the answer is No.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether the Gobi Desert is hotter than the Sahara Desert. "Hotter" typically refers to higher temperatures, especially during the summer months or peak heat periods. I'll focus on average summer temperatures and record highs for a fair comparison, as these are standard metrics for assessing heat in deserts.

2. **Geographical and Climatic Context**:
   - **Sahara Desert**: Located in North Africa (mostly between 15°N and 30°N latitude), it is the world's largest hot desert. It has a subtropical climate with very high solar insolation due to its low latitude. Elevation is generally low (average around 500 meters, with some areas like depressions below sea level), contributing to intense heat. It experiences extremely hot summers with minimal temperature variation between day and night in many areas.
   - **Gobi Desert**: Located in East Asia (spanning northern China and southern Mongolia, between 40°N and 50°N latitude), it is a cold desert. It has a temperate climate with greater seasonal extremes. Elevation is higher (average 900–1,500 meters), which reduces temperatures due to the lapse rate (approximately 6.5°C cooler per 1,000 meters of elevation). Its higher latitude means less direct sunlight compared to the Sahara.

3. **Temperature Comparison**:
   - **Summer Average High Temperatures**:
     - Sahara: Average high temperatures in summer (June-August) commonly exceed 40°C (104°F) across much of the desert. For example:
       - In Salah, Algeria: Average July high of 45°C (113°F).
       - Timbuktu, Mali: Average July high of 42°C (108°F).
       - Overall, summer averages range from 38°C to 45°C (100°F to 113°F) in many regions.
     - Gobi: Average high temperatures in summer are lower due to higher elevation and latitude. For example:
       - Dalanzadgad, Mongolia (in the Gobi): Average July high of 28°C (82°F).
       - Erenhot, China (in the Gobi): Average July high of 31°C (88°F).
       - Overall, summer averages range from 25°C to 32°C (77°F to 90°F) in most parts, with some localized areas reaching up to 35°C (95°F).
     - **Conclusion**: The Sahara has consistently higher average summer temperatures by about 10–15°C (18–27°F) compared to the Gobi.
   
   - **Record High Temperatures**:
     - Sahara: Holds some of the highest recorded temperatures on Earth. Examples include:
       - 55.0°C (131°F) in Kebili, Tunisia (1931, though disputed).
       - 50.7°C (123.3°F) in Ouargla, Algeria (2018, reliable modern record).
       - Temperatures frequently exceed 50°C (122°F) in many areas during heatwaves.
     - Gobi: Record highs are lower due to climatic constraints. Examples include:
       - 43.4°C (110.1°F) in Sainshand, Mongolia (2010).
       - 42.2°C (108.0°F) in Erenhot, China.
       - Temperatures rarely exceed 45°C (113°F) and are generally capped around 40°C (104°F) in most regions.
     - **Conclusion**: The Sahara has higher peak temperatures, with records exceeding those of the Gobi by 7–12°C (12–22°F).

4. **Key Factors Influencing Heat**:
   - **Latitude**: The Sahara's lower latitude (closer to the equator) results in more direct and intense sunlight year-round, while the Gobi's higher latitude receives less solar energy.
   - **Elevation**: The Gobi's high elevation (often above 1,000 meters) causes cooler temperatures, whereas the Sahara's lower elevation amplifies heat.
   - **Climate Type**: The Sahara is classified as a "hot desert" with persistently high temperatures, while the Gobi is a "cold desert" with large diurnal and seasonal variations (very hot in summer but extremely cold in winter). For heat comparisons, the Sahara's consistent and extreme highs dominate.
   - **Continentality**: Both deserts are continental (far from oceans), but the Sahara's size and low elevation make it more prone to intense heating, while the Gobi's elevation moderates its heat.

5. **Overall Assessment**: Based on average summer temperatures, record highs, and geographical factors, the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert. The Gobi experiences cooler conditions due to its higher latitude and elevation, resulting in lower average and peak temperatures.

**Final Answer: No**
