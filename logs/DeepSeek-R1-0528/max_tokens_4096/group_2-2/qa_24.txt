*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are comparing the length of a day on Earth and a day on Venus.

 First, we need to clarify what we mean by a "day". There are two common definitions:
  1. Sidereal day: The time it takes for a planet to rotate once on its axis relative to the fixed stars.
  2. Solar day: The time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky (noon to noon), which is affected by both rotation and orbital motion.

 However, when we typically talk about a day on a planet, we often mean the solar day (the day-night cycle). But note that the question doesn't specify. Let's look at the context.

 We know that Venus has a very slow rotation and also rotates in the opposite direction (retrograde). Moreover, the solar day on Venus is actually shorter than its sidereal day because of its retrograde rotation and the fact that its orbital period is shorter than its rotational period.

 But to answer the question, we need the standard definition. Typically, when we say "a day" in the context of comparing planets, we are talking about the solar day.

 Let me recall the known data:

 Earth:
   Sidereal rotation period (sidereal day) = 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.1 seconds ≈ 86164.1 seconds.
   Solar day = 24 hours = 86400 seconds.

 Venus:
   Sidereal rotation period (the time for one rotation relative to the fixed stars) = 243 Earth days (and it's retrograde).
   Orbital period (around the Sun) = 224.7 Earth days.

 The solar day on Venus can be calculated by the formula:

   1 / (solar day) = 1 / (sidereal rotation period) - 1 / (orbital period)   [for a planet with retrograde rotation, we use subtraction because the rotation is in the opposite direction to the orbital motion? Actually, let's be careful.]

 Alternatively, the general formula for the solar day is:

   Solar day = (sidereal rotation period * orbital period) / |orbital period - sidereal rotation period|

 But note: Because Venus has a retrograde rotation, the subtraction becomes addition in the denominator? Actually, let's think:

   For a prograde rotation (like Earth), the solar day is longer than the sidereal day because the planet has to rotate a little extra to compensate for the orbital motion. The formula for prograde rotation is:

     1 / solar_day = 1 / sidereal_day - 1 / orbital_period   (if we take the orbital period as positive)

   However, for Venus, which is retrograde, we can think of its rotation as negative. So the formula becomes:

     1 / solar_day = 1 / sidereal_day + 1 / orbital_period   (if we take sidereal_day as positive and orbital_period as positive)

   But note: the sidereal rotation period of Venus is 243 days (prograde would be positive, retrograde we take as negative? or we can just use the absolute values and adjust the formula).

   Actually, the standard formula for the solar day on Venus is:

      Solar day = (1 / (1 / sidereal_rotation_period + 1 / orbital_period))   for retrograde rotation.

   Alternatively, we can compute:

      Solar day = (sidereal_rotation_period * orbital_period) / (sidereal_rotation_period + orbital_period)

   because the rotation is retrograde.

   Let me calculate:

      sidereal_rotation_period = 243 Earth days (note: this is the absolute value, but it's retrograde so we use the positive number in the formula with addition in the denominator)
      orbital_period = 224.7 Earth days

      Solar day on Venus = (243 * 224.7) / (243 + 224.7) = ?

      Calculate numerator: 243 * 224.7 ≈ 243 * 224.7 = let's compute:

          243 * 200 = 48600
          243 * 24.7 = 243 * 25 - 243 * 0.3 = 6075 - 72.9 = 6002.1
          So total numerator ≈ 48600 + 6002.1 = 54602.1

      Denominator: 243 + 224.7 = 467.7

      Solar day ≈ 54602.1 / 467.7 ≈ 116.75 Earth days.

   But wait, I recall that the solar day on Venus is about 117 Earth days? That seems very long.

   Actually, let's check with known facts: The solar day on Venus is indeed about 116.75 Earth days.

   However, note that we have:

      Earth's solar day = 1 Earth day.

   Therefore, a day on Venus (solar day) is about 116.75 Earth days, which is much longer than an Earth day.

   But wait, the question is: "Does a day on Earth last longer than a day on Venus?"

   We have:

      Day on Earth = 1 Earth day (solar day).
      Day on Venus = 116.75 Earth days (solar day).

   So clearly, a day on Venus is longer than a day on Earth. Therefore, the answer to the question is: No, a day on Earth does not last longer than a day on Venus.

   However, let me double-check with a reliable source.

   According to NASA:

      Venus: 
          Sidereal rotation period: 243.018 Earth days (retrograde)
          Orbital period: 224.701 Earth days.
          Solar day: 116.75 Earth days.

   So indeed, the solar day on Venus is 116.75 Earth days, which is longer than one Earth day.

   Therefore, a day on Earth (which is 1 Earth day) is shorter than a day on Venus (which is 116.75 Earth days).

   So the answer to the question "Does a day on Earth last longer than a day on Venus?" is No.

   But wait, let me rephrase the question: The question asks if Earth's day is longer than Venus's day. We found that Venus's day (solar day) is 116.75 Earth days, so Earth's day (1 day) is much shorter.

   Therefore, the answer is: No.

   However, note that sometimes people might confuse with the sidereal day. The sidereal day of Venus is 243 Earth days, which is even longer. But we are using the solar day as the common measure.

   Final answer: No.

   But let's make sure about the formula again:

      The formula for the solar day on a planet is:

         Solar day = 1 / | (1 / sidereal_rotation_period) ∓ (1 / orbital_period) |

      The sign depends on the direction of rotation. For prograde rotation (same as orbital motion) we subtract, for retrograde we add.

      For Venus: retrograde so we add.

         Solar day = 1 / ( (1/243) + (1/224.7) ) in Earth days.

      Let's compute:

         1/243 ≈ 0.004115226
         1/224.7 ≈ 0.004450378

         Sum ≈ 0.008565604

         Solar day ≈ 1 / 0.008565604 ≈ 116.75 Earth days.

   This confirms.

   Therefore, a day on Venus is longer than a day on Earth.

   Answer: No, a day on Earth does not last longer than a day on Venus.

   Final answer: No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether a day on Earth lasts longer than a day on Venus, we need to compare the length of a solar day for both planets. A solar day is the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky, which is the common understanding of a "day."

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Define a Solar Day**:
   - For Earth: The solar day is 24 hours, which is exactly 1 Earth day.
   - For Venus: The solar day depends on its rotation and orbital period. Venus rotates retrograde (opposite to its orbit) and has a slow rotation.

2. **Gather Data**:
   - **Earth's Solar Day**: 1 Earth day (86,400 seconds).
   - **Venus' Sidereal Rotation Period**: 243 Earth days (time for one full rotation relative to distant stars, retrograde).
   - **Venus' Orbital Period**: Approximately 224.7 Earth days (time to orbit the Sun once).

3. **Calculate Venus' Solar Day**:
   - The formula for the solar day of a planet with retrograde rotation is:
     \[
     \text{Solar Day} = \frac{\text{Sidereal Rotation Period} \times \text{Orbital Period}}{\text{Sidereal Rotation Period} + \text{Orbital Period}}
     \]
   - Plug in the values:
     \[
     \text{Solar Day}_{\text{Venus}} = \frac{243 \times 224.7}{243 + 224.7}
     \]
   - Calculate the numerator: \(243 \times 224.7 = 54,602.1\)
   - Calculate the denominator: \(243 + 224.7 = 467.7\)
   - Divide: \(\frac{54,602.1}{467.7} \approx 116.75\) Earth days.

4. **Compare the Days**:
   - Earth's solar day: **1 Earth day**.
   - Venus' solar day: **116.75 Earth days**.
   - Since 116.75 > 1, a day on Venus is longer than a day on Earth.

5. **Answer the Question**:
   - The question asks: "Does a day on Earth last longer than a day on Venus?"
   - Based on the calculation, a day on Earth (1 Earth day) is shorter than a day on Venus (116.75 Earth days). Therefore, the answer is **No**.

### Final Answer:
**No**
