*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is China located east of Japan?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that China and Japan are both countries in East Asia. China is a large country, and Japan is an island nation to the east of the Asian mainland.

Let me recall the geographical locations. China is on the mainland of Asia, and Japan is a series of islands off the eastern coast of Asia. Specifically, Japan is situated to the east of China.

For example, the East China Sea is between China and Japan, and Japan is on the eastern side of that sea. Also, the Sea of Japan is to the west of Japan, which borders Korea and Russia, but in relation to China, Japan is generally east.

China's eastern coast faces the Pacific Ocean, and Japan is located in that ocean, east of China. Major cities in China, like Shanghai, are on the east coast, and Japan is directly east of there.

I should think about coordinates. Beijing, the capital of China, is at approximately 40°N, 116°E. Tokyo, the capital of Japan, is at about 35°N, 139°E. Comparing the longitudes: Beijing is at 116°E, and Tokyo is at 139°E. Since longitude increases as you go east, Tokyo has a higher longitude number, meaning it is east of Beijing.

139°E is greater than 116°E, so yes, Tokyo is east of Beijing. Since Beijing is in northern China, and Shanghai is at around 121°E, which is still less than 139°E, so Japan is east of eastern China.

What about other parts of China? Western China, like Xinjiang, has longitudes around 75°E to 90°E, which are much further west. But the question is about China as a whole. Typically, when we say "China" in a geographical context like this, we refer to its eastern part or its position relative to neighbors.

Japan is not east of all of China; for example, parts of western China are at similar or even further east longitudes than Japan? No, Japan's easternmost point is around 145°E or so, while western China is around 75°E, so Japan is east of all of China.

Let me confirm: the westernmost point of China is near 73°E, and the easternmost point is around 135°E in Heilongjiang province. Heilongjiang is at about 135°E, and Japan's main islands start from around 129°E to 145°E. For instance, Kyushu is at about 130°E, and Hokkaido is around 141°E.

Heilongjiang, China, at 135°E, and the nearest part of Japan is Kyushu or Honshu. Kyushu is at 130°E to 132°E approximately. 130°E is less than 135°E, so Kyushu is west of Heilongjiang? That can't be right.

I think I have a mistake. Longitude: as you go east, longitude increases. So 135°E is further east than 130°E.

Let's take specific points:

- Easternmost point of China: Fuyuan, Heilongjiang, at about 134°40'E.

- Westernmost point of Japan: Yonaguni Island, Okinawa, at about 122°56'E.

Yonaguni is part of Japan and is at 122°56'E. But mainland Japan, like Tokyo, is around 139°E.

For China, Shanghai is at 121°E, and Fuyuan at 134°E.

Now, Japan's westernmost point is Yonaguni at 122°56'E, which is west of Shanghai (121°E)? 122°56'E is greater than 121°E, so Yonaguni is east of Shanghai.

122.56°E vs. 121°E: 122.56 > 121, so Yonaguni is east of Shanghai.

But Yonaguni is very close to Taiwan, which is part of China, and Taiwan is at around 121°E to 122°E, so Yonaguni is just east of Taiwan.

Taiwan's eastern coast is about 122°E, so Yonaguni at 122.93°E is slightly east of that.

But for mainland China, the eastern coast is around 120°E to 122°E for cities like Shanghai.

Japan's main islands start from Kyushu at around 130°E to 131°E, which is east of Shanghai's 121°E.

The question is about China as a whole. Since Japan has territories that are very close, like Yonaguni, which is only about 100 km east of Taiwan.

But Taiwan is part of China, so technically, China extends to about 122°E at its easternmost in Taiwan.

Japan's Yonaguni is at 122.93°E, which is east of Taiwan's 122°E.

So, Yonaguni is east of Taiwan.

Similarly, the Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands) are disputed but controlled by Japan; they are at around 123°E to 124°E, which is east of Taiwan.

But let's not get into disputes; generally, Japan is considered east of China.

From a broader perspective, on a map, China is west of Japan.

I think I'm overcomplicating this.

Standard geography: Japan is located to the east of China. For example, if you look at a map, China is on the left (west), and Japan is on the right (east) when oriented with north up.

In terms of direction, from China, you go east to reach Japan.

Similarly, from Japan, you go west to reach China.

So, Japan is east of China.

Therefore, China is west of Japan, not east of Japan.

The question is: "Is China located east of Japan?"

That means, is China positioned to the east of Japan?

From Japan's perspective, is China to the east?

No, from Japan, China is to the west.

For example, from Tokyo, China is westward, across the sea.

So, China is not east of Japan; Japan is east of China.

To be precise:

- If A is east of B, then B is west of A.

So, Japan is east of China, therefore China is west of Japan.

Hence, China is not east of Japan.

In terms of the location, China is west of Japan.

Therefore, the answer should be no.

But let's make sure about the phrasing.

" Is China located east of Japan?" – this asks if China is to the east of Japan.

Since Japan is east of China, China is west of Japan, so no.

Another way: the relative position.

I can think of the prime meridian. But both are in the eastern hemisphere.

Longitude comparison:

- Average longitude of China: roughly from 73°E to 135°E, so mean around 100°E or so.

- Japan: from about 129°E to 146°E, mean around 137°E.

137°E is east of 100°E, so Japan is east of China.

Therefore, China is west of Japan.

Thus, China is not east of Japan.

If we take specific points: the easternmost point of Japan is Minami Torishima at 153°E, but that's remote. Main islands up to 145°E.

Easternmost of China is 134°E, which is less than Japan's main islands starting from 129°E? Kyushu is 130°E, Honshu from 130°E to 140°E.

134°E in China vs. 130°E in Japan: 134°E is east of 130°E, so Fuyuan, China (134°E) is east of Kyushu, Japan (130°E).

Oh, so in that case, part of China is east of part of Japan.

Specifically, Heilongjiang province in China is at up to 135°E, and Kyushu is at 130°E to 131°E, so yes, eastern China is east of western Japan.

For example, Fuyuan at 134°E is east of Kagoshima in Kyushu at 130°E.

Longitude: higher number is further east.

134°E vs 130°E: 134 > 130, so Fuyuan is east of Kagoshima.

Therefore, China (at least this part) is east of Japan (this part).

But Japan extends further east to 145°E, so overall, Japan is east of China, but locally, some parts of China are east of some parts of Japan.

The question is about the countries as a whole. Typically, when we say "China is located east of Japan," it implies that China as a country is to the east of Japan as a country, meaning on average or in general.

But geographically, countries have overlapping longitudes in some cases.

In this case, the eastern tip of China is at 134°E, and the western tip of Japan is at 122°E for Yonaguni.

Yonaguni is at 122.93°E, and Taiwan is part of China at 122°E, so Yonaguni is east of Taiwan.

But for mainland China, Shanghai is 121°E, so Yonaguni at 122.93°E is east of Shanghai.

Similarly, the main islands of Japan start from around 129°E for Kyushu.

China's easternmost point is 134.77°E in Fuyuan, Heilongjiang.

Japan's westernmost point of main islands is Kyushu at about 129.8°E for Sasebo or something.

Let's use approximate values:

- China easternmost: ~135°E

- China westernmost: ~73°E

- Japan westernmost: Yonaguni ~123°E (if we include remote islands, but usually we consider the main territory)

- Japan easternmost: ~146°E for main islands? Hokkaido is up to 145°E.

But for relative position between the two countries.

The centroid or the capital.

Capitals: Beijing at 116.4°E, Tokyo at 139.7°E.

139.7 > 116.4, so Tokyo is east of Beijing, thus Japan is east of China.

Therefore, China is west of Japan.

Since Beijing and Tokyo are major reference points.

From a directional perspective, if you travel from Japan to China, you go west, so China is west of Japan.

Hence, China is not east of Japan.

To answer the question directly: "Is China located east of Japan?" – no, it is located west of Japan.

Therefore, the answer should be no.

But let's see if there's any trick.

Perhaps in some contexts, but I think it's clear.

Final reasoning:

1. Japan is an island nation situated to the east of the Asian continent, specifically east of China.

2. The East China Sea lies between China and Japan, with China to the west and Japan to the east.

3. Longitude comparison shows that key points in Japan have higher longitude values than key points in China, indicating Japan is east of China.

4. Therefore, China is not east of Japan; it is west of Japan.

So, the answer is no.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks whether China is located east of Japan. This requires determining the relative geographical positions of the two countries, specifically if China is positioned to the east of Japan.

2. **Recall Basic Geography**: 
   - China is a large country located on the eastern part of the Asian mainland.
   - Japan is an island nation situated in the Pacific Ocean, east of the Asian mainland.
   - The two countries are separated by bodies of water, including the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan.

3. **Compare Longitudes**: Longitude is a key factor in determining east-west positioning. Higher longitude values indicate a position further east.
   - **China's approximate longitude range**: The westernmost point is near 73°E (in Xinjiang), and the easternmost point is around 135°E (in Heilongjiang Province, near Fuyuan). Major cities like Beijing (capital) are at approximately 116°E, and Shanghai is at about 121°E.
   - **Japan's approximate longitude range**: The westernmost point is Yonaguni Island (part of Okinawa Prefecture) at about 123°E, and the easternmost point of the main islands is around 145°E (in Hokkaido). Tokyo (capital) is at approximately 140°E.
   - **Comparison**: 
     - Japan's westernmost point (Yonaguni at 123°E) is east of China's eastern coast (e.g., Shanghai at 121°E), meaning Japan starts east of China's coastal areas.
     - Japan's main islands (e.g., Kyushu at 130°E) are also east of China's easternmost point (135°E in Heilongjiang). For example, Kyushu at 130°E is west of Heilongjiang at 135°E, but this is a localized comparison and doesn't represent the overall relationship.
     - On average, Japan's longitude (centered around 135-140°E) is higher than China's (centered around 100-110°E), indicating that Japan is generally east of China.

4. **Consider Relative Positioning from a Broader Perspective**:
   - From a continental view, China is part of the Asian mainland, and Japan is an archipelago to the east, across the East China Sea. Travel from Japan to China typically heads west.
   - Standard maps and geographical references consistently place Japan east of China. For example:
     - The East China Sea is west of Japan and east of China, reinforcing that Japan is east of China.
     - If China were east of Japan, it would imply Japan is west of China, which contradicts established geography.

5. **Address Potential Edge Cases**:
   - Parts of eastern China (e.g., Heilongjiang at 135°E) are east of parts of western Japan (e.g., Kyushu at 130°E), but this is localized and does not change the overall positional relationship between the two countries.
   - When considering countries as a whole, the general position is defined by their core territories or capitals. Beijing (116°E) is west of Tokyo (140°E), confirming China is west of Japan.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on longitudinal data and standard geographical knowledge, Japan is located east of China. Therefore, China is not east of Japan; it is west of Japan.

**Final Answer: No**
