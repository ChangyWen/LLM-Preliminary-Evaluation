*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?" I need to reason step-by-step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, and K2 is the second tallest. But I should confirm the heights to be sure.

Let me recall the heights:

- Mount Everest is in the Himalayas, on the border between Nepal and China. Its height is commonly accepted as 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. I think there was a recent remeasurement, but I'll stick with the standard figure for now.

- K2 is in the Karakoram range, on the border between Pakistan and China. Its height is 8,611 meters (28,251 feet).

I should double-check these numbers to be accurate.

From my knowledge:

- Mount Everest: 8,848 meters

- K2: 8,611 meters

So, 8,848 is greater than 8,611, meaning Everest is taller.

But let's make sure about the sources. I think these are the official heights recognized by most authorities.

I remember that in 2020, Nepal and China jointly announced a new height for Everest as 8,848.86 meters, but it's still around 8,849 meters. K2's height hasn't changed; it's stable at 8,611 meters.

K2 is often called the "Savage Mountain" because it's more difficult to climb, but it's not taller.

Is there any point where K2 might be considered taller? For example, if measured from base to peak, but no, the standard is above sea level.

Mount Everest is measured from sea level, which is the international standard for comparing mountain heights.

Some mountains like Mauna Kea in Hawaii are taller when measured from base, but that's underwater, so for prominence, Everest is still the highest.

But for K2 and Everest, both are measured from sea level.

So, numerically, 8,848 > 8,611, so Everest is taller.

Therefore, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.

The question is: "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?" So the answer should be no.

Now, for step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the heights of both mountains.

   - Mount Everest: 8,848 meters

   - K2: 8,611 meters

2. Compare the numbers: 8,848 is greater than 8,611.

3. Therefore, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

4. Hence, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.

Final answer: No.

I should provide the heights in the reasoning to make it clear.

Also, to be thorough, I can mention the sources or the fact that this is well-established.

But since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll keep it simple.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the standard for measuring mountain height**: The universally accepted method for comparing the heights of mountains is their elevation above sea level. This ensures a consistent baseline for comparison.

2. **Recall the height of Mount Everest**:  
   - Mount Everest, located in the Himalayas, is the tallest mountain in the world. Its official height, as jointly confirmed by Nepal and China in 2020, is **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)**. For simplicity, this is often rounded to **8,849 meters**.

3. **Recall the height of K2**:  
   - K2, located in the Karakoram Range, is the second-tallest mountain in the world. Its official height is **8,611 meters (28,251 feet)**, as recognized by surveys from Pakistan and China.

4. **Compare the heights numerically**:  
   - Mount Everest: ~8,849 meters  
   - K2: 8,611 meters  
   - Since 8,849 > 8,611, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

5. **Consider any potential caveats**:  
   - There are no credible alternative measurements (e.g., from base to peak) that would make K2 taller. For example, while K2 has a more significant base-to-peak rise due to its steep terrain, this does not affect the sea-level elevation comparison.  
   - Recent surveys (like the 2020 Everest remeasurement) have not changed the relative rankings; Everest remains taller.

6. **Conclusion based on the comparison**:  
   - Since Mount Everest's height is greater than K2's height when measured from sea level, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.

**Final Answer: No**
