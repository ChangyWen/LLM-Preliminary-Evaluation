**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether **Medina Lake** is located **north of Rara Lake**, we need to follow a step-by-step reasoning process based on geographical information.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the locations of Medina Lake and Rara Lake**

- **Rara Lake** is a well-known lake located in **Nepal**, in the **Kavre District**, in the **Mid-Himalayas**. It is a popular tourist destination and is situated at an elevation of about **2,500 meters (8,200 feet)** above sea level.

- **Medina Lake** is not a widely recognized or well-documented lake in standard geographical references. It may be a **local or lesser-known body of water**, or it could be a **mispronunciation or misspelling** of another lake (e.g., **Medinipur**, **Medina**, or **Mendip** lakes in other regions).

---

### **Step 2: Determine if both lakes are in the same region or country**

- **Rara Lake** is in **Nepal**.
- **Medina Lake** is not clearly identified in Nepal or any other major region. If it is in **Nepal**, we would need to know its exact location to compare with Rara Lake.

---

### **Step 3: Check for geographical coordinates or maps**

- **Rara Lake** has known coordinates: approximately **27.4333° N, 85.6667° E**.
- **Medina Lake** does not have widely available or verified coordinates. Without this information, we cannot determine its relative position to Rara Lake.

---

### **Step 4: Consider possible confusion or misidentification**

- It is possible that **Medina Lake** is a **misnomer** or a **local name** for a different lake. For example, there is a **Medinipur Lake** in **India**, but it is not near Rara Lake in Nepal.
- There is also a **Medina Lake** in **Texas, USA**, but that is in a completely different part of the world.

---

### **Step 5: Conclusion based on available information**

- Since **Medina Lake** is not clearly identified or located in the same region as **Rara Lake**, and we do not have its exact coordinates, we **cannot definitively say** whether it is located **north of Rara Lake**.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: No**  
*(Because Medina Lake is not clearly identified or located in the same region as Rara Lake, we cannot confirm that it is north of Rara Lake.)*
