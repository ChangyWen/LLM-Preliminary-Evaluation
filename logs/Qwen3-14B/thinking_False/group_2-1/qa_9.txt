Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether **Antarctica is colder than the Arctic**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the geographical locations**

- **Antarctica** is a continent located in the **Southern Hemisphere**, completely surrounded by the Southern Ocean.
- **The Arctic** is a region in the **Northern Hemisphere**, consisting of the Arctic Ocean and surrounding landmasses (e.g., parts of Canada, Russia, Greenland, and Norway).

---

### **Step 2: Consider the type of regions**

- **Antarctica** is a **landmass** covered in ice, with no permanent human population.
- **The Arctic** is mostly **ocean** (Arctic Ocean), with some land areas. It is home to indigenous populations and has more seasonal variation.

---

### **Step 3: Compare average temperatures**

- **Antarctica** has the **lowest average temperatures** on Earth. The average annual temperature is around **-50°C to -60°C** in the interior.
- **The Arctic** has a **milder climate** compared to Antarctica. The average annual temperature is around **-10°C to -20°C**, depending on the season and location.

---

### **Step 4: Consider extreme temperatures**

- The **lowest recorded temperature** on Earth was in **Antarctica** (Vostok Station): **-89.2°C**.
- The **lowest recorded temperature in the Arctic** is much higher, around **-50°C**.

---

### **Step 5: Consider seasonal variation**

- The **Arctic** experiences **longer summers** and **shorter, milder winters**.
- **Antarctica** has **extremely cold winters** and **very short, cold summers**.

---

### **Step 6: Conclusion**

Based on the above comparisons, **Antarctica is significantly colder than the Arctic** in both average and extreme temperatures.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Yes**
