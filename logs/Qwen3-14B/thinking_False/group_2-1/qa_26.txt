Let's go through this step-by-step to determine whether the discovery of penicillin occurred before the discovery of the DNA structure.

---

### Step 1: Identify the key events

- **Discovery of Penicillin**: This refers to the discovery of the antibiotic properties of penicillin.
- **Discovery of DNA Structure**: This refers to the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA.

---

### Step 2: Determine the dates of these discoveries

- **Penicillin**:
  - **Discovered by**: Alexander Fleming
  - **Date**: **1928**
  - **Details**: Fleming noticed that a mold (later identified as *Penicillium notatum*) had killed bacteria in a petri dish. This was the first observation of penicillin's antibacterial properties.

- **DNA Structure**:
  - **Discovered by**: James Watson and Francis Crick, with significant contributions from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins
  - **Date**: **1953**
  - **Details**: Watson and Crick proposed the double-helix model of DNA based on X-ray diffraction data, particularly from Franklin's work.

---

### Step 3: Compare the dates

- Penicillin was discovered in **1928**
- DNA structure was discovered in **1953**

Since **1928 is earlier than 1953**, the discovery of penicillin occurred **before** the discovery of the DNA structure.

---

### Final Answer: **Yes**
