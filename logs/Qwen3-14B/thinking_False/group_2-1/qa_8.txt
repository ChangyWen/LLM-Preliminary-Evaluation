**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert, we need to compare their average temperatures and consider the factors that influence desert climates.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the geographical locations**
- **Sahara Desert**: Located in North Africa, it is the largest hot desert in the world.
- **Gobi Desert**: Located in northern China and southern Mongolia, it is a cold desert, though it can experience very hot summers.

---

### **Step 2: Compare average temperatures**
- **Sahara Desert**:
  - Average daytime temperatures in the Sahara can range from **30°C to 50°C (86°F to 122°F)**, especially in the summer months.
  - Some areas, like the Tibesti Mountains or the Sahara's central regions, can reach **over 50°C (122°F)** during peak summer.

- **Gobi Desert**:
  - Average daytime temperatures in the Gobi can range from **20°C to 40°C (68°F to 104°F)** in the summer.
  - However, the Gobi is a **cold desert**, meaning it has much colder winters, with temperatures sometimes dropping below **-40°C (-40°F)**.

---

### **Step 3: Consider the type of desert**
- The **Sahara** is a **hot desert**, characterized by consistently high temperatures year-round.
- The **Gobi** is a **cold desert**, with extreme temperature variations between summer and winter.

---

### **Step 4: Compare peak temperatures**
- The **Sahara** can reach **much higher temperatures** than the **Gobi** during the summer months.
- The **Gobi** is not known for having the highest temperatures in the world, and its **maximum temperatures are generally lower** than those of the Sahara.

---

### **Step 5: Conclusion**
Based on the comparison of average and peak temperatures, and the classification of the deserts, the **Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert**.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Yes**
