### Step 2: Gather average weights

#### Blue Whale:
- The **blue whale** is the **largest animal on Earth**.
- The **average weight** of a blue whale is around **150 to 180 metric tons** (150,000 to 180,000 kilograms).
- Some adult blue whales can weigh up to **200 metric tons**.

#### Elephant:
- The **African bush elephant** is the **largest land animal**.
- The **average weight** of an adult African bush elephant is around **5,000 to 7,500 kilograms** (5 to 7.5 metric tons).
- The heaviest recorded elephant weighed about **12,000 kilograms** (12 metric tons).

---

### Step 3: Compare the weights

- A **blue whale** weighs **150,000 to 180,000 kilograms**.
- An **elephant** weighs **5,000 to 12,000 kilograms**.

Clearly, the **blue whale is significantly heavier** than even the heaviest elephant.
