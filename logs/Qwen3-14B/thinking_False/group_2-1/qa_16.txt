Let's go through this step by step to determine whether the **boiling point of water is higher than the freezing point of water**.

---

### Step 1: Define the terms

- **Freezing point of water**: This is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a solid (ice).  
- **Boiling point of water**: This is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a gas (vapor).

---

### Step 2: Recall standard values at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm)

- **Freezing point of water** = **0°C** (or **32°F**)  
- **Boiling point of water** = **100°C** (or **212°F**)

---

### Step 3: Compare the two temperatures

- **100°C (boiling point)** is **greater than** **0°C (freezing point)**.

---

### Step 4: Conclusion

Since the boiling point of water (100°C) is **higher** than the freezing point of water (0°C), the answer is:

> **Yes**.
