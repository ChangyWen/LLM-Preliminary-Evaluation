Sure! Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether the United States has a larger population than Canada.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the populations of both countries**

We need to compare the population of the **United States** with that of **Canada**.

- **United States population (as of 2023):** Approximately **334 million**
- **Canada population (as of 2023):** Approximately **40 million**

These figures are based on estimates from official sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau and Statistics Canada.

---

### **Step 2: Compare the two populations**

Now, we compare the two numbers:

- **United States:** ~334 million
- **Canada:** ~40 million

Clearly, **334 million is much greater than 40 million**.

---

### **Step 3: Conclusion**

Since the population of the United States is significantly larger than that of Canada, the answer is:

### ✅ **Yes** — The United States has a larger population than Canada.
