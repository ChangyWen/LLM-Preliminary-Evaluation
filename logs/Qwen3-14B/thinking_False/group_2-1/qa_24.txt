Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether a day on Venus lasts longer than a day on Earth.

---

### Step 1: Define what a "day" means
A **day** on a planet is the time it takes for the planet to complete one full **rotation** on its axis. This is also known as a **solar day** if measured relative to the Sun, or a **sidereal day** if measured relative to distant stars.

For this question, we are most likely referring to the **solar day**, which is the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky (e.g., from noon to noon).

---

### Step 2: Determine the length of a day on Earth
- A **solar day** on Earth is **24 hours**.
- This is the time it takes for the Earth to rotate once on its axis relative to the Sun.

---

### Step 3: Determine the length of a day on Venus
- Venus rotates very slowly and in the **opposite direction** to Earth (it has a **retrograde rotation**).
- A **sidereal day** on Venus (rotation relative to distant stars) is about **243 Earth days**.
- However, because Venus orbits the Sun so slowly (its **year** is about **225 Earth days**), the **solar day** on Venus is actually **longer** than its sidereal day.
- The **solar day** on Venus is approximately **116.75 Earth days**.

---

### Step 4: Compare the two
- A **solar day on Venus**: ~116.75 Earth days
- A **solar day on Earth**: 1 Earth day (24 hours)

---

### Step 5: Final comparison
Since **116.75 Earth days** is **much longer** than **1 Earth day**, a day on Venus **does last longer** than a day on Earth.

---

### âœ… Final Answer: **Yes**
