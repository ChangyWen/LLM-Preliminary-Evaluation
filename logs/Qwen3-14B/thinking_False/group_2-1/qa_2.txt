Sure! Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether Mount Everest is taller than K2.

---

### Step 1: Identify the heights of both mountains

- **Mount Everest** is the highest mountain in the world above sea level.
  - **Height:** 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) — as officially recognized by the Chinese and Nepalese governments in 2020.

- **K2** (also known as **Mount Godwin Austen** or **Chhogori**) is the second-highest mountain in the world.
  - **Height:** Approximately **8,609 meters** (28,241 feet) — this is the most commonly accepted figure, though there can be slight variations due to measurement methods.

---

### Step 2: Compare the two heights

- **Mount Everest:** 8,848.86 meters  
- **K2:** 8,609 meters

Clearly, **Mount Everest is taller** than K2 by about **239.86 meters** (or roughly **787 feet**).

---

### Step 3: Consider any potential exceptions or controversies

- There have been minor disputes over the exact height of both mountains due to different measurement techniques (e.g., GPS, satellite, or traditional surveying).
- However, the most recent and widely accepted measurements still place **Mount Everest above K2**.

---

### Final Answer:

**Yes**, Mount Everest is taller than K2.
