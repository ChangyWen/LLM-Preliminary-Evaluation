Sure! Let's go through this step-by-step to determine whether the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the two speeds**

- **Speed of light**: This is the speed at which light travels through a vacuum.
- **Speed of sound**: This is the speed at which sound waves travel through a medium, such as air, water, or solids.

---

### **Step 2: Recall the approximate values**

- **Speed of light in a vacuum**:  
  $ c = 299,792,458 \, \text{meters per second (m/s)} $  
  For simplicity, we can use:  
  $ c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} $

- **Speed of sound in air (at 20°C)**:  
  $ v = 343 \, \text{m/s} $

---

### **Step 3: Compare the two speeds**

- $ 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} $ (speed of light)  
- $ 343 \, \text{m/s} $ (speed of sound)

Clearly, the speed of light is **much greater** than the speed of sound.

---

### **Step 4: Consider the medium**

- The speed of light is fastest in a **vacuum**.
- The speed of sound depends on the **medium** it's traveling through. It is slower in air than in water or solids, but even in the fastest medium (like water or solids), it is still **much slower** than the speed of light in a vacuum.

---

### **Step 5: Final conclusion**

Yes, the speed of light is **faster than the speed of sound** in all known mediums.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Yes**
