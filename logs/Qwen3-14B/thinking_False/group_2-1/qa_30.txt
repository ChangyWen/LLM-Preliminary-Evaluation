Sure! Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether the average human lifespan is longer than that of a dog.

---

### Step 1: Define the question
We are comparing the **average human lifespan** to the **average dog lifespan** to determine if the human lifespan is **longer**.

---

### Step 2: Determine the average human lifespan
- The **average human lifespan** varies by country, healthcare, and lifestyle, but globally, it is approximately **72 to 75 years**.
- In developed countries with high healthcare standards, the average can be **80 years or more**.

---

### Step 3: Determine the average dog lifespan
- The lifespan of a **dog** depends on the **breed** and **size**.
  - **Small dogs** (e.g., Chihuahuas, Pomeranians): 12–20 years
  - **Medium dogs** (e.g., Beagles, German Shepherds): 10–15 years
  - **Large dogs** (e.g., Great Danes, Mastiffs): 8–12 years
- On average, across all breeds, the **lifespan of a dog is about 10 to 15 years**.

---

### Step 4: Compare the two
- Human lifespan: **72–80+ years**
- Dog lifespan: **10–15 years**
- Clearly, the **average human lifespan is longer** than the average dog lifespan.

---

### Final Answer:
**Yes**.
