**************************************** Content ***************************************
Sure! Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether the atomic number of oxygen is higher than that of carbon.

---

### Step 1: Understand what an atomic number is
The **atomic number** of an element is the number of **protons** in the nucleus of an atom of that element. It defines the identity of the element.

---

### Step 2: Locate the elements on the periodic table
- **Carbon (C)** is the 6th element on the periodic table.
- **Oxygen (O)** is the 8th element on the periodic table.

---

### Step 3: Compare the atomic numbers
- Atomic number of **Carbon (C)** = **6**
- Atomic number of **Oxygen (O)** = **8**

---

### Step 4: Determine if oxygen's atomic number is higher
Since **8 > 6**, the atomic number of oxygen is **higher** than that of carbon.

---

### âœ… Final Answer: **Yes**
