**************************************** Content ***************************************
Sure! Let's go through this step by step to determine whether the distance from Earth to the Sun is greater than the distance from Earth to the Moon.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**
We are being asked to compare two distances:
- Distance from **Earth to the Sun**
- Distance from **Earth to the Moon**

We need to determine if the **Earth–Sun distance** is **greater than** the **Earth–Moon distance**.

---

### **Step 2: Recall approximate distances**

- **Average distance from Earth to the Moon** is about:
  $$
  384,400 \text{ kilometers (km)}
  $$

- **Average distance from Earth to the Sun** is about:
  $$
  149.6 million kilometers (km) = 149,600,000 \text{ km}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Compare the two distances**

Now, compare:
- Earth–Moon: **384,400 km**
- Earth–Sun: **149,600,000 km**

Clearly:
$$
149,600,000 \text{ km} > 384,400 \text{ km}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Conclusion**

The distance from Earth to the Sun is **much greater** than the distance from Earth to the Moon.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Yes**
