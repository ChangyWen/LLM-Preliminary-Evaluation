Let's go through this step by step to determine whether the first moon landing occurred after the first airplane flight.

---

### Step 1: Identify the date of the first airplane flight

The **first powered, controlled, and sustained flight** of an airplane was made by **Orville Wright** on **December 17, 1903**, in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This is widely recognized as the beginning of the aviation era.

---

### Step 2: Identify the date of the first moon landing

The **first moon landing** occurred during the **Apollo 11 mission**, when **Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin** landed on the Moon on **July 20, 1969**.

---

### Step 3: Compare the two dates

- First airplane flight: **December 17, 1903**
- First moon landing: **July 20, 1969**

Since **1969 is later than 1903**, and **July 20 is after December 17** in the same year, the moon landing **definitely occurred after** the first airplane flight.

### Final Answer: **Yes**
