Sure! Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether **gold is more expensive than silver**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**
The question is asking whether **gold is more expensive than silver**, not about their **weight** or **volume**, but about their **price per unit** (typically per ounce or per gram).

---

### **Step 2: Define the units of comparison**
To compare the prices of gold and silver fairly, we should compare them on the **same unit basis**, such as **price per troy ounce**.

- A **troy ounce** is the standard unit used for measuring the price of precious metals.
- 1 troy ounce = 31.1035 grams.

---

### **Step 3: Look up current market prices**
As of the most recent data (as of 2025), the approximate prices are:

- **Gold**: ~$2,500 per troy ounce
- **Silver**: ~$28 per troy ounce

These prices can fluctuate daily based on market conditions, but this gives a general idea.

---

### **Step 4: Compare the prices**
- Gold: ~$2,500 per troy ounce
- Silver: ~$28 per troy ounce

Clearly, **gold is significantly more expensive than silver** on a per-ounce basis.

---

### **Step 5: Consider other factors (optional)**
While the question is about **price**, it's worth noting that:
- Gold is **denser** than silver, so a **gram of gold is more valuable** than a gram of silver.
- However, the question is about **price per unit**, not **density**, so this is not necessary for the answer.

---

### **Final Answer: Yes**  
Gold is more expensive than silver.
