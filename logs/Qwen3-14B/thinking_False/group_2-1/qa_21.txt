Let's go through the question step by step to determine whether **Japan is located east of China**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the geographical orientation of China and Japan**

- **China** is a large country in East Asia, with a long coastline along the **East China Sea**, **South China Sea**, and **Yellow Sea**.
- **Japan** is an island nation located in the **East China Sea** and the **Pacific Ocean**, to the **east of the Korean Peninsula** and **east of China**.

---

### **Step 2: Consider the general direction from China to Japan**

- If you look at a map, **Japan lies to the east of China**, specifically to the **east of the East China Sea**.
- The **closest point** between China and Japan is the **East China Sea**, where the **islands of Japan** (like Honshu) are located **east of the Chinese coast**.

---

### **Step 3: Use a reference point or map for confirmation**

- For example, the **city of Shanghai** in China is located on the **east coast** of China, and **Tokyo**, the capital of Japan, is located **approximately 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) to the east** of Shanghai.
- This confirms that **Japan is to the east of China**.

---

### **Step 4: Consider any possible exceptions or nuances**

- While **Japan is generally east of China**, it is **not entirely east** of China. Some of Japan's islands (like the **Okinawa Islands**) are **south of China**, and the **Kuril Islands** are **north of Japan**, but still **east of Russia**, not China.
- However, **the majority of Japan is located east of China**, and the **main islands** (Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku) are **east of the East China Sea**, which is **east of China**.

---

### **Final Answer: Yes**  
Japan is located **east of China**.
