Sure! Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether a peregrine falcon is faster than an eagle.

---

### Step 1: Identify the types of speeds we are comparing
There are two types of speed to consider when comparing birds of prey:

1. **Level flight speed** – the speed at which a bird flies when moving horizontally.
2. **Dive speed (stoop)** – the speed achieved when a bird dives from a high altitude to catch prey.

---

### Step 2: Determine the speed of a peregrine falcon

- **Level flight speed**: A peregrine falcon can fly at speeds of around **40–60 mph (64–97 km/h)**.
- **Dive speed (stoop)**: The peregrine falcon is known to be the **fastest bird in the world** when diving. It can reach speeds of up to **240 mph (389 km/h)** during a dive.

---

### Step 3: Determine the speed of an eagle

- **Level flight speed**: Most large eagles, such as the bald eagle or golden eagle, fly at speeds of around **20–40 mph (32–64 km/h)** in level flight.
- **Dive speed (stoop)**: Eagles can also dive at high speeds, but not as fast as peregrine falcons. A golden eagle, for example, can reach speeds of up to **120–150 mph (193–241 km/h)** during a dive.

---

### Step 4: Compare the speeds

- In **level flight**, the peregrine falcon is faster than most eagles.
- In **dive speed**, the peregrine falcon is **significantly faster** than any eagle.

---

### Step 5: Final conclusion

Since the peregrine falcon is faster than an eagle in both level flight and especially in a dive, the answer is:

**Yes**.
