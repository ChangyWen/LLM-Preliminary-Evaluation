Sure! Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water.

---

### Step 1: Understand what pH means
- pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution.
- The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14.
  - A pH of 7 is neutral (like pure water).
  - A pH **less than 7** means the solution is **acidic**.
  - A pH **greater than 7** means the solution is **basic** or **alkaline**.

---

### Step 2: Determine the pH of water
- Pure water at 25°C has a pH of **7**, which is neutral.
- However, if the water is not pure (e.g., tap water), it may have a slightly different pH due to dissolved minerals or gases, but it's generally close to 7.

---

### Step 3: Determine the pH of lemon juice
- Lemon juice is known to be **acidic** due to the presence of **citric acid**.
- The pH of lemon juice is typically around **2 to 3**, depending on the concentration and ripeness of the lemon.

---

### Step 4: Compare the two pH values
- Lemon juice: pH ≈ **2 to 3**
- Water: pH ≈ **7**

Since **2 to 3 is less than 7**, lemon juice is **more acidic** than water.

---

### Final Answer:
**Yes**.
