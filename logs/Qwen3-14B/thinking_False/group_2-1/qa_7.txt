Sure! Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether a cheetah is faster than a lion.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**
We are being asked whether a **cheetah is faster than a lion**. This is a comparison of **speed** between two big cats.

---

### **Step 2: Identify the top speeds of both animals**

- **Cheetah**:
  - The **cheetah** is the **fastest land animal**.
  - It can reach **speeds of up to 60–70 mph (97–113 km/h)** in short bursts.
  - These speeds are only sustained for **short distances** (about 20–30 meters), usually during a hunt.

- **Lion**:
  - The **lion** is a powerful predator but not as fast as the cheetah.
  - It can run at **speeds of up to 50 mph (80 km/h)**.
  - Like the cheetah, lions can only maintain this speed for **short distances**.

---

### **Step 3: Compare the speeds**

- Cheetah: **up to 70 mph**
- Lion: **up to 50 mph**

Clearly, the **cheetah is faster** than the lion.

---

### **Step 4: Consider any exceptions or nuances**

- While lions are strong and can chase prey over longer distances, they are **not as fast** as cheetahs.
- Cheetahs rely on **speed** to catch prey, while lions rely more on **strength and teamwork** (especially in prides).
- There are no known cases where a lion can match or exceed a cheetah's top speed.

---

### **Final Answer: Yes**  
A cheetah is faster than a lion.
