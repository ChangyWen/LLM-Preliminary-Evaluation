**************************************** Content ***************************************
Sure! Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether the **Pacific Ocean** is larger than the **Atlantic Ocean**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**
We are being asked whether the **Pacific Ocean** is **larger** than the **Atlantic Ocean** in terms of **surface area**.

---

### **Step 2: Recall basic facts about the oceans**
There are five major oceans on Earth:
1. **Pacific Ocean**
2. **Atlantic Ocean**
3. **Indian Ocean**
4. **Southern Ocean**
5. **Arctic Ocean**

Among these, the **Pacific Ocean** is the **largest**, and the **Atlantic Ocean** is the **second largest**.

---

### **Step 3: Compare surface areas**
Let’s look at approximate surface areas (in square kilometers):

- **Pacific Ocean**: ~165,250,000 km²  
- **Atlantic Ocean**: ~106,460,000 km²

---

### **Step 4: Compare the two**
- The **Pacific Ocean** has a surface area of about **165.25 million km²**.
- The **Atlantic Ocean** has a surface area of about **106.46 million km²**.

Clearly, the **Pacific Ocean** is **larger** than the **Atlantic Ocean**.

---

### **Step 5: Final conclusion**
Based on the comparison of their surface areas, the **Pacific Ocean is larger** than the **Atlantic Ocean**.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Yes**
