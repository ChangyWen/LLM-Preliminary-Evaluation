Sure! Let's go through this step by step to determine whether the wavelength of red light is longer than that of blue light.

---

### Step 1: Understand the electromagnetic spectrum
Visible light is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum. It includes different colors, each with a specific range of wavelengths.

---

### Step 2: Recall the order of visible light by wavelength
In the visible spectrum, light is arranged by wavelength from **longest to shortest** as follows:

**Red → Orange → Yellow → Green → Blue → Indigo → Violet**

This is often remembered using the acronym **ROYGBIV**.

---

### Step 3: Identify the wavelengths of red and blue light
- **Red light** has the **longest wavelength** in the visible spectrum, approximately **620–750 nanometers (nm)**.
- **Blue light** has a **shorter wavelength** than red, approximately **450–495 nanometers (nm)**.

---

### Step 4: Compare the wavelengths
- Red light: ~620–750 nm  
- Blue light: ~450–495 nm  

Since **620–750 nm > 450–495 nm**, the **wavelength of red light is longer** than that of blue light.

---

### Final Answer:
**Yes**.
