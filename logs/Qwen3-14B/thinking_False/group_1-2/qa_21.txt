Let's go through this step by step to determine whether **Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO** is located **east of Sangre de Cristo Range, CO**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Terminology

- **Sangre de Cristo Mountains** and **Sangre de Cristo Range** are often used interchangeably in geographical discussions.
- However, in some contexts, **Sangre de Cristo Mountains** may refer to the **entire mountain range**, while **Sangre de Cristo Range** may refer to a **specific section** of that larger range.

---

### Step 2: Clarify the Geography

- The **Sangre de Cristo Range** is a **segment** of the **Continental Divide** in **south-central Colorado**.
- It runs **north-south** through **southwestern Colorado**, including areas like **Santa Fe, New Mexico**, and **Alamosa, Colorado**.
- The **Sangre de Cristo Mountains** are the **larger, broader term** that includes the **Sangre de Cristo Range** and possibly other adjacent ranges or areas.

---

### Step 3: Determine the Direction

- The **Sangre de Cristo Range** is located in **south-central Colorado**, extending into **New Mexico**.
- The **Sangre de Cristo Mountains** are **not located east of the Sangre de Cristo Range** — in fact, they are **the same geographic feature** or **include the range**.
- Therefore, it is **not accurate** to say that the **Sangre de Cristo Mountains** are **east of the Sangre de Cristo Range**, because they are **not two separate entities** in that spatial relationship.

---

### Step 4: Final Evaluation

- If the **Sangre de Cristo Mountains** and **Sangre de Cristo Range** are the **same or overlapping geographic features**, then the **Sangre de Cristo Mountains cannot be east of the Sangre de Cristo Range**.
- If they are **two distinct features**, the question would need clarification, but based on standard usage, they are **not distinct in that way**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **No**
