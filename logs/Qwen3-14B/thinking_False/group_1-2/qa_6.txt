- **"Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal"**  
  This article seems to be about **U.S. politics**, possibly related to **Congressional recess** and **budget deficit negotiations**. The phrase "Clock Is Ticking" implies urgency, and "Deficit Deal" suggests a **budget or fiscal policy** discussion.

### **Step 2: Determine the Time Periods of the Events**

- **Moscow Mayoral Election Context**  
  Moscow mayoral elections are held every four years. The most recent one was in **2023**, with **Sergei Sobyanin** re-elected. If the article mentions an **activist running for mayor**, it's likely from **2023** or earlier.

- **U.S. Congressional Recess and Deficit Deal**  
  Congressional recesses and budget negotiations are **annual events**. The phrase "Clock Is Ticking for Recess" suggests the article was published **just before a recess**, which typically occurs in **late summer or early fall**. The "Deficit Deal" could be from **2023** or **2022**, depending on the timing of the budget cycle.

---

### **Step 3: Consider the Publication Dates**

Since both articles are from **2023**, we need to determine which one was published **first**.

- **"Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained"**  
  If this article was published **in the spring or early summer of 2023**, it would be earlier than a U.S. article published in **late summer or fall**.

- **"Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal"**  
  If this article was published in **August or September 2023**, it would be **later** than a Moscow article published in **June or July 2023**.

---

### **Step 4: Cross-Reference with Real-World Events (If Possible)**

- The **Moscow mayoral election** in **2023** took place in **September**. If the activist was detained **before** the election, the article could have been published in **June or July 2023**.

- The **U.S. Congressional recess** in **2023** occurred in **August and September**, with budget negotiations ongoing in **July and August**. So, the article about the **deficit deal** could have been published in **July or August 2023**.

---

### **Step 5: Final Comparison**

- If the **Moscow article** was published in **June or July 2023**, and the **U.S. article** was published in **August or September 2023**, then the **Moscow article was published earlier**.
