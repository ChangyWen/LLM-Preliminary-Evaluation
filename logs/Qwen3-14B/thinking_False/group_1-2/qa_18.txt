**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether **Cattaraugus County, NY** is located **west of Cambria County, PA**, we can follow a step-by-step reasoning process based on geography and location.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the locations of both counties**

- **Cattaraugus County, NY** is located in the **western part of New York State**, in the **Southern Tier** region, bordering Pennsylvania and Lake Erie.
- **Cambria County, PA** is located in the **south-central part of Pennsylvania**, near the **Allegheny Mountains** and the **Susquehanna River**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the general direction of each county relative to each other**

- **Cattaraugus County, NY** is in **western New York**, near the **Pennsylvania border**.
- **Cambria County, PA** is in **central Pennsylvania**, **east of the Susquehanna River**.

---

### **Step 3: Use a map or geographic coordinates to compare their positions**

- **Cattaraugus County, NY** is approximately at **42.3° N, 78.7° W**.
- **Cambria County, PA** is approximately at **40.3° N, 78.0° W**.

From these coordinates:

- Cattaraugus County is **north and west** of Cambria County.
- However, the **longitude** (east-west position) of Cattaraugus County is **78.7° W**, and Cambria County is **78.0° W**.

Since **78.7° W is west of 78.0° W**, this means **Cattaraugus County is west of Cambria County**.

### **Step 4: Confirm with a visual reference (map or geography)**

If you look at a map of New York and Pennsylvania:

- Cattaraugus County is on the **western edge of New York**, just across the border from **Erie County, PA**.
- Cambria County is **farther east** in Pennsylvania, in the **central part** of the state.

This confirms that **Cattaraugus County is to the west of Cambria County**.
