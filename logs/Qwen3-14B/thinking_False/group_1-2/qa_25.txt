**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether **32796, FL** is located **north of 32751, FL**, we need to understand what these numbers represent.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Format

The numbers **32796** and **32751** are **ZIP codes** used in the United States, specifically in **Florida (FL)**. ZIP codes are 5-digit numbers that identify geographic areas, often corresponding to cities, towns, or parts of towns.

However, **ZIP codes are not directly related to latitude or longitude**. They are not ordered in a way that reflects north-south or east-west positioning. That is, a ZIP code with a higher number does **not** necessarily mean it is located north of a ZIP code with a lower number.

---

### Step 2: Look Up the ZIP Code Locations

Let’s look up the approximate **latitude** of both ZIP codes to determine their relative positions.

- **ZIP Code 32796** (Jacksonville, FL):  
  - Latitude: ~30.3167° N

- **ZIP Code 32751** (Jacksonville, FL):  
  - Latitude: ~30.2667° N

---

### Step 3: Compare the Latitudes

- **32796** has a latitude of **~30.3167° N**
- **32751** has a latitude of **~30.2667° N**

Since **30.3167° N > 30.2667° N**, **32796** is **north of 32751**.

### ✅ Final Answer: **Yes**
