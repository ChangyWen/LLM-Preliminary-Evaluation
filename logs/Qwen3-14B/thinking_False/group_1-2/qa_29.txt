**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether **Rara Lake** is located **south of Medina Lake**, we need to follow a step-by-step reasoning process based on geographical information.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the locations of Rara Lake and Medina Lake**

- **Rara Lake** is located in **Nepal**, in the **Kavre District**, near the **Sagarmatha National Park**. It is a high-altitude lake, approximately **2,500 meters (8,200 feet)** above sea level.

- **Medina Lake** is not a well-known or widely recognized lake in standard geographical references. However, based on some sources, **Medina Lake** may refer to a lake in **California, USA**, or possibly a smaller, less-known lake in another region.

Since the name "Medina Lake" is not uniquely identified in global geography, we must consider the most likely interpretation.

---

### **Step 2: Consider the most probable location of Medina Lake**

If we assume **Medina Lake** refers to the **Medina Lake in California**, then:

- **Medina Lake** is located in **Alpine County, California**, in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It is approximately **1,800 meters (5,900 feet)** above sea level.

---

### **Step 3: Compare the geographical positions**

- **Rara Lake (Nepal)** is in **Asia**, in the **Himalayan region**.
- **Medina Lake (California, USA)** is in **North America**, in the **Sierra Nevada**.

These two lakes are on **different continents**, and **not in the same general region**. Therefore, it is not possible to determine a north-south relationship between them without a shared reference point or coordinate system.

---

### **Step 4: Use geographical coordinates (if available)**

- **Rara Lake** has approximate coordinates: **27.5333° N, 85.6667° E**
- **Medina Lake (California)** has approximate coordinates: **38.5167° N, 120.2667° W**

Now, we can compare their **latitudes**:

- Rara Lake: **27.5333° N**
- Medina Lake: **38.5167° N**

Since **38.5167° N** is **north of** **27.5333° N**, **Medina Lake is north of Rara Lake**.

---

### **Step 5: Final determination**

If **Medina Lake** is in **California**, then **Rara Lake is south of Medina Lake**.

However, if **Medina Lake** refers to a different location (e.g., a lake in another country or region), the answer could change.

But based on the **most likely interpretation** (Medina Lake in California), the answer is:

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Yes**
