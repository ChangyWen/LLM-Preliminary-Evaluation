Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether an eagle is faster than a peregrine falcon.

---

### Step 1: Identify the types of speed being compared
There are different ways to measure speed in birds of prey:

- **Sustained flight speed**: The speed a bird can maintain over a long distance.
- **Diving speed**: The speed a bird can reach during a dive, often used for hunting.
- **Flapping flight speed**: The speed achieved during normal flight with wing flapping.

The peregrine falcon is particularly known for its **diving speed**, which is the fastest of any bird.

---

### Step 2: Look up the average speeds of both birds

#### Eagle:
- **Sustained flight speed**: Around **40–50 mph (64–80 km/h)**.
- **Diving speed**: Around **100 mph (160 km/h)** or more, depending on the species (e.g., golden eagle).

#### Peregrine Falcon:
- **Sustained flight speed**: Around **40–50 mph (64–80 km/h)**.
- **Diving speed (stoop)**: **200 mph (320 km/h)** or more, making it the fastest animal on Earth in a dive.

---

### Step 3: Compare the speeds

- In **sustained flight**, eagles and peregrine falcons are similar in speed.
- In **diving**, the **peregrine falcon is significantly faster** than the eagle.

---

### Step 4: Determine the context of the question

The question is: **"Is an eagle faster than a peregrine falcon?"**

This is a bit ambiguous, but it's most likely asking about **top speed**, which is typically associated with **diving speed** in birds of prey.

---

### Step 5: Final conclusion

Since the **peregrine falcon is faster than the eagle in a dive**, and that is the most commonly referenced speed when comparing birds of prey, the answer is:

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **No**.
