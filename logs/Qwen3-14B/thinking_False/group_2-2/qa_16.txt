Let's go through this step by step to determine whether the freezing point of water is higher than the boiling point of water.

---

### Step 1: Define the freezing point of water
- The **freezing point** of water is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a solid (ice).
- At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere), the freezing point of water is **0°C** (or **32°F**).

---

### Step 2: Define the boiling point of water
- The **boiling point** of water is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a gas (steam).
- At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere), the boiling point of water is **100°C** (or **212°F**).

---

### Step 3: Compare the two temperatures
- Freezing point of water = **0°C**
- Boiling point of water = **100°C**
- Since **0°C < 100°C**, the freezing point is **lower** than the boiling point.

---

### Step 4: Answer the question
- The question asks: **"Is the freezing point of water higher than the boiling point of water?"**
- Based on the comparison, the freezing point is **not higher** than the boiling point.

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **No**
