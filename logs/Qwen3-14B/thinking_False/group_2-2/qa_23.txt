Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether the pH of water is lower than that of lemon juice.

---

### Step 1: Understand what pH means
- pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a substance is.
- The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14.
  - A pH of 7 is neutral (like pure water).
  - A pH **less than 7** means the substance is **acidic**.
  - A pH **greater than 7** means the substance is **basic** (or alkaline).

---

### Step 2: Determine the pH of water
- **Pure water** has a pH of **7** at 25°C.
- This is considered **neutral** on the pH scale.

---

### Step 3: Determine the pH of lemon juice
- **Lemon juice** is known to be **acidic**.
- The pH of lemon juice typically ranges from **2 to 3**, depending on its concentration and freshness.
- This means it is **much more acidic** than water.

---

### Step 4: Compare the two pH values
- Water: pH = **7**
- Lemon juice: pH = **2 to 3**
- Since **2 to 3 is less than 7**, lemon juice is **more acidic** than water.

---

### Step 5: Answer the question
The question is: **"Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?"**

- **No**, the pH of water is **not lower** than that of lemon juice.
- In fact, the pH of water is **higher** (less acidic) than that of lemon juice.

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **No**
