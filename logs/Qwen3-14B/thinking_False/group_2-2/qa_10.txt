Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether **silver is more expensive than gold**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**
We are being asked whether **silver is more expensive than gold**. This is a comparison of **price per unit weight**, typically measured in **dollars per troy ounce**.

---

### **Step 2: Define the units of measurement**
- Both **gold** and **silver** are typically priced per **troy ounce** (not the standard ounce).
- 1 troy ounce = 31.1035 grams.

---

### **Step 3: Look up current market prices**
As of the most recent data (as of 2025), the approximate prices are:

- **Gold**: ~$2,500 per troy ounce
- **Silver**: ~$28 per troy ounce

> *Note: These are approximate values and can fluctuate daily based on market conditions.*

---

### **Step 4: Compare the prices**
- Gold: ~$2,500 per troy ounce
- Silver: ~$28 per troy ounce

Clearly, **gold is significantly more expensive per troy ounce** than silver.

---

### **Step 5: Consider the question again**
The question is: **"Is silver more expensive than gold?"**

From the comparison above, **silver is not more expensive than gold**.

---

### âœ… **Final Answer: No**
