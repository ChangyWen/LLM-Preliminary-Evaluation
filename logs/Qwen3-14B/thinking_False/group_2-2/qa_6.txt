To determine whether the Yangtze River is longer than the Nile River, we need to compare their lengths based on reliable and commonly accepted measurements.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Length of the Yangtze River**

- The **Yangtze River** is the longest river in **Asia** and the **third-longest river in the world**.
- Its length is generally accepted to be approximately **6,300 kilometers (3,915 miles)**.

---

### **Step 2: Identify the Length of the Nile River**

- The **Nile River** is traditionally considered the **longest river in the world**.
- Its length is often cited as approximately **6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles)**.
- However, there has been some debate over whether the **Nile or the Amazon River** is longer, with recent measurements suggesting the **Amazon may be slightly longer**. But for the purpose of this question, we will use the **traditional accepted length of the Nile**.

---

### **Step 3: Compare the Two Lengths**

- **Nile River**: ~6,650 km  
- **Yangtze River**: ~6,300 km

Since **6,300 km < 6,650 km**, the **Yangtze River is shorter** than the **Nile River**.

### **Final Answer: No**
