Let's go through the question step by step:

**Question:** Is the average lifespan of a dog longer than that of a human?

---

### Step 1: Understand the question
We are being asked to compare the **average lifespan** of two different species: **dogs** and **humans**.

---

### Step 2: Determine the average lifespan of a dog
- The **average lifespan** of a **dog** varies depending on the **breed**, **size**, and **health**.
- However, a **general average** for a **domestic dog** is around **10 to 15 years**.
- Some **smaller breeds** (e.g., Chihuahuas, Dachshunds) can live **15 to 20 years**.
- **Larger breeds** (e.g., Great Danes, Mastiffs) often have **shorter lifespans**, sometimes as low as **8 to 10 years**.

So, the **average lifespan of a dog** is **approximately 10 to 15 years**.

---

### Step 3: Determine the average lifespan of a human
- The **average human lifespan** varies by **country**, **healthcare**, and **lifestyle**.
- Globally, the **average life expectancy** is around **72 to 75 years**.
- In **developed countries**, it can be **80 years or more**.

So, the **average lifespan of a human** is **significantly longer** than that of a dog.

---

### Step 4: Compare the two
- **Dog lifespan:** ~10 to 15 years
- **Human lifespan:** ~72 to 80+ years

Clearly, the **average lifespan of a human is much longer** than that of a dog.

---

### Final Answer: **No**  
The average lifespan of a dog is **not** longer than that of a human.
