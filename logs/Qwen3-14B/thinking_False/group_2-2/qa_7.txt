Sure! Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether a lion is faster than a cheetah.

---

### Step 1: Identify the top speeds of both animals

- **Cheetah**: The cheetah is the fastest land animal. Its top speed is approximately **60 to 70 miles per hour (97 to 113 kilometers per hour)**.
- **Lion**: The lion is a powerful predator but not the fastest. Its top speed is around **35 to 45 miles per hour (56 to 72 kilometers per hour)**.

---

### Step 2: Compare the two speeds

- Cheetah: ~60–70 mph
- Lion: ~35–45 mph

Clearly, the cheetah is faster than the lion.

---

### Step 3: Consider other factors (optional but informative)

- Cheetahs are built for speed and can accelerate quickly, but they can only maintain their top speed for short distances (about 20–30 seconds).
- Lions are more endurance runners and rely on stealth and teamwork to hunt, rather than pure speed.

However, even with these factors, the **top speed** of the cheetah is still greater than that of the lion.

---

### Final Answer: **No**, a lion is not faster than a cheetah.
