Let's go through the question step by step to determine whether a day on Earth lasts longer than a day on Venus.

---

### Step 1: Define what a "day" means in this context

In astronomy, a **day** is defined as the time it takes for a planet to complete one full **rotation** on its axis. This is also called a **sidereal day**.

---

### Step 2: Find the length of a day on Earth

- Earth takes **approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds** to complete one full rotation on its axis (a sidereal day).
- However, because Earth is also orbiting the Sun, the **solar day** (the time from one noon to the next) is slightly longer â€” about **24 hours**.

For this question, we are comparing **rotation periods**, so we'll use the **sidereal day**.

---

### Step 3: Find the length of a day on Venus

- Venus has a **very slow rotation** and also rotates in the **opposite direction** to most planets (retrograde rotation).
- A **sidereal day on Venus** is about **243 Earth days** long.
- This means it takes Venus **243 Earth days** to complete one full rotation on its axis.

---

### Step 4: Compare the two

- **Earth's sidereal day**: ~23.93 hours
- **Venus's sidereal day**: ~243 Earth days

Clearly, a day on Venus is **much longer** than a day on Earth.

---

### Final Answer: **No**  
A day on Earth does **not** last longer than a day on Venus. In fact, a day on Venus is **much longer**.
