**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether the Gobi Desert is hotter than the Sahara Desert, we need to compare their average temperatures and consider the factors that influence desert climates.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Deserts**

- **Gobi Desert**: Located in northern China and southern Mongolia, it is a cold desert, meaning it has low precipitation and cold winters.
- **Sahara Desert**: Located in northern Africa, it is a hot desert, known for extremely high temperatures and very low rainfall.

---

### **Step 2: Compare Average Temperatures**

- **Gobi Desert**:
  - Average annual temperature: **-4°C to 20°C (25°F to 68°F)**
  - Summer temperatures can reach up to **40°C (104°F)** in some areas.
  - Winter temperatures can drop to **-40°C (-40°F)** in the coldest regions.

- **Sahara Desert**:
  - Average annual temperature: **20°C to 30°C (68°F to 86°F)**
  - Daytime temperatures in the summer can exceed **50°C (122°F)** in some parts.
  - Nighttime temperatures can drop significantly, but overall, it is much hotter than the Gobi.

---

### **Step 3: Consider Climate Type**

- The **Gobi** is a **cold desert**, so it experiences extreme temperature variations between day and night, and between seasons.
- The **Sahara** is a **hot desert**, with consistently high temperatures, especially during the day.

---

### **Step 4: Determine Which is Hotter**

- While the Gobi can reach **up to 40°C (104°F)** in summer, the **Sahara** regularly exceeds that, with temperatures often reaching **50°C (122°F)** or more.
- Therefore, the **Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert**.

---

### **Final Answer: No**  
The Gobi Desert is **not** hotter than the Sahara Desert.
