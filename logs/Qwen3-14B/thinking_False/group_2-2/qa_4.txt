Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether Canada has a larger population than the United States.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the populations of both countries**

We need to compare the population of **Canada** with that of the **United States**.

- **Canada's population** (as of 2023): Approximately **40 million** people.
- **United States' population** (as of 2023): Approximately **335 million** people.

These figures are based on estimates from official sources such as the **Statistics Canada** and the **U.S. Census Bureau**.

---

### **Step 2: Compare the two populations**

Now that we have the approximate population numbers:

- Canada: ~40 million
- United States: ~335 million

Clearly, the **United States has a much larger population** than Canada.

---

### **Step 3: Final determination**

Since **335 million > 40 million**, the **United States has a larger population** than Canada.

---

### âœ… **Final Answer: No**  
Canada does **not** have a larger population than the United States.
