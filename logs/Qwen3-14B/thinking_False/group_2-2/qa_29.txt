Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether the wavelength of blue light is longer than that of red light.

---

### Step 1: Understand the electromagnetic spectrum
Visible light is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Within visible light, different colors correspond to different wavelengths.

---

### Step 2: Recall the order of visible light by wavelength
In the visible spectrum, the colors are arranged in the following order **from longest to shortest wavelength**:

**Red > Orange > Yellow > Green > Blue > Indigo > Violet**

This is often remembered using the acronym **ROYGBIV**.

---

### Step 3: Identify the positions of blue and red light
- **Red light** has the **longest wavelength** in the visible spectrum.
- **Blue light** has a **shorter wavelength** than red light.

---

### Step 4: Compare the wavelengths
Since red light has a longer wavelength than blue light, the statement "the wavelength of blue light is longer than that of red light" is **not true**.

---

### Final Answer:
**No**.
