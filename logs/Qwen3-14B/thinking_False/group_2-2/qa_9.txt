Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether the Arctic is colder than Antarctica.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the geographical locations**

- **Arctic** refers to the **Arctic region**, which is a **circle of latitude** around the **North Pole**, mostly covered by the **Arctic Ocean** and surrounded by landmasses like **Greenland**, **Canada**, **Russia**, **Norway**, and **Alaska**.
- **Antarctica** is a **continent** located around the **South Pole**, and it is **completely surrounded by the Southern Ocean**.

---

### **Step 2: Consider the type of landmass**

- The **Arctic** is mostly **ocean** with some land areas.
- **Antarctica** is **landmass** covered by a thick **ice sheet**.

---

### **Step 3: Compare average temperatures**

- **Arctic temperatures**:
  - Average winter temperatures: **-30°C to -40°C** (in the interior).
  - Average summer temperatures: **0°C to 10°C**.
- **Antarctic temperatures**:
  - Average winter temperatures: **-50°C to -60°C** (in the interior).
  - Average summer temperatures: **-20°C to -30°C**.

---

### **Step 4: Consider the effect of ocean vs. land**

- **Oceans** tend to **moderate temperatures** more than land. The Arctic Ocean helps keep the Arctic **less extreme** in temperature.
- **Antarctica**, being a **landmass** with **high elevation** and **extensive ice cover**, retains **cold temperatures** more effectively and experiences **more extreme cold**.

---

### **Step 5: Look at record temperatures**

- The **lowest temperature ever recorded** on Earth was in **Antarctica** at **Vostok Station**: **-89.2°C**.
- The **lowest temperature in the Arctic** is much higher, around **-50°C** or so.

---

### **Conclusion**

Since **Antarctica** experiences **much colder temperatures** than the **Arctic**, the **Arctic is not colder than Antarctica**.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: No**.
