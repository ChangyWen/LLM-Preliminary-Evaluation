Let's go through this step by step to determine whether the discovery of the DNA structure occurred **before** the discovery of penicillin.

---

### Step 1: Identify the key events

- **Discovery of penicillin**: This refers to the discovery of the antibiotic **penicillin**, which was first identified by **Alexander Fleming** in 1928.
- **Discovery of DNA structure**: This refers to the **double-helix structure of DNA**, which was discovered by **James Watson and Francis Crick** in 1953, with significant contributions from **Rosalind Franklin** and **Maurice Wilkins**.

---

### Step 2: Compare the dates

- **Penicillin** was discovered in **1928**.
- **DNA structure** was discovered in **1953**.

---

### Step 3: Determine the chronological order

Since **1928 (penicillin)** is **earlier** than **1953 (DNA structure)**, the discovery of penicillin occurred **before** the discovery of the DNA structure.

---

### Final Answer: **No**  
The discovery of DNA structure **was not** before the discovery of penicillin.
