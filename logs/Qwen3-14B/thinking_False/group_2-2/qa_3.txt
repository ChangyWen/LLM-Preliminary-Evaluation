Let's go through the question step by step to determine whether **Isaac Newton died later than Albert Einstein**.

---

### Step 1: Identify the dates of death for both scientists.

- **Isaac Newton**:
  - Born: January 4, 1643 (in the Julian calendar, which was used in England at the time; this corresponds to December 25, 1642 in the Gregorian calendar).
  - Died: March 31, 1727 (Gregorian calendar).

- **Albert Einstein**:
  - Born: March 14, 1879.
  - Died: April 18, 1955.

---

### Step 2: Compare the dates of death.

- Newton died in **1727**.
- Einstein died in **1955**.

Since **1955 is later than 1727**, Einstein died **after** Newton.

---

### Step 3: Final determination.

The question asks: **Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?**

- **No**, because **Albert Einstein died later** than Isaac Newton.

---

### âœ… Final Answer: **No**.
