Let's go through the question step by step to determine whether the **speed of sound is faster than the speed of light**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the two speeds

- **Speed of sound**: This is the speed at which sound waves travel through a medium (like air, water, or solids). It depends on the medium's properties.
- **Speed of light**: This is the speed at which light travels in a vacuum, and it is a fundamental constant in physics.

---

### Step 2: Know the approximate values

- **Speed of sound in air** (at 20°C):  
  ≈ **343 meters per second (m/s)**

- **Speed of light in a vacuum**:  
  ≈ **299,792,458 meters per second (m/s)**  
  Often rounded to **3.00 × 10⁸ m/s** for simplicity.

---

### Step 3: Compare the two speeds

- **Speed of light**: ~300,000,000 m/s  
- **Speed of sound**: ~343 m/s

Clearly, the **speed of light is much greater** than the **speed of sound**.

---

### Step 4: Consider any possible exceptions

- In **some media**, the **speed of sound can be higher** (e.g., in water or solids), but even in the fastest known medium (like diamond), the speed of sound is still **far less** than the speed of light.
- The **speed of light in a vacuum** is the **maximum speed** in the universe, according to Einstein's theory of relativity.

---

### Final Answer:

**No**, the speed of sound is **not faster** than the speed of light.
