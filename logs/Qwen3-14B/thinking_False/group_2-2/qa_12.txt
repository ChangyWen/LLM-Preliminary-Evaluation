Let's go through this step by step to determine whether the British Empire existed before the Roman Empire.

---

### Step 1: Define the Roman Empire
The **Roman Empire** was a vast civilization that originated in the city of Rome in **Italy**. It was established in **27 BCE** when **Augustus** became the first Roman emperor, marking the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire lasted for several centuries, reaching its peak in the 2nd century CE.

---

### Step 2: Define the British Empire
The **British Empire** was a global empire that originated from the **United Kingdom** (formerly England, and later including Scotland, Wales, and Ireland). It began to expand in the **16th century**, with early colonization efforts in the **Americas** and **India**. The British Empire reached its height in the **19th and early 20th centuries**, becoming the largest empire in history in terms of area.

---

### Step 3: Compare the timelines
- The **Roman Empire** began in **27 BCE**.
- The **British Empire** began to take shape in the **16th century CE**.

This means the **Roman Empire existed long before the British Empire**.

---

### Step 4: Consider any possible earlier British empires
Before the British Empire, there were **ancient British tribes** and **kingdoms**, such as the **Celtic tribes** and the **Kingdom of Wessex**, but these were **not empires** in the same sense as the Roman or British Empires. They were **smaller political entities** and not global empires.

---

### Step 5: Final conclusion
Since the **Roman Empire** began in **27 BCE** and the **British Empire** did not exist until the **16th century CE**, the **British Empire did not exist before the Roman Empire**.

---

### âœ… Final Answer: **No**.
