**************************************** Content ***************************************
Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is less than that on the Moon.

---

### Step 1: Understand the concept of acceleration due to gravity

The **acceleration due to gravity** is the acceleration that an object experiences when it is in free fall near the surface of a celestial body. It is denoted by the symbol **g**.

---

### Step 2: Recall the known values of acceleration due to gravity

- On **Earth**, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately:
  $$
  g_{\text{Earth}} \approx 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2
  $$

- On the **Moon**, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately:
  $$
  g_{\text{Moon}} \approx 1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2
  $$

---

### Step 3: Compare the two values

Now, compare the two values:

$$
g_{\text{Earth}} = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \quad \text{and} \quad g_{\text{Moon}} = 1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2
$$

Clearly:
$$
g_{\text{Earth}} > g_{\text{Moon}}
$$

### Step 4: Answer the question

The question asks: **"Is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth less than that on the Moon?"**

From the comparison above, we see that the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is **greater than** that on the Moon.

### âœ… Final Answer: **No**
