Let's go through this step by step to determine whether an elephant has a larger heart than a blue whale.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the animals involved**
- **Elephant**: The African bush elephant is the largest land animal. It can weigh up to around **6,000 kg (13,000 lbs)**.
- **Blue whale**: The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth, with adults weighing up to **180,000 kg (400,000 lbs)** or more.

---

### **Step 2: Consider the size of their hearts**
- The **heart size** of an animal is generally proportional to its body size, though not always in a 1:1 ratio. Larger animals tend to have larger hearts to pump blood through their larger bodies.

---

### **Step 3: Look at approximate heart sizes**
- **Elephant's heart**: The heart of an adult African elephant is about **25–30 kg (55–66 lbs)**.
- **Blue whale's heart**: The heart of a blue whale can weigh up to **180 kg (400 lbs)** or more, making it the **largest heart of any animal**.

---

### **Step 4: Compare the two**
- **Elephant's heart**: ~25–30 kg  
- **Blue whale's heart**: ~180 kg or more

Clearly, the **blue whale's heart is much larger** than that of an elephant.

---

### **Final Answer: No**  
An elephant does **not** have a larger heart than a blue whale.
