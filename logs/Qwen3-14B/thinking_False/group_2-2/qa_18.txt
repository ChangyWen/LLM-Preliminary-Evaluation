**************************************** Content ***************************************
Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether the distance from Earth to the Moon is greater than the distance from Earth to the Sun.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**
We are being asked to compare two distances:
- Distance from **Earth to the Moon**
- Distance from **Earth to the Sun**

We need to determine if the **Earth-Moon distance** is **greater than** the **Earth-Sun distance**.

---

### **Step 2: Recall approximate distances**

- **Earth to the Moon**:
  - Average distance: **about 384,400 kilometers (km)**

- **Earth to the Sun**:
  - Average distance: **about 149.6 million kilometers (km)**

---

### **Step 3: Compare the two distances**

Now, compare:
- Earth-Moon: ~384,400 km
- Earth-Sun: ~149,600,000 km

Clearly, **149,600,000 km is much greater than 384,400 km**.

---

### **Step 4: Final conclusion**

Since the **distance from Earth to the Sun is much greater** than the **distance from Earth to the Moon**, the answer to the question is:

> **No**, the distance from Earth to the Moon is **not** greater than the distance from Earth to the Sun.

### âœ… **Final Answer: No**
