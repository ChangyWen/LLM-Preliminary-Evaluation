Okay, so I need to figure out if the wavelength of blue light is longer than that of red light. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about light and the electromagnetic spectrum. 

First, I remember that visible light is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. The order of colors in the visible spectrum is usually remembered with the acronym ROYGBIV: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. But wait, I think sometimes people simplify it to just Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet. Anyway, the key point is that the colors are arranged in a specific order based on their wavelengths.

Now, I need to remember which color has a longer wavelength. I think red light has the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum, and violet or purple has the shortest. So if red is longer than blue, then blue would have a shorter wavelength than red. But wait, the question is asking if blue's wavelength is longer than red's. So if red is longer, then blue is shorter. Therefore, the answer would be no. But I need to be sure.

Let me think about the electromagnetic spectrum again. The visible spectrum ranges from about 380 nanometers (nm) for violet to 700 nm for red. Wait, so red is around 700 nm, blue is somewhere in the middle. Let me recall specific numbers. Blue light is typically around 450-495 nm, while red is around 620-750 nm. So yes, red has a longer wavelength than blue. Therefore, blue light's wavelength is shorter than red's. 

But wait, I should check if I have the numbers right. Maybe I mixed up the order. Let me think: lower frequency corresponds to longer wavelength. Red light has a lower frequency than blue light. Since frequency and wavelength are inversely related (c = λν, where c is speed of light, λ is wavelength, ν is frequency), if red has lower frequency, it must have a longer wavelength. So blue has higher frequency, shorter wavelength. Therefore, blue's wavelength is shorter than red's. 

So the answer is no, blue light does not have a longer wavelength than red light. Red has a longer wavelength. Therefore, the answer is No.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding the Electromagnetic Spectrum:**  
   Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, with different colors corresponding to different wavelengths. The order of colors from longest to shortest wavelength is: **Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet** (ROYGBIV).

2. **Wavelength Ranges:**  
   - **Red light** has wavelengths approximately **620–750 nm**.  
   - **Blue light** has wavelengths approximately **450–495 nm**.  

3. **Frequency-Wavelength Relationship:**  
   The speed of light ($c$) is constant, and wavelength ($\lambda$) and frequency ($\nu$) are inversely related via $c = \lambda \nu$.  
   - **Red light** has a **lower frequency** than blue light.  
   - Since frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional, **lower frequency corresponds to longer wavelength**.  

4. **Conclusion:**  
   Red light has a **longer wavelength** than blue light. Therefore, the wavelength of blue light is **not longer** than that of red light.

**Final Answer:** No.
