Okay, let's see. The question is whether Isaac Newton died later than Albert Einstein. Hmm, I need to figure out the dates of their deaths and compare them.

First, I remember that Isaac Newton was a scientist from the 17th century. He was born in 1643 and died in 1727, I think. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should double-check that. Wait, I think he died in 1727, but I'm not certain about the exact date. Let me think... Newton was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution, so his death would be in the early 18th century.

Now, Albert Einstein was a more modern physicist, known for the theory of relativity. He was born in 1879 and died in 1955, if I recall correctly. That's right, he died in the mid-20th century. So Einstein died in 1955, and Newton died in 1727. Comparing those years, 1955 is way later than 1727. So Einstein died after Newton. Therefore, the answer would be No, because Newton died earlier than Einstein. Wait, the question is asking if Newton died later than Einstein. So if Newton died in 1727 and Einstein in 1955, then Newton died earlier. So the answer is No, he didn't die later. 

But wait, maybe I mixed up the dates? Let me confirm. Newton's death date: I think he died on March 31, 1727. Einstein died on April 18, 1955. Yes, that's correct. So 1727 is definitely before 1955. Therefore, Newton died earlier, so the answer is No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Death Dates:**
   - **Isaac Newton** died on **March 31, 1727**.
   - **Albert Einstein** died on **April 18, 1955**.

2. **Compare the Dates:**
   - 1727 (Newton) is **earlier** than 1955 (Einstein).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since Newton died in 1727 and Einstein died in 1955, Newton did **not** die later than Einstein.

**Final Answer:** No.
