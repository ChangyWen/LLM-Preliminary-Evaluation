Okay, so I need to figure out if an elephant is heavier than a blue whale. Let me start by recalling what I know about these animals. 

First, I remember that blue whales are the largest animals on Earth. I think they're way bigger than elephants. But wait, I should check the exact numbers to be sure. 

I know that the African bush elephant is the largest land animal. I think their weight can be around 6 tons or more. But I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should look up the average weight of an elephant. Let me think... I've heard that adult male African elephants can weigh up to 6,000 kilograms, which is 6 tons. But I also remember that blue whales are much larger. 

Now, blue whales. I think they can be as long as 30 meters, which is like 98 feet. But how much do they weigh? I recall that their weight is in the hundreds of tons. Wait, I think the average blue whale weighs around 150 to 180 tons. That's way more than an elephant. 

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me try to be precise. Let's convert the weights to the same unit. If an elephant is 6 tons, and a blue whale is 150 tons, then obviously the blue whale is heavier. But I need to confirm these numbers. 

Another thought: I've heard that a blue whale's heart is as big as a car, and their tongues are as heavy as an elephant. So if their tongue is as heavy as an elephant, that would mean the blue whale is at least as heavy as an elephant. But maybe even more. 

Wait, but the question is about the entire weight of the animal. So if the blue whale's tongue is as heavy as an elephant, then the whole blue whale would be much heavier. 

Let me check the exact figures. According to what I remember, the average weight of an African bush elephant is about 5,000 to 6,000 kilograms, which is 5 to 6 metric tons. On the other hand, a blue whale can weigh up to 180 metric tons. So 180 tons versus 6 tons. That's a huge difference. 

But maybe I should check if there are any exceptions. Are there any elephants that are heavier than blue whales? No, I don't think so. Even the largest elephants are nowhere near the weight of a blue whale. 

So putting it all together: the blue whale is significantly heavier than an elephant. Therefore, the answer should be No, an elephant is not heavier than a blue whale.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Animals:**  
   - **Elephant:** The African bush elephant is the largest land animal.  
   - **Blue Whale:** The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth.  

2. **Compare Average Weights:**  
   - **Elephant:** Adult males weigh approximately **5,000–6,000 kg (5–6 metric tons)**.  
   - **Blue Whale:** Adult blue whales weigh **150–180 metric tons** (150,000–180,000 kg).  

3. **Quantitative Comparison:**  
   - A blue whale’s weight is **25–30 times greater** than that of an elephant.  

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - The blue whale is vastly heavier than any elephant.  

**Final Answer:** No.
