Okay, so I need to figure out if K2 is taller than Mount Everest. Let me start by recalling what I know about these mountains. Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, right? I think it's in the Himalayas, between Nepal and China. But wait, I've heard that K2 is also a very high mountain. I think K2 is part of the Karakoram range, which is in the Himalayas as well, but maybe in a different country.

First, I should check the elevations of both mountains. I remember that Mount Everest's elevation is around 8,848 meters or 29,029 feet. But I'm not sure about the exact number. For K2, I think it's slightly shorter than Everest. Maybe around 8,600 meters? Wait, but I need to be precise here. Let me try to recall or think of sources. I know that K2 is often called the "Savage Mountain" because it's more dangerous to climb than Everest. But does that relate to its height?

Wait, I think the exact height of Everest was recently measured again. In 2020, there was an announcement that Everest's height was 8,848.86 meters. But I need to confirm K2's height. I believe K2 is about 8,600 meters, but I'm not certain. Let me think. If I remember correctly, K2 is the second highest mountain in the world, so it should be just below Everest. So if Everest is 8,848 meters, K2 would be, say, 8,600 meters. That would make Everest taller. But I need to be sure about the exact numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of other mountains. For example, Kanchenjunga is the third highest, around 8,586 meters. So if K2 is second, it should be higher than Kanchenjunga. So if K2 is higher than Kanchenjunga, then it's lower than Everest. That would mean the answer is no, K2 is not taller than Everest. But I need to make sure that K2's elevation is indeed less than Everest's.

Another way: I can think of the order of the highest mountains. The top five are Everest, K2, Kanchenjunga, Lhotse, and Makalu. So K2 is second, which would mean it's shorter than Everest. Therefore, the answer should be no. But I need to confirm the exact heights. Let me try to recall. Everest is 8,848 meters, K2 is 8,605 meters. Wait, that's a difference of about 243 meters. So yes, Everest is taller. Therefore, the answer is no, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Mountains:**  
   - **Mount Everest** is the highest mountain in the world, located in the Himalayas on the border of Nepal and China.  
   - **K2** (also known as "Mount Godwin Austen") is the second-highest mountain, part of the Karakoram range on the border of Pakistan and China.  

2. **Compare Elevations:**  
   - **Mount Everest's elevation** is officially **8,848.86 meters (29,029.3 feet)** as measured in 2020.  
   - **K2's elevation** is **8,605 meters (28,229 feet)**, according to the most recent surveys.  

3. **Conclusion Based on Data:**  
   - Since **8,848.86 meters (Everest) > 8,605 meters (K2)**, Mount Everest is significantly taller than K2.  

**Final Answer:** No.
