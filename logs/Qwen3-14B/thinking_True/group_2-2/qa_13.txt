Okay, so I need to figure out if the Berlin Wall is longer than the Great Wall of China. Let me start by recalling what I know about both walls.

First, the Great Wall of China. I remember that it's one of the most famous landmarks in the world. It was built over many centuries, starting as early as the 7th century BC, with major construction during the Ming Dynasty. The wall is known for its length, but I'm not exactly sure how long it is. I think it's something like 13,000 to 14,000 miles, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should check that.

Then there's the Berlin Wall. That was built during the Cold War, right? It separated East and West Berlin from 1961 until 1989 when it fell. I think the wall itself wasn't that long compared to the Great Wall. But I need to get the exact numbers. I recall that the Berlin Wall was about 96 miles long, but I'm not sure if that's the total length including all the barriers or just the main wall. Also, there were other parts like the death strip and guard towers, but maybe those aren't counted in the main length.

Wait, I should verify the exact lengths. Let me think. The Great Wall of China's total length is often cited as around 13,000 miles (21,000 kilometers), but some sources might say 14,000 miles. However, I've also heard that the official length is about 13,170 miles (21,196 kilometers) according to the Chinese government. But I need to confirm that.

For the Berlin Wall, I think the main wall was approximately 96 miles (155 kilometers) long. However, when considering all the barriers, roads, and other structures that were part of the border, the total length might be longer. But I think the commonly cited figure is around 96 miles for the main wall. 

So comparing the two: 13,000 miles vs. 96 miles. That would mean the Great Wall is way longer. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me check again. The Great Wall is about 13,000 miles, and the Berlin Wall is about 96 miles. So 13,000 is much longer than 96. Therefore, the answer would be No, the Berlin Wall is not longer than the Great Wall of China. 

But I should make sure I'm not confusing the units. If the Great Wall is 21,000 kilometers, and the Berlin Wall is 155 kilometers, then yes, 21,000 is way more than 155. So the conclusion is that the Great Wall is significantly longer. Therefore, the answer is No.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Lengths:**
   - **Great Wall of China:** The total length is approximately **13,170 miles (21,196 kilometers)**, according to official Chinese measurements. This includes all historical sections and extensions.
   - **Berlin Wall:** The main structure of the Berlin Wall was about **96 miles (155 kilometers)** long, though some sources include additional barriers and roads, bringing the total to around **155 kilometers (96 miles)**.

2. **Compare the Two:**
   - The Great Wall of China is **over 13,000 miles** long, while the Berlin Wall is **less than 100 miles** long.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The Great Wall of China is significantly longer than the Berlin Wall.

**Final Answer:** No.
