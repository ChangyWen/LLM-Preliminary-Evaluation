Okay, so I need to figure out if silver is more expensive than gold. Let me start by recalling what I know about these metals. Both are precious metals, but I think gold is usually more valuable. But I'm not entirely sure, so I should check some factors.

First, maybe I should look at their market prices. I remember that gold prices are often quoted in dollars per troy ounce. Silver is also priced per troy ounce, but I think the price per ounce for silver is lower than gold. For example, if gold is around $2000 per ounce, silver might be like $25 or something. But wait, that's a big difference. However, maybe the price per unit weight isn't the only factor. Sometimes people talk about price per gram or per kilogram. Let me think. If gold is $2000 per ounce, and silver is $25 per ounce, then per gram, gold would be much more expensive. Because one troy ounce is about 31.1 grams. So gold at $2000 per 31.1 grams would be roughly $64.3 per gram. Silver at $25 per 31.1 grams would be about $0.80 per gram. So per gram, gold is way more expensive. But the question is about being "more expensive," which could be ambiguous. If it's per ounce, then gold is more expensive. If it's per unit weight, same thing. But maybe the user is thinking about the price per unit volume? Wait, but metals are usually priced by weight, not volume. So I think the answer is no, silver isn't more expensive than gold. But I should check if there are any other factors. Maybe in certain forms, like jewelry or coins, the price could be different due to craftsmanship or rarity. But generally, as raw materials, gold is more expensive. Also, looking at historical data, gold has consistently been more valuable than silver. For example, the gold-to-silver ratio is often around 80:1 or higher, meaning one ounce of gold is worth 80 ounces of silver. That would mean gold is more expensive. So based on current market prices and historical trends, silver is not more expensive than gold. Therefore, the answer should be No.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Market Pricing Basis:** Both gold and silver are priced per troy ounce (1 troy ounce ≈ 31.1 grams).  
   - **Gold:** Typically trades at around **$2,000–$2,500 per troy ounce** (as of recent years).  
   - **Silver:** Usually trades at **$25–$30 per troy ounce** (same timeframe).  

2. **Price Per Unit Weight:**  
   - **Gold:** $2,000 ÷ 31.1g ≈ **$64.3 per gram**.  
   - **Silver:** $25 ÷ 31.1g ≈ **$0.80 per gram**.  
   - **Conclusion:** Gold is significantly more expensive per gram.  

3. **Historical Context:** The **gold-to-silver ratio** (ounces of silver per ounce of gold) is often **80:1 or higher**, reflecting gold's higher value.  

4. **Other Factors:**  
   - **Jewelry/Coins:** Craftsmanship or rarity might increase silver's value in specific forms, but this is not typical for raw materials.  
   - **Industrial Use:** Silver has industrial applications, but this does not make it more expensive than gold.  

**Final Answer:** No.
