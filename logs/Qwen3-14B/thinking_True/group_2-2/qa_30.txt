Okay, let's see. The question is whether the average lifespan of a dog is longer than that of a human. Hmm, I need to think about this step by step.

First, I know that different dog breeds have different lifespans. For example, smaller dogs like Chihuahuas or Pomeranians tend to live longer than larger breeds like Great Danes or Mastiffs. But I think the average for dogs in general is around 10 to 15 years. Wait, I should check that. Maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. I remember reading that the average lifespan of a dog is about 10-13 years, but it can vary a lot depending on the breed and size.

Now, for humans, the average lifespan is much longer. In many countries, the average life expectancy is around 70 to 80 years. For example, in the United States, the average life expectancy is about 78 years. So, even if a dog lives up to 15 years, that's still way shorter than a human's average lifespan.

Wait, but maybe the question is about a specific type of dog? No, the question just says "a dog" in general. So I should consider the average across all dog breeds. Let me confirm the numbers again. If the average dog lives around 10-15 years and humans live 70-80, then the answer is definitely no. The human lifespan is longer. 

I don't think there's any overlap where a dog's average lifespan would be longer. Even the longest-lived dogs, like some small breeds, might reach 18-20 years, but that's still less than the human average. So the answer should be No.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Determine the average lifespan of a dog:**
   - Dogs vary by breed, but the general average lifespan is **10–15 years** for most breeds. Smaller breeds (e.g., Chihuahuas) may live up to **18–20 years**, while larger breeds (e.g., Great Danes) often live **8–10 years**. The overall average is typically cited as **12–15 years**.

2. **Determine the average lifespan of a human:**
   - The global average human lifespan is **70–80 years**, depending on region, healthcare, and lifestyle. In developed countries, it is closer to **78–85 years**.

3. **Compare the two averages:**
   - Even the upper end of a dog's lifespan (e.g., 20 years) is **significantly shorter** than the lower end of a human's average lifespan (e.g., 70 years).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The average lifespan of a dog is **not longer** than that of a human.

**Final Answer:** No.
