Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the first airplane flight happened after the first moon landing. Hmm, I need to figure out the dates of both events.

First, the first airplane flight. I remember that the Wright brothers made the first powered flight. When was that? I think it was in 1903. Let me confirm. Yes, December 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. That's when Orville Wright flew the Wright Flyer for about 12 seconds.

Now, the first moon landing. That was the Apollo 11 mission, right? I believe that was in 1969. Specifically, July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon. Armstrong was the first to step on the lunar surface.

So comparing the dates: the first airplane flight was in 1903, and the first moon landing was in 1969. Since 1903 is way before 1969, the airplane flight was definitely before the moon landing. Therefore, the answer should be No, the first airplane flight was not after the first moon landing. It was over 60 years earlier.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the first airplane flight:**  
   The first successful powered airplane flight was made by the Wright brothers on **December 17, 1903**, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This is widely recognized as the first controlled, sustained, and powered flight.

2. **Identify the first moon landing:**  
   The first moon landing occurred on **July 20, 1969**, during NASA's Apollo 11 mission. Astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the Moon.

3. **Compare the dates:**  
   - First airplane flight: **1903**  
   - First moon landing: **1969**  
   The airplane flight occurred **66 years earlier** than the moon landing.

4. **Conclusion:**  
   Since the first airplane flight (1903) predates the first moon landing (1969), the answer is **No**.

**Final Answer:** No.
