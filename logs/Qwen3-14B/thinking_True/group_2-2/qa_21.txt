Okay, let's see. The question is whether China is located east of Japan. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should recall the general locations of China and Japan on the map. I know that both countries are in East Asia. China is a large country, and Japan is an island nation. I think Japan is to the east of China, but I need to be precise here.

Let me visualize the map. China is on the mainland, with its eastern border near the Korean Peninsula. Japan is an archipelago to the east of the Korean Peninsula. So, if I imagine looking at a map, China is to the west of Japan. Wait, but the question is asking if China is east of Japan. That would mean the opposite. So if Japan is east of China, then China is west of Japan. Therefore, the answer would be no, China is not east of Japan; it's west.

But maybe I should check the coordinates. Let me think about the coordinates of both countries. China's capital, Beijing, is around 39.9042° N, 116.4074° E. Japan's capital, Tokyo, is approximately 35.6895° N, 139.7592° E. Comparing the longitudes, Tokyo is at 139.76° E, and Beijing is at 116.41° E. Since Tokyo has a higher longitude, it's further east. Therefore, China is west of Japan. So the answer is no, China is not east of Japan.

Wait, but longitude measures east-west. So higher longitude means more east. So if Japan's longitude is higher than China's, then Japan is east of China. Therefore, China is west of Japan. So the answer is no, China is not east of Japan. That makes sense. I think that's correct.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Geographical Context:**  
   - China is a mainland country in East Asia, bordered by the Korean Peninsula to the east.  
   - Japan is an island nation located to the east of the Korean Peninsula.  

2. **Relative Positioning:**  
   - On a map, Japan lies to the **east** of China, while China is to the **west** of Japan.  

3. **Coordinate Analysis:**  
   - **Beijing (China):** Latitude ≈ 39.90° N, Longitude ≈ 116.41° E.  
   - **Tokyo (Japan):** Latitude ≈ 35.69° N, Longitude ≈ 139.76° E.  
   - Longitude values indicate east-west position. Since Tokyo (139.76° E) has a higher longitude than Beijing (116.41° E), **Japan is further east** than China.  

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - China is **west** of Japan, not east.  

**Final Answer:** No.
