Okay, so I need to figure out if a day on Earth is longer than a day on Venus. Let me start by recalling what a day means. A day is the time it takes for a planet to rotate once on its axis, right? So, the length of a day depends on the planet's rotation period.

First, I should check the rotation periods of both Earth and Venus. I know that Earth's day is 24 hours. But what about Venus? I remember that Venus has a very slow rotation. Wait, isn't it something like 243 Earth days? But wait, that seems really long. Let me confirm that. 

I think Venus rotates in the opposite direction to Earth, which is called retrograde rotation. But does that affect the length of the day? Probably not the duration, just the direction. So, if Venus takes 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, then a day on Venus is 243 Earth days long. That would mean that a day on Venus is much longer than a day on Earth. But wait, I also heard something about the solar day on Venus being longer. Wait, what's the difference between a sidereal day and a solar day?

A sidereal day is the time it takes for a planet to rotate once relative to the distant stars, while a solar day is the time between two noons, when the Sun is at its highest point. For Earth, the solar day is 24 hours, which is slightly longer than the sidereal day because Earth has moved in its orbit around the Sun. But for Venus, since it rotates so slowly and in the opposite direction, the solar day might be different. 

Let me check the numbers. The sidereal rotation period of Venus is about 243 Earth days. But because Venus orbits the Sun in about 225 Earth days, the solar day would be longer. Wait, how does that work? If a planet rotates in the same direction as it orbits, the solar day is longer than the sidereal day. But Venus rotates in the opposite direction. So, maybe the solar day is shorter? Or longer?

Let me think. The formula for the solar day is 1/(1/rotation period - 1/orbital period) if the rotation and orbital directions are the same. But if they are opposite, it would be 1/(1/rotation period + 1/orbital period). Let me plug in the numbers. Venus's sidereal rotation period is 243 days, and its orbital period is 225 days. Since they are in opposite directions, the solar day would be 1/(1/243 + 1/225). Let me calculate that. 

First, convert to common denominators. 1/243 is approximately 0.004115, and 1/225 is approximately 0.004444. Adding them gives about 0.008559. Then, 1 divided by that is approximately 116.75 Earth days. Wait, so the solar day on Venus is about 117 Earth days? That's shorter than the sidereal day. But that seems counterintuitive. If Venus is rotating backwards, maybe the solar day is shorter. 

But the question is about the length of a day. Which one are we considering? The question doesn't specify, but usually, when people talk about a day, they might refer to the solar day. However, sometimes in astronomy, the sidereal day is used. But I need to check what's standard. 

For Earth, the solar day is 24 hours, which is what we use in daily life. For Venus, if the solar day is about 117 Earth days, then that's shorter than Earth's solar day. But if the question is about the sidereal day, then Venus's day is 243 Earth days, which is longer than Earth's 24 hours. 

But the question is phrased as "a day on Earth" versus "a day on Venus." So, which definition of a day is being used here? If it's the solar day, then Venus's solar day is shorter than Earth's. If it's the sidereal day, then Venus's is longer. 

But I need to check standard definitions. In planetary science, the term "day" can be ambiguous. However, when comparing the length of a day between planets, it's often the sidereal day that's used. For example, Earth's sidereal day is about 23 hours, 56 minutes, which is shorter than the solar day. But when we say a day on Earth is 24 hours, that's the solar day. 

So, if the question is using the solar day, then Venus's solar day is about 117 Earth days, which is longer than Earth's 24 hours. Wait, no, 117 Earth days is way longer than 24 hours. Wait, 117 days is 117*24 hours, which is 2808 hours. That's way longer than Earth's 24 hours. So, if the solar day on Venus is 117 Earth days, then yes, a day on Venus is longer than a day on Earth. 

But earlier I thought the solar day was shorter. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the formula. 

The formula for the solar day when the rotation and orbital directions are opposite is 1/(1/P + 1/Y), where P is the sidereal rotation period and Y is the orbital period. Wait, but I need to make sure about the signs. 

The general formula for the solar day is 1/( (1/P) - (1/Y) ) if the rotation and orbital directions are the same. If they are opposite, then it's 1/( (1/P) + (1/Y) ). 

So, for Venus, P is 243 days (sidereal rotation period), and Y is 225 days (orbital period). Since they are in opposite directions, the solar day is 1/( (1/243) + (1/225) ). 

Calculating that: 1/243 ≈ 0.004115, 1/225 ≈ 0.004444. Sum is ≈ 0.008559. Then 1/0.008559 ≈ 116.8 days. So, the solar day on Venus is about 116.8 Earth days. 

So, that's longer than Earth's solar day of 24 hours. Therefore, a day on Venus (solar day) is longer than a day on Earth. 

But wait, if the question is about the sidereal day, then Venus's sidereal day is 243 Earth days, which is longer than Earth's sidereal day of ~23.93 hours. So, in that case, yes, a day on Venus is longer. 

But the problem is that the term "day" can be ambiguous. However, in common usage, when people refer to a day on a planet, they usually mean the solar day. For example, a day on Mars is about 24.6 hours, which is the solar day. 

So, if we take the solar day, then Venus's solar day is 116.8 Earth days, which is longer than Earth's 24 hours. Therefore, the answer would be Yes. 

But I need to confirm the numbers. Let me check some sources. 

According to NASA's fact sheet on Venus: The sidereal rotation period is 243.025 days, and the solar day is 116.75 Earth days. So, the solar day is indeed about 116.75 days. 

So, if the question is about the solar day, then yes, a day on Venus is longer than a day on Earth. However, if it's about the sidereal day, then Venus's day is longer. But since the solar day is the more common definition of a day in terms of how long it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky, which is what we experience on Earth, then the answer would be Yes. 

Therefore, the answer is Yes.

Yes. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Definition of a Day:** A day is typically defined as the time it takes for a planet to complete one full rotation on its axis relative to the Sun (solar day). However, the sidereal day (rotation relative to distant stars) is also used in astronomy.

2. **Earth's Day:**  
   - **Solar Day:** 24 hours (standard Earth day).  
   - **Sidereal Day:** ~23 hours, 56 minutes (shorter due to Earth's orbital motion).

3. **Venus's Rotation:**  
   - **Sidereal Rotation Period:** ~243 Earth days (longer than Earth's sidereal day).  
   - **Solar Day:** ~116.75 Earth days (calculated using the formula for solar day when rotation and orbital directions are opposite: $ \frac{1}{\frac{1}{P} + \frac{1}{Y}} $, where $ P = 243 $ days and $ Y = 225 $ days).

4. **Comparison:**  
   - **Solar Day on Venus (116.75 Earth days)** is **longer** than Earth's solar day (24 hours).  
   - **Sidereal Day on Venus (243 Earth days)** is also **longer** than Earth's sidereal day.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   Whether using the solar or sidereal definition, a day on Venus lasts longer than a day on Earth. The most common interpretation (solar day) confirms the answer.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
