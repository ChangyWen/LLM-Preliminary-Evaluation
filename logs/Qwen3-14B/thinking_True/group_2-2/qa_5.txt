Okay, so I need to figure out if Australia is larger in area than Russia. Let me start by recalling what I know about the sizes of countries. I remember that Russia is the largest country in the world by area, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, isn't Canada also a big country? Maybe I should check the exact numbers.

First, I should get the area of Australia. I think Australia is around 7.6 million square kilometers. But I'm not 100% certain. Then Russia's area... I've heard that Russia is about 17 million square kilometers. If that's the case, then Russia is much larger than Australia. But maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the top countries by area are Russia, Canada, USA, China, Brazil, Australia, India, etc. So if Russia is first, then Canada is second, and Australia is way down the list. So Australia can't be bigger than Russia. But to be sure, I need to confirm the exact figures.

Looking up the approximate areas: Russia is approximately 17,098,242 square kilometers. Australia is about 7,692,024 square kilometers. Comparing these two numbers, Russia is almost double the size of Australia. Therefore, Australia is not larger than Russia. The answer should be No.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Countries in Question:**  
   - Australia and Russia.

2. **Recall General Knowledge of Country Sizes:**  
   - Russia is widely recognized as the largest country in the world by land area.  
   - Australia is a large country but not among the top few in global rankings.

3. **Check Approximate Area Figures:**  
   - **Russia:** ~17.1 million square kilometers (17,098,242 km²).  
   - **Australia:** ~7.7 million square kilometers (7,692,024 km²).  

4. **Compare the Two Areas:**  
   - Russia’s area is approximately **2.2 times larger** than Australia’s.  

5. **Conclusion:**  
   - Since Russia’s area is significantly greater than Australia’s, Australia is **not** larger in area than Russia.

**Final Answer:** No.
