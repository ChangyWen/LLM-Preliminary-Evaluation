Okay, let's see. The question is whether the atomic number of carbon is higher than that of oxygen. Hmm, I need to recall what atomic numbers are. The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus, right? So each element has a unique atomic number.

Carbon... I remember that the periodic table is ordered by atomic number. Let me think about the order of elements. Hydrogen is 1, helium 2, then lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon... Wait, carbon is number 6. Then nitrogen is 7, oxygen is 8. So carbon is 6, oxygen is 8. So carbon's atomic number is lower than oxygen's. Therefore, the answer would be no, carbon's atomic number isn't higher than oxygen's. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up the order. Let me count again. Hydrogen (1), helium (2), lithium (3), beryllium (4), boron (5), carbon (6), nitrogen (7), oxygen (8). Yes, that's correct. So carbon is 6, oxygen is 8. So 6 is less than 8. Therefore, the answer is no.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
The atomic number of an element corresponds to the number of protons in its nucleus. Carbon (C) has an atomic number of **6**, while oxygen (O) has an atomic number of **8**. Since 6 is less than 8, carbon's atomic number is **not** higher than that of oxygen.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Atomic Number Definition:** The atomic number is the count of protons in an atom's nucleus.
2. **Carbon's Atomic Number:** Carbon is the 6th element in the periodic table, so its atomic number is **6**.
3. **Oxygen's Atomic Number:** Oxygen is the 8th element in the periodic table, so its atomic number is **8**.
4. **Comparison:** 6 (carbon) < 8 (oxygen).

**Final Answer:** No.
