Okay, so the question is whether an eagle is faster than a peregrine falcon. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to recall what I know about the speeds of these birds. I remember that the peregrine falcon is often cited as the fastest bird. But I should verify that. I think they can dive at very high speeds, maybe even over 200 miles per hour. Wait, but that's during a dive, right? So maybe their top speed is during a dive, not in level flight.

Now, eagles. I know that bald eagles and golden eagles are large birds of prey. I think their top speeds in level flight are around 50-60 miles per hour. But I'm not sure. Maybe they can go faster when diving too? But I don't think they can match the peregrine's dive speed.

Wait, the peregrine falcon's dive speed, called a stoop, is indeed the fastest. I've heard numbers like 240 mph or even up to 280 mph. But that's during a dive. In level flight, their speed is lower, maybe around 40-50 mph. So if the question is about speed in general, it depends on the context. If it's about diving speed, then peregrine is faster. If it's about level flight, maybe the eagle is slower.

But the question just says "faster" without specifying. So I need to check if the peregrine's dive speed is considered when comparing. Since the peregrine's dive speed is the highest recorded for any bird, even though it's not in level flight, that's still their top speed. So if the question is about maximum speed, then the peregrine is faster. But if it's about level flight speed, then maybe the eagle is slower.

But the user didn't specify the context. However, in general, when people talk about the speed of birds, they often refer to their maximum speed, which for the peregrine is the dive speed. So the answer would be no, the eagle is not faster than the peregrine falcon. The peregrine is faster, especially during a dive. Even in level flight, the peregrine might be faster than the eagle. Wait, I need to check the level flight speeds again.

Looking up in my memory, the peregrine falcon's level flight speed is around 40-50 mph, similar to eagles. But some sources say that the peregrine can reach up to 60 mph in level flight. However, the eagle's top speed in level flight is around 50-60 mph. So maybe they are comparable in level flight, but the peregrine's dive speed is way higher. But the question is whether the eagle is faster than the peregrine. If the peregrine's maximum speed (dive) is higher, then the answer is no. But if the question is about level flight, maybe they are similar. However, the peregrine's dive speed is the highest, so overall, the peregrine is faster.

Therefore, the answer is no, the eagle is not faster than the peregrine falcon.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Birds:** The question compares the speed of an eagle (e.g., bald or golden eagle) to a peregrine falcon.

2. **Peregrine Falcon's Speed:**  
   - **Dive Speed (Stoop):** The peregrine falcon is renowned for its diving speed, reaching **200–240 mph (320–390 km/h)** during a stoop. This is the fastest recorded speed of any animal.  
   - **Level Flight:** In level flight, peregrines typically fly **40–50 mph (64–80 km/h)**.

3. **Eagle's Speed:**  
   - **Level Flight:** Eagles (e.g., bald or golden) have a top speed of **50–60 mph (80–97 km/h)** in level flight.  
   - **Dive Speed:** While eagles can dive at high speeds (e.g., 100–150 mph), this is significantly slower than the peregrine's stoop.

4. **Comparison Context:**  
   - If comparing **maximum speeds**, the peregrine's dive speed (200–240 mph) far exceeds the eagle's dive or level flight speeds.  
   - If comparing **level flight speeds**, eagles may match or slightly exceed peregrines (50–60 mph vs. 40–50 mph), but this is not the peregrine's peak capability.

5. **Conclusion:** The peregrine falcon's **maximum speed (during a dive)** is significantly higher than any recorded speed of an eagle. Thus, the eagle is not faster than the peregrine falcon in terms of overall speed.

**Final Answer:** No.
