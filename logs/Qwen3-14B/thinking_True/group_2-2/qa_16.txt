Okay, let's see. The question is whether the freezing point of water is higher than the boiling point of water. Hmm, I need to recall what those temperatures are. 

First, I remember that the freezing point of water is when it turns from liquid to solid. I think that's 0 degrees Celsius. And the boiling point is when it turns from liquid to gas, which I believe is 100 degrees Celsius. Wait, but that's at standard atmospheric pressure, right? Like at sea level. So if that's the case, then the freezing point is 0°C and the boiling point is 100°C. 

So comparing those two numbers, 0 is definitely lower than 100. So the freezing point is lower than the boiling point. Therefore, the answer would be No, the freezing point isn't higher than the boiling point. 

But wait, maybe there's something I'm missing. Like, under different pressures, the boiling point can change. For example, at higher altitudes, the boiling point is lower because the atmospheric pressure is lower. But the question doesn't specify any particular pressure. I think by default, we're talking about standard pressure, which is 1 atmosphere. So under standard conditions, the freezing point is 0°C and boiling is 100°C. 

Another thought: sometimes people use Fahrenheit. But the question doesn't specify units. However, in scientific contexts, Celsius is standard. But even if we convert, 0°C is 32°F, and 100°C is 212°F. Still, 32 is less than 212. So regardless of the unit, the freezing point is lower. 

So yeah, the answer should be No. The freezing point of water is not higher than its boiling point. It's actually much lower.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Standard Temperatures:**
   - The **freezing point** of water at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm) is **0°C** (32°F).
   - The **boiling point** of water at standard atmospheric pressure is **100°C** (212°F).

2. **Compare the Two Values:**
   - **0°C (freezing point)** is **less than** **100°C (boiling point)**.

3. **Consider Units and Context:**
   - The question does not specify units, but scientific standards use Celsius. Even in Fahrenheit, 32°F (freezing) is less than 212°F (boiling).

4. **Account for Pressure Variations:**
   - While boiling points vary with pressure (e.g., lower at high altitudes), the question implies standard conditions (1 atm). Freezing point remains 0°C regardless of pressure.

**Final Answer:** No.
