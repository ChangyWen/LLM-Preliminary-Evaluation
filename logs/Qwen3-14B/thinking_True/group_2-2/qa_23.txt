Okay, let's see. The question is whether the pH of water is lower than that of lemon juice. Hmm, I need to remember what pH means. pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a substance is. The scale goes from 0 to 14, right? With 7 being neutral. So, below 7 is acidic, and above 7 is basic.

Wait, water is neutral, so its pH should be 7. But wait, isn't pure water exactly 7? But sometimes people talk about tap water or distilled water. Maybe there's a difference there. But I think the standard is that pure water has a pH of 7. Now, lemon juice is acidic because it contains citric acid. So, acids have a pH lower than 7. So, if lemon juice is acidic, its pH would be less than 7. Therefore, water's pH is 7, and lemon juice is lower than that. Wait, but the question is asking if water's pH is lower than lemon juice. So if water is 7 and lemon juice is, say, 2, then water's pH is higher, not lower. So the answer would be no. Wait, but I need to make sure I'm not mixing up the numbers. Let me think again.

Lower pH means more acidic. So lemon juice is more acidic than water. Therefore, lemon juice has a lower pH than water. So the pH of water is higher than that of lemon juice. Therefore, the answer is no, the pH of water is not lower than lemon juice. It's higher. So the answer should be No.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding pH Scale:**  
   - pH measures acidity/basicity on a scale from 0 (most acidic) to 14 (most basic).  
   - A pH of 7 is neutral (pure water at 25°C).  
   - Substances with pH < 7 are acidic; pH > 7 are basic.

2. **Water's pH:**  
   - Pure water has a pH of **7** (neutral).  
   - Tap water may slightly vary (e.g., slightly acidic or basic due to dissolved minerals), but it is generally close to 7.

3. **Lemon Juice's pH:**  
   - Lemon juice contains citric acid, making it **acidic**.  
   - Its pH is typically around **2–3**, which is significantly lower than 7.

4. **Comparison:**  
   - Water (pH ≈ 7) is **less acidic** than lemon juice (pH ≈ 2–3).  
   - Therefore, **water's pH is higher** than lemon juice's pH.

**Final Answer:** No.
