Okay, so the question is whether an elephant has a larger heart than a blue whale. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about the sizes of these animals and their hearts.

First, I know that blue whales are the largest animals on Earth. They can grow up to around 100 feet long and weigh as much as 200 tons. Elephants, on the other hand, are the largest land animals. The African bush elephant can be about 20-25 feet long and weigh up to 6 tons. So, the blue whale is way bigger than the elephant. But the question is about their hearts, not their overall size.

Now, I remember that the size of an animal's heart is generally proportional to its body size. Larger animals need bigger hearts to pump blood through their larger bodies. But I also recall that the blue whale's heart is one of the largest in the animal kingdom. I think it's something like the size of a car or a small car. Wait, I've heard that the blue whale's heart can be as big as a car's engine. But how does that compare to an elephant's heart?

Let me think about the elephant's heart. Elephants are large, so their hearts must be big too. I think an elephant's heart is about the size of a watermelon. Maybe around 20-30 pounds? I'm not sure. But the blue whale's heart is way bigger. I remember reading that the blue whale's heart can weigh around 1,000 pounds or more. If that's the case, then the blue whale's heart is definitely larger than an elephant's.

Wait, but I should check if I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me try to recall specific figures. The blue whale's heart is about 1,500 pounds (around 680 kg) and is about the size of a small car. An elephant's heart, on the other hand, is much smaller. For example, an African elephant's heart might weigh around 25-30 kg, which is about 55-66 pounds. That's way smaller than the blue whale's heart. So even though the elephant is the largest land animal, the blue whale, being the largest overall, has a much larger heart.

Another point to consider is the heart's function. The blue whale's heart has to pump blood through a massive body, which is why it's so large. The elephant's heart, while large for a land animal, is still smaller in comparison. Also, the blue whale's heart is the largest known in the animal kingdom, so that would make it bigger than any other animal's heart, including the elephant's.

I think I've got it. The blue whale's heart is significantly larger than an elephant's. So the answer should be No, the elephant does not have a larger heart than a blue whale.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Compare Body Sizes:**  
   - **Blue Whale:** The largest animal on Earth, reaching lengths of ~100 feet (30 meters) and weights of ~200 tons (180 metric tonnes).  
   - **Elephant:** The largest land animal, with African bush elephants reaching ~25 feet (7.5 meters) and weights of ~6 tons (5.4 metric tonnes).  
   - **Conclusion:** The blue whale is vastly larger than the elephant.

2. **Heart Size Proportionality:**  
   - Larger animals generally have proportionally larger hearts to circulate blood through their bodies.  
   - The **blue whale's heart** is the largest known in the animal kingdom, weighing **~1,500 pounds (680 kg)** and being **~3 feet (90 cm) long**.  
   - The **elephant's heart** is significantly smaller, weighing **~25–30 kg (55–66 pounds)** and being roughly the size of a watermelon.

3. **Direct Comparison:**  
   - The blue whale's heart is **~20–30 times heavier** than an elephant's heart.  
   - The blue whale's heart is also **much larger in physical dimensions** (e.g., comparable to a car engine vs. a watermelon).

4. **Biological Context:**  
   - The blue whale's heart must pump blood through a body 30 times heavier than an elephant's, necessitating its enormous size.  
   - No other animal, including the elephant, has a heart as large as the blue whale's.

**Final Answer:** No.
