Okay, so I need to figure out if the Gobi Desert is hotter than the Sahara Desert. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two deserts. The Sahara is in North Africa, and the Gobi is in Asia, spanning parts of China and Mongolia. Both are large deserts, but I think the Sahara is more famous for being extremely hot. But I'm not sure about the exact temperatures.

First, I should check the average temperatures of both deserts. I remember that the Sahara has some of the highest temperatures on Earth. I think the highest recorded temperature was in the Sahara, maybe around 58°C (136°F) in Libya. But I need to confirm that. On the other hand, the Gobi Desert is a cold desert, right? Wait, cold desert? So maybe it's not as hot as the Sahara. But I'm a bit confused because deserts are usually associated with heat, but some are cold.

Wait, the Gobi is a cold desert, meaning it has low precipitation and cold temperatures, especially at night. The Sahara is a hot desert with high temperatures. So maybe the Gobi doesn't get as hot as the Sahara. But I should check the average maximum temperatures. For example, the Sahara's average maximum temperature might be around 40-45°C, while the Gobi's average maximum might be lower, maybe around 30-35°C. But I need to be precise here.

I should also consider the difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures. In the Gobi, nights can be very cold, but during the day, maybe it's still hot. However, the Sahara is known for scorching days. Another point is that the Sahara is mostly in a subtropical high-pressure zone, leading to clear skies and intense solar radiation, which contributes to high temperatures. The Gobi, being in a more temperate zone, might not have the same level of solar intensity.

Wait, but the Gobi is in a continental climate, so it can have extreme temperature variations between day and night. However, the highest temperatures recorded in the Gobi might not reach the extremes of the Sahara. For example, the highest temperature in the Gobi might be around 45°C, but I'm not sure. I need to verify this. Alternatively, maybe the Gobi's average temperatures are lower than the Sahara's.

Another angle: the Sahara is the largest hot desert, and the Gobi is the largest cold desert. So their classifications as hot vs. cold might indicate their temperature ranges. If the Sahara is a hot desert, it's expected to be hotter than a cold desert like the Gobi. Therefore, the answer would be No, the Gobi is not hotter than the Sahara. But I need to make sure there's no exception or specific region in the Gobi that's hotter than the Sahara.

Wait, but maybe the Gobi has some areas that are hotter? I think the Sahara has more consistent high temperatures, while the Gobi's temperatures vary more. So even if the Gobi has some hot days, the average or the maximums in the Sahara are higher. Also, the Sahara's record temperatures are higher than any recorded in the Gobi. So putting it all together, the answer is No, the Gobi Desert is not hotter than the Sahara Desert.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Desert Classification:**  
   - The **Sahara Desert** is classified as a **hot desert**, characterized by extremely high daytime temperatures and low precipitation.  
   - The **Gobi Desert** is classified as a **cold desert**, known for significant temperature fluctuations (hot days and cold nights) and low rainfall.  

2. **Temperature Extremes:**  
   - The **Sahara** holds the record for the highest reliably measured temperature on Earth: **58°C (136°F)** in Libya (1922).  
   - The **Gobi** has recorded temperatures up to **45°C (113°F)**, but these are not as extreme as the Sahara.  

3. **Average Temperatures:**  
   - The **Sahara** has average maximum temperatures of **40–45°C (104–113°F)** during the day.  
   - The **Gobi** has lower average maximum temperatures, typically **30–35°C (86–95°F)**, with colder nights (sometimes below freezing).  

4. **Climate Context:**  
   - The Sahara’s location in a subtropical high-pressure zone leads to intense solar radiation and minimal cloud cover, amplifying heat.  
   - The Gobi’s continental climate results in extreme diurnal temperature variations but does not sustain the same level of sustained high temperatures as the Sahara.  

5. **Conclusion:**  
   - While the Gobi experiences hot days, its **maximum temperatures and overall heat intensity are lower** than the Sahara’s. The Sahara’s classification as a hot desert and its record-breaking temperatures confirm it is hotter.  

**Final Answer:** No.
