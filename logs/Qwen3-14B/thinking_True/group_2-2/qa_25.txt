Okay, so I need to figure out if the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is less than that on the Moon. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about gravity. I remember that the acceleration due to gravity on a planet's surface depends on the planet's mass and radius. The formula is something like g = GM/R², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the celestial body, and R is its radius.

First, I should check the values for Earth and the Moon. Let me think. Earth's mass is much larger than the Moon's, right? But the Moon is also much smaller in radius. So even though the Moon has less mass, its radius is smaller, which might affect the acceleration. Wait, but how do these factors balance out?

Let me get the exact numbers. Earth's mass is about 5.97 × 10^24 kg, and the Moon's mass is approximately 7.35 × 10^22 kg. That's roughly 81 times less than Earth's mass. Now, the radius of Earth is about 6,371 km, and the Moon's radius is around 1,737 km. So Earth's radius is about 3.66 times larger than the Moon's.

Using the formula g = GM/R², let's plug in the numbers. For Earth, g_earth = (6.67 × 10^-11 N·m²/kg² * 5.97 × 10^24 kg) / (6,371,000 m)². For the Moon, g_moon = (6.67 × 10^-11 * 7.35 × 10^22) / (1,737,000 m)².

But maybe I don't need to calculate the exact values. I can compare the ratios. Let's see. The Moon's mass is 1/81 of Earth's, but its radius is 1/3.66 of Earth's. So the ratio of accelerations would be (M_moon / M_earth) * (R_earth / R_moon)². Plugging in the numbers: (1/81) * (3.66)². Let me compute that. 3.66 squared is approximately 13.39. Then 13.39 divided by 81 is roughly 0.165. So the Moon's gravity is about 1/6th of Earth's. Wait, 0.165 is roughly 1/6 (which is 0.166...). So that makes sense. So the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is about 1.62 m/s², while on Earth it's 9.81 m/s². Therefore, Earth's gravity is stronger than the Moon's. So the question is asking if Earth's gravity is less than the Moon's. The answer would be No, because Earth's gravity is actually more than the Moon's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. If the Moon's gravity is 1/6th of Earth's, then Earth's is 6 times more. So yes, Earth's acceleration due to gravity is greater than the Moon's. Therefore, the answer is No, it's not less.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Formula for Acceleration Due to Gravity:**  
   The acceleration due to gravity on a celestial body is given by:  
   $$
   g = \frac{GM}{R^2}
   $$  
   where $ G $ is the gravitational constant, $ M $ is the mass of the body, and $ R $ is its radius.

2. **Compare Earth and Moon Parameters:**  
   - **Mass:**  
     - Earth: $ M_{\text{Earth}} \approx 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} $  
     - Moon: $ M_{\text{Moon}} \approx 7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg} $  
     - Ratio: $ \frac{M_{\text{Moon}}}{M_{\text{Earth}}} \approx \frac{1}{81} $  

   - **Radius:**  
     - Earth: $ R_{\text{Earth}} \approx 6,371 \, \text{km} $  
     - Moon: $ R_{\text{Moon}} \approx 1,737 \, \text{km} $  
     - Ratio: $ \frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{Moon}}} \approx 3.66 $  

3. **Calculate the Ratio of Gravitational Accelerations:**  
   Using the formula:  
   $$
   \frac{g_{\text{Moon}}}{g_{\text{Earth}}} = \frac{M_{\text{Moon}}}{M_{\text{Earth}}} \times \left( \frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{Moon}}} \right)^2
   $$  
   Substituting values:  
   $$
   \frac{g_{\text{Moon}}}{g_{\text{Earth}}} \approx \frac{1}{81} \times (3.66)^2 \approx \frac{1}{81} \times 13.39 \approx 0.165
   $$  
   This means $ g_{\text{Moon}} \approx 0.165 \times g_{\text{Earth}} $, or about $ 1/6 $ of Earth's gravity.

4. **Known Values:**  
   - $ g_{\text{Earth}} \approx 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 $  
   - $ g_{\text{Moon}} \approx 1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2 $  

5. **Conclusion:**  
   Since $ g_{\text{Earth}} > g_{\text{Moon}} $, the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is **greater** than that on the Moon.

**Final Answer:** No.
