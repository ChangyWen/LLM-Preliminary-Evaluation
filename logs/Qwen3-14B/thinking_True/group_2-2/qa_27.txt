Okay, let's see. The question is whether the boiling point of water is lower than the melting point of ice. Hmm. First, I need to recall what the boiling point and melting point of water are. 

I remember that the melting point of ice is the temperature at which ice turns into water. I think that's 0 degrees Celsius. Right, because when you heat ice, it melts at 0°C. And the boiling point of water is when it turns into vapor. I believe that's 100 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure. So, if the melting point is 0°C and the boiling point is 100°C, then the boiling point is definitely higher than the melting point. 

Wait, but the question is asking if the boiling point is lower than the melting point. So if boiling is 100 and melting is 0, then 100 is not lower than 0. So the answer would be no. But maybe I should double-check these temperatures. 

Let me think. Under standard pressure (which is 1 atm), water boils at 100°C and melts at 0°C. So yes, the boiling point is higher. Therefore, the boiling point is not lower than the melting point. So the answer is no. 

But wait, could there be any conditions where the boiling point is lower? Like at high altitudes, the boiling point of water decreases because the atmospheric pressure is lower. But the melting point of ice is still 0°C, right? Even at high altitudes, the melting point of ice is still 0°C. So even if the boiling point is lower, say 95°C at a high altitude, it's still higher than 0°C. So regardless of pressure, the boiling point of water is always higher than the melting point of ice. 

Wait, but maybe if you change the pressure? For example, if you have very high pressure, does the boiling point increase? Yes, but even then, the melting point of ice is 0°C. So even if the boiling point is higher, it's still higher than 0. So in all cases, the boiling point is higher than the melting point. Therefore, the answer is no, the boiling point is not lower than the melting point of ice.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Define Key Terms:**
   - **Melting Point of Ice:** The temperature at which ice transitions to liquid water. At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), this is **0°C**.
   - **Boiling Point of Water:** The temperature at which water transitions to vapor. At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), this is **100°C**.

2. **Compare the Two Temperatures:**
   - The boiling point (100°C) is **higher** than the melting point (0°C) under standard conditions.

3. **Consider External Factors:**
   - **Pressure Changes:** 
     - At higher altitudes (lower atmospheric pressure), the boiling point of water decreases (e.g., ~95°C at 2,000 meters). However, the melting point of ice remains **0°C** regardless of pressure.
     - Even under extreme pressures, the boiling point of water is always **greater than 0°C**.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The boiling point of water is **always higher** than the melting point of ice under all standard and non-standard pressure conditions.

**Final Answer:** No.
