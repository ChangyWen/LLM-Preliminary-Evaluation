Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the discovery of the DNA structure came before the discovery of penicillin. I need to figure out the timeline of these two events.

First, I should recall when penicillin was discovered. I think Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum had killed bacteria in a petri dish. That's a key point. But I should double-check that date to be sure.

Now, the DNA structure. The famous discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA is usually attributed to James Watson and Francis Crick, along with Rosalind Franklin's work. I remember that they published their findings in 1953. But wait, was that the first time the structure was discovered? Or were there earlier contributions? For example, maybe someone else had proposed a model before 1953? But I think Watson and Crick's work in 1953 is the most well-known and the one that established the double-helix model. 

So, putting the dates together: penicillin was discovered in 1928, and DNA structure in 1953. That would mean penicillin was discovered first. Therefore, the answer should be No, the DNA structure was discovered after penicillin. 

Wait, but I should make sure there's no confusion here. Let me confirm the dates again. Penicillin discovery by Fleming in 1928. Then, the DNA structure by Watson and Crick in 1953. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is No, DNA structure was discovered after penicillin.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Penicillin Discovery:**  
   - Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in **1928**. He observed that the mold *Penicillium notatum* inhibited bacterial growth, leading to the development of the first antibiotic.

2. **DNA Structure Discovery:**  
   - The structure of DNA (double-helix model) was elucidated by **James Watson and Francis Crick** in **1953**, with critical contributions from Rosalind Franklin's X-ray diffraction data.

3. **Timeline Comparison:**  
   - Penicillin was discovered in **1928**, while the DNA structure was discovered in **1953**. This places the discovery of penicillin **25 years earlier** than the DNA structure.

**Final Answer:**  
No.
