Okay, let's try to figure out if Williamsburg in Manhattan is south of Hillman Houses in Manhattan. Hmm, first, I need to recall where these places are located. Wait, Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. But the user mentioned Manhattan, so maybe there's a confusion here. Let me confirm that.

Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City. Manhattan is a separate borough. So if the question is about Williamsburg, Manhattan, that might be a mistake. But assuming the user meant Williamsburg in Brooklyn, but the question says Manhattan. Maybe there's a place called Williamsburg in Manhattan? I don't think so. Let me check my knowledge. No, Williamsburg is definitely in Brooklyn. So perhaps the user made an error in the location.

Now, Hillman Houses. I think Hillman Houses are a public housing complex in Manhattan. Let me think. Hillman Houses are located in the East Harlem area of Manhattan. So if Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, then it's not in Manhattan. Therefore, the question is comparing two places in Manhattan, but Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan. So the answer would be No, because Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan. But the user might have intended to ask about a different location. Alternatively, maybe there's a Williamsburg in Manhattan that I'm not aware of. Let me think again. No, I'm pretty sure Williamsburg is in Brooklyn. So the answer would be No, because Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, so it can't be south of Hillman Houses in Manhattan. Alternatively, if the user meant a different Williamsburg, but I don't think so. So the answer is No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Locations:**
   - **Williamsburg** is a well-known neighborhood in **Brooklyn**, not Manhattan. There is no significant place named "Williamsburg" in Manhattan.
   - **Hillman Houses** are a public housing complex located in **East Harlem**, Manhattan.

2. **Clarify the Question:**
   - The question asks if **Williamsburg, Manhattan** is south of **Hillman Houses, Manhattan**. However, **Williamsburg is not in Manhattan**. This appears to be a geographical error or confusion.

3. **Geographical Context:**
   - If the question intended to compare **Williamsburg (Brooklyn)** with **Hillman Houses (Manhattan)**, they are in different boroughs. Brooklyn and Manhattan are separated by the East River, with Brooklyn to the east and south of Manhattan. However, this does not directly answer the original question about their relative positions within Manhattan.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since **Williamsburg is not located in Manhattan**, the premise of the question is invalid. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether it is south of Hillman Houses in Manhattan.

**Final Answer:** No.
