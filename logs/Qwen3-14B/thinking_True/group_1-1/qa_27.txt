Okay, so I need to figure out if the population of ZIP code 76234 in Texas is more than that of ZIP code 35473 in Alabama. Let me start by recalling how ZIP codes work. Each ZIP code is a five-digit number that represents a specific geographic area, usually a city or a part of a city. However, the population of a ZIP code can vary widely depending on the size of the area it covers and the density of the population there.

First, I should check if these ZIP codes are valid. 76234 is in Texas, and 35473 is in Alabama. I can confirm that both are valid ZIP codes. Now, the next step is to find the population for each. But how do I get that information? I know that the U.S. Census Bureau provides population data, but they might not have the exact numbers for ZIP codes. Alternatively, there are other sources like the American Community Survey (ACS) which provides estimates for ZIP codes. However, I might not have direct access to those databases right now.

Wait, maybe I can use some general knowledge. Let me think about the cities these ZIP codes correspond to. For 76234, Texas: I can try to recall or look up what city that is. 76234 is in Fort Worth, Texas. Fort Worth is a major city in Texas, part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, which is one of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. So, a ZIP code in Fort Worth might have a significant population. 

Now, 35473 in Alabama. Let me think. Alabama's ZIP codes... 35473 might be in a smaller city. Let me try to remember. Maybe it's in a town like Tuscaloosa? Wait, Tuscaloosa's ZIP codes start with 35401, I think. Alternatively, maybe it's in a smaller town. Let me think of other possibilities. 35473 could be in a rural area or a smaller city. 

Alternatively, I can think about the population density. Texas, especially Fort Worth, is a large city with a high population density. Alabama, depending on the area, might have lower population density. However, without exact numbers, this is just a guess. 

But I need to be more precise. Let me try to recall if I've heard of these ZIP codes before. 76234, Fort Worth, Texas. I know that Fort Worth has a population of over 800,000 people. However, a single ZIP code might not cover the entire city. For example, Fort Worth has multiple ZIP codes. 76234 might be a specific neighborhood. Let me think of the population of that ZIP code. If I can't remember, maybe I can estimate based on the city's total population and the number of ZIP codes. Fort Worth has around 200 ZIP codes, so if the total population is 800,000, each ZIP code might have around 4,000 people on average. But that's a rough estimate. However, some ZIP codes in urban areas might have higher populations. 

On the other hand, 35473 in Alabama. Let me think of the population of Alabama. Alabama's total population is around 5 million. If 35473 is a smaller city or rural area, maybe its population is in the thousands. For example, if it's a small town with a few thousand people, then 76234 in Fort Worth would likely be more populous. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the 2020 Census data. However, I don't have exact numbers here. Another approach: check if these ZIP codes are in urban or rural areas. 76234 is in Fort Worth, which is urban, so likely a higher population. 35473 in Alabama might be in a rural area, which would have a lower population. 

But I need to be careful. Maybe 35473 is in a larger city. Let me try to think of Alabama cities with ZIP codes starting with 354. For example, Tuscaloosa is 35401, and there are other ZIP codes in the 354xx range. Maybe 35473 is in a different part of Alabama. Let me think of the city of Hoover, Alabama. Hoover's ZIP codes start with 35216, 35217, etc. So 35473 is probably not in Hoover. Maybe it's in a smaller town. 

Alternatively, I can think of the population of ZIP code 35473. If I can't find exact numbers, maybe I can use an online source. But since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on my existing knowledge. 

Another angle: the average population of a ZIP code in the U.S. is around 5,000 people. However, urban ZIP codes can be much higher, while rural ones can be lower. So if 76234 is in a major city, it might be in the tens of thousands, while 35473 might be in the thousands. 

Wait, but I need to be more precise. Let me think of specific examples. For instance, ZIP code 75001 in Dallas, Texas, has a population of around 100,000. If 76234 is a similar ZIP code in Fort Worth, maybe it's in the same range. On the other hand, a ZIP code in a small Alabama town might have a population of 5,000 or less. 

Alternatively, maybe 35473 is in a larger city. Let me think of the city of Montgomery, Alabama. Montgomery's ZIP codes start with 36104, 36105, etc. So 35473 is not in Montgomery. Maybe it's in a different part of Alabama. 

Alternatively, I can think of the population of the entire county. For example, if 35473 is in a county with a population of 100,000, and the ZIP code is a small part of that county, maybe it's 10,000. But again, this is speculative. 

Given that I can't access exact data, I have to make an educated guess based on the locations. Fort Worth, Texas, being a major city, likely has ZIP codes with higher populations than a smaller Alabama town. Therefore, I would conclude that 76234, TX is more populous than 35473, AL.
