Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if Anastasia of Sirmium lived longer than William II, Count of Chalon. Hmm, first, I should find out when each of them was born and when they died. Then I can compare their lifespans.

Starting with Anastasia of Sirmium. I remember she was a saint, maybe from the early Christian era. Let me think. Sirmium was a city in the Roman Empire, now in Serbia. She might be a martyr. I think she was martyred in the 4th century. Wait, but when exactly? Maybe around 304 AD? I'm not sure. I should check that. Also, if she was martyred, her death date would be around that time. But I need to confirm her birth date. If she was a young martyr, maybe she was born in the late 3rd century. Let's say she was born around 270 AD and died in 304 AD. That would make her lifespan about 34 years.

Now, William II, Count of Chalon. Chalon is a place in France, I think. The Counts of Chalon were a noble family. William II was probably from the medieval period. Let me recall. The Counts of Chalon were active in the 11th and 12th centuries. William II might have been in the 12th century. Let me check. If I remember correctly, William II of Chalon died in 1152. But when was he born? If he was, say, born around 1100, then he would have lived about 52 years. But I need to be precise here.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact dates. But since I can't access external sources, I have to rely on my memory. Let me think again. Anastasia of Sirmium is associated with the Roman persecution of Christians. The Diocletian persecution was around 303-305 AD. If she was martyred during that time, her death would be around 304 AD. If she was born in 270, that's 34 years. But maybe she was older. Alternatively, if she was born in 280, she would be 24 when she died. But I'm not sure.

For William II, Count of Chalon, I think he was the son of William I. William I of Chalon died in 1127, so William II might have been born around 1100-1110. If he died in 1152, that would make him about 42-52 years old. So if Anastasia died in 304 and William II in 1152, then William II lived much longer. But wait, that can't be right. Wait, Anastasia of Sirmium is a historical figure, but if she died in the 4th century, and William II died in the 12th century, then William II would be much older. But that would mean Anastasia didn't live longer. Wait, but the question is whether Anastasia lived longer than William II. If she died in 304 and he in 1152, then no, he lived longer. But I need to confirm the dates.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the dates. Let me check again. Anastasia of Sirmium is sometimes confused with other saints. There's also a Saint Anastasia of Sirmium, who was martyred in 304 AD. So if she died in 304, and William II died in 1152, then William II lived much longer. Therefore, the answer would be No, Anastasia did not live longer than William II. But I need to be sure about William II's dates. If William II was born in, say, 1100 and died in 1152, he was 52. Anastasia, if born in 270 and died in 304, was 34. So William II lived longer. Therefore, the answer is No.
