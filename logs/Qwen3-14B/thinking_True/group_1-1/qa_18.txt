Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Cambria County, PA is located west of Cattaraugus County, NY. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should probably recall the general locations of these counties. Both are in the northeastern United States. Pennsylvania and New York are neighboring states, so their counties might be adjacent or near each other. But I need to be precise.

Cambria County is in Pennsylvania. I think it's in the western part of Pennsylvania, maybe near the Ohio River? Wait, no, the Ohio River is more to the south. Maybe Cambria is in the central or western part of PA. Let me think. Pittsburgh is in Allegheny County, which is in western PA. Cambria County might be to the north of Pittsburgh? Or maybe to the east? I'm a bit fuzzy here.

Cattaraugus County is in New York. I know that Cattaraugus is in western New York, near the Pennsylvania border. The city of Buffalo is in Erie County, which is to the east of Cattaraugus. So Cattaraugus is probably in the western part of NY, maybe near the Lake Erie area? Wait, no, Lake Erie is more to the west of Buffalo. Cattaraugus County is actually in the southern part of western NY, near the Pennsylvania line. The town of Allegany is in Cattaraugus County, and that's near the PA border.

Now, to determine if Cambria is west of Cattaraugus. Let me try to visualize a map. If I imagine a map of PA and NY, Pennsylvania is to the south of New York. So if Cattaraugus County is in western NY, near the PA border, then Cambria County, if it's in western PA, might be just south of Cattaraugus. But the question is about east-west direction. So if Cattaraugus is in western NY, and Cambria is in western PA, then depending on their exact positions, Cambria could be to the south or maybe slightly east or west.

Wait, maybe I should look up the coordinates or approximate locations. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on memory. Let me think again. Pennsylvania's western border is with Ohio and West Virginia, but near the northern part, it borders New York. So the northern part of PA, like Cambria County, would be near the NY border. Cattaraugus County is in western NY, so if Cambria is in northern PA, then it's directly south of Cattaraugus. But the question is about west. So if Cattaraugus is in western NY, and Cambria is in northern PA, then Cambria would be to the south of Cattaraugus, not west. Therefore, the answer would be No, Cambria is not west of Cattaraugus, but rather south of it.

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up directions. Let me think of a compass. If I'm in Cattaraugus County, NY, which is in western NY, then west of that would be further into NY towards the Lake Erie area? Or maybe towards the Ohio River? No, Lake Erie is to the west of Buffalo. Wait, Cattaraugus is south of Buffalo. So if I go west from Cattaraugus, I'd be heading towards the Pennsylvania border? Or maybe towards the west of NY. Hmm, this is confusing without a map.

Alternatively, think of major cities. Pittsburgh is in PA, and it's in the western part. Cattaraugus County is in NY, near the PA border. If I go from Cattaraugus County towards the west, would that take me into PA? Or is PA to the south? Let me think. The PA-NY border runs roughly along the southern part of NY. So if Cattaraugus is in western NY, then to the south of it is PA. So Cambria County, if it's in PA, would be south of Cattaraugus. Therefore, Cambria is not west of Cattaraugus, but rather south. So the answer would be No.

But wait, maybe there's a part of Cambria that's west of Cattaraugus? I need to be careful. Let me think of the exact locations. Cattaraugus County is in the southern part of western NY, near the PA border. Cambria County is in the north-central part of PA. So if you draw a line from Cattaraugus County towards the west, you'd be going into NY, not PA. Whereas Cambria is to the south of Cattaraugus. Therefore, Cambria is not west of Cattaraugus, but rather south. Hence, the answer is No.
