Okay, let's try to figure out if The Ort Institute in Illinois is located west of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan in Wisconsin. Hmm, first, I need to confirm the locations of both places. 

Wait, The Ort Institute is in Illinois, right? But I'm not sure about the exact city. Maybe it's in Chicago? Or another city in Illinois. Then the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. So I need to compare their geographical positions.

First, I should check the coordinates of both locations. Let me think. Sheboygan, Wisconsin is in the eastern part of Wisconsin, near the Lake Michigan coast. Illinois is to the south of Wisconsin. But the question is about west-east direction. Wait, if The Ort Institute is in Illinois, which is south of Wisconsin, but where exactly in Illinois? If it's in the western part of Illinois, like near the Mississippi River, then it might be west of Sheboygan. But if it's in eastern Illinois, like near Chicago, that's more to the east or northeast of Sheboygan.

Wait, I need to get the exact locations. Let me recall. The University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. The Ort Institute... I'm not sure. Maybe it's a smaller institution. Let me think. I might be mixing up names. There's an Ort Institute in Chicago, Illinois? Or maybe it's a different name. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, like the "Ort" Institute, but I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, maybe The Ort Institute is in another state. Wait, the user specified IL, so Illinois. Let me check. If I can't remember, maybe I can think about the general geography. Sheboygan, Wisconsin is in the central-eastern part of Wisconsin. Illinois is to the south. If The Ort Institute is in Illinois, say in the western part of Illinois, like near the Mississippi River, then it would be west of Sheboygan. But if it's in the eastern part of Illinois, like near Chicago, then it's east of Sheboygan. 

But I need to confirm the exact location of The Ort Institute. Wait, I think there's a place called The Ort Institute in Chicago, Illinois. If that's the case, then Chicago is east of Sheboygan. Because Sheboygan is in eastern Wisconsin, and Chicago is in northeastern Illinois. So if The Ort Institute is in Chicago, then it's east of Sheboygan. Therefore, the answer would be No, it's not west. 

Alternatively, if The Ort Institute is in western Illinois, like near the Mississippi River, then it would be west of Sheboygan. But I need to verify. Let me think. I'm not sure about the exact location of The Ort Institute. Maybe I should check if there's a known Ort Institute in Illinois. Wait, I might be confusing it with another institution. For example, there's the University of Illinois, but that's not Ort. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo, and it's the "Orth" Institute, but I'm not sure. If I can't find the exact location, maybe I should state that. However, assuming that The Ort Institute is in Chicago, Illinois, then the answer would be No. But if it's in another part of Illinois, like Peoria or Rockford, which are west of Chicago, then it might be west of Sheboygan. 

Wait, Sheboygan is in Wisconsin, so if I imagine a map, Wisconsin is north of Illinois. Sheboygan is on the eastern side of Wisconsin, near the border with Michigan. Illinois is to the south. So if The Ort Institute is in western Illinois, like near the Mississippi River, then it's west of Sheboygan. But if it's in eastern Illinois, like near Chicago, then it's east. 

But without knowing the exact location of The Ort Institute, I can't be certain. However, if I assume that the user is referring to a known Ort Institute in Illinois, perhaps in Chicago, then the answer would be No. Alternatively, if it's in a different city, the answer might vary. 

Wait, maybe I can look up the coordinates. But since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. I think the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is located at approximately 43.7569° N, 87.9333° W. If The Ort Institute is in Chicago, Illinois, which is around 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W. Comparing the longitudes: Sheboygan is at 87.9333° W, and Chicago is at 87.6298° W. Since lower longitude numbers are further east, Chicago is east of Sheboygan. Therefore, if The Ort Institute is in Chicago, it's east, so the answer is No. 

But if The Ort Institute is in a city west of Sheboygan, like in western Illinois, then it would be west. However, without knowing the exact location of The Ort Institute, I can't be sure. But given that the user specified IL, and assuming that the Ort Institute is in a major city like Chicago, the answer would be No. However, if the Ort Institute is in a different part of Illinois, the answer might be different. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the name. For example, there's the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh, but that's in Wisconsin. Alternatively, maybe the Ort Institute is in another state. But the user said IL. 

In conclusion, without exact coordinates, but assuming that The Ort Institute is in Chicago, Illinois, the answer is No. However, if it's in a different location in Illinois, the answer could vary. But given the lack of specific information, the safest assumption might be that it's in Chicago, leading to the answer No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Locations:**
   - **University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan (UW–Sheboygan):** Located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Coordinates: ~43.7569° N, 87.9333° W.
   - **The Ort Institute:** Specified as being in Illinois (IL). However, the exact location is unclear. Common assumptions might place it in Chicago, Illinois (a major city in IL), but this is not confirmed.

2. **Geographical Context:**
   - **Sheboygan, WI** is in the **eastern part of Wisconsin**, near the Lake Michigan coast.
   - **Illinois** lies **south of Wisconsin**. The **western part of Illinois** (e.g., near the Mississippi River) is west of Sheboygan, while the **eastern part** (e.g., Chicago) is east of Sheboygan.

3. **Assumption for The Ort Institute:**
   - If The Ort Institute is in **Chicago, IL** (a plausible assumption due to its prominence), its coordinates are ~41.8781° N, 87.6298° W. 
   - Comparing longitudes: Sheboygan (87.9333° W) is **west** of Chicago (87.6298° W), meaning **Chicago is east of Sheboygan**.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - If The Ort Institute is in **Chicago**, it is **east** of UW–Sheboygan. 
   - If it were in **western Illinois** (e.g., near the Mississippi River), it would be **west** of Sheboygan. However, without explicit confirmation of its location, the most likely assumption (based on prominence) is Chicago.

**Final Answer:** No.
