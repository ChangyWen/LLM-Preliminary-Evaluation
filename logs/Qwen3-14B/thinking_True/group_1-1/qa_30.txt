Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Pragser Wildsee is located west of Lake Vico. Hmm, I need to figure out the geographical positions of both lakes.

First, I should recall where these lakes are. Pragser Wildsee sounds familiar. I think it's in the Dolomites, maybe in Italy. Wait, the Dolomites are in northern Italy, part of the Alps. Lake Vico... I'm not as sure about that one. Maybe it's in a different region of Italy or another country?

Let me check. Pragser Wildsee is actually in the Veneto region of Italy, near the Austrian border. It's part of the Dolomites, specifically in the area of the Pale di San Martino. Now, Lake Vico. I think that's in the Marche region of Italy, near the town of San Ginesio. So, if I can figure out their coordinates or relative positions, I can determine which is west of the other.

Alternatively, I can think about the general directions. If Pragser Wildsee is in the Dolomites, which are in the northeast of Italy, and Lake Vico is in the Marche region, which is more central or central-eastern. So, if I imagine a map of Italy, the Dolomites are on the northern side, towards the east. The Marche region is on the east coast, but maybe a bit further south. So, if Pragser Wildsee is in the north-east, and Lake Vico is in the east-central, then Pragser Wildsee would be to the north or northwest of Lake Vico, not necessarily west. Wait, but west is a different direction. If Lake Vico is in the Marche, which is east of the Apennines, and Pragser Wildsee is in the Dolomites, which are in the northeast, then depending on their exact positions, maybe Pragser Wildsee is to the north-west of Lake Vico. But the question is specifically about west. So, if Lake Vico is to the east of Pragser Wildsee, then Pragser Wildsee would be west of it. But I need to confirm their exact locations.

Alternatively, maybe I can look up approximate coordinates. Let me try to remember. Pragser Wildsee is at around 46.5°N, 12.5°E. Lake Vico is in the Marche region, maybe around 42.8°N, 13.2°E. Wait, if that's the case, then Pragser Wildsee is further north and slightly west (since 12.5°E is west of 13.2°E). So, if Lake Vico is at 13.2°E and Pragser Wildsee is at 12.5°E, then Pragser Wildsee is west of Lake Vico. But also, Pragser Wildsee is north of Lake Vico. So, the answer would be yes, it's west. But I need to make sure the coordinates are correct.

Wait, I might be mixing up the coordinates. Let me think again. The Dolomites are in the Veneto region, which is in the northeast of Italy. The coordinates for Pragser Wildsee are approximately 46.5°N, 12.5°E. Lake Vico is in the Marche region, which is in the east-central part of Italy. The coordinates for Lake Vico might be around 42.8°N, 13.2°E. So, comparing the longitudes: 12.5°E (Pragser) vs. 13.2°E (Vico). Since 12.5 is less than 13.2, Pragser is west of Lake Vico. Even though it's further north, the question is about west. So the answer would be yes. But I need to confirm if these coordinates are accurate.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of major cities. For example, Bolzano is in the Dolomites, near Pragser Wildsee. Bolzano is at around 46.5°N, 11.2°E. So Pragser Wildsee is a bit east of Bolzano. If Lake Vico is in the Marche, near San Ginesio, which is east of Rome. Rome is at 41.9°N, 12.5°E. So San Ginesio is east of Rome, maybe around 42.8°N, 13.2°E as I thought. So yes, Pragser Wildsee is at 12.5°E, which is west of 13.2°E. Therefore, Pragser Wildsee is west of Lake Vico. So the answer is yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Locations:**
   - **Pragser Wildsee** is a lake in the **Dolomites**, located in the **Veneto region of northern Italy**, near the Austrian border.
   - **Lake Vico** is a lake in the **Marche region of central-eastern Italy**, near the town of San Ginesio.

2. **Approximate Coordinates:**
   - **Pragser Wildsee**: ~46.5°N, 12.5°E.
   - **Lake Vico**: ~42.8°N, 13.2°E.

3. **Compare Longitudes (East-West Direction):**
   - Longitude measures east-west position. A lower longitude (e.g., 12.5°E) is **west** of a higher longitude (e.g., 13.2°E).
   - Pragser Wildsee (12.5°E) is **west** of Lake Vico (13.2°E).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Despite Pragser Wildsee being further north, its longitude places it **west** of Lake Vico.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
