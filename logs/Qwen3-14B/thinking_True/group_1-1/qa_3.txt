Okay, let's try to figure out whether Elliot Silverstein's "Nightmare Honeymoon" was released later than Peter R. Hunt's "Gold." First, I need to find out the release dates of both movies.

Starting with "Nightmare Honeymoon." I remember that Elliot Silverstein was a director, and this film might be from the 1960s or 1970s. Let me check. A quick search in my mind... Oh, right! "Nightmare Honeymoon" is a 1966 film. It's a horror-comedy, and I think it was released in the mid-60s.

Now, Peter R. Hunt's "Gold." Peter R. Hunt directed "Gold," which I believe is a 1974 film. Wait, but I should confirm. Hunt is known for directing some Bond films, like "On Her Majesty's Secret Service," but "Gold" might be a different project. Let me think. "Gold" is a 1974 British film, a comedy, and it's directed by Peter R. Hunt. So that would be 1974.

Comparing the two release years: 1966 vs. 1974. Since 1974 is later than 1966, "Gold" was released after "Nightmare Honeymoon." Therefore, the answer would be No, because "Nightmare Honeymoon" was released earlier than "Gold."
