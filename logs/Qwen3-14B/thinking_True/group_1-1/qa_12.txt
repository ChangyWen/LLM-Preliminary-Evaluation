Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if Flagler Estates, FL is located south of Palatka, FL. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure where these places are, so I should probably start by recalling or looking up their locations.

First, I know that both Flagler Estates and Palatka are in Florida. But where exactly? Let me think. Palatka is a city in Florida, and I remember that it's in the northern part of the state. Maybe in the area around the St. Johns River? I think Palatka is in Putnam County. Now, Flagler Estates... I'm not as familiar with that. Maybe it's in a different county. Wait, Flagler County is a county in Florida, and I think Flagler Estates might be a city or a town within that county. So if Flagler County is south of Putnam County, then Flagler Estates would be south of Palatka.

But I need to confirm the exact locations. Let me try to visualize a map of Florida. The northern part of Florida has cities like Jacksonville, and then moving south, there's St. Augustine, which is in the northeast. Palatka is further north, maybe near the Georgia border? Wait, no, Georgia is to the north of Florida, but Palatka is in the central part. Let me think about the counties. Putnam County is in the central part of Florida, and Flagler County is to the south of that. So if Palatka is in Putnam County, and Flagler Estates is in Flagler County, then Flagler Estates would be south of Palatka.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about major cities. For example, Daytona Beach is further south, and Flagler County is near there. So if Palatka is in the central part, then Flagler Estates would be south of it. But I should check the approximate coordinates or use a map to be sure.

Another approach: I can recall that the St. Johns River flows through Palatka, and it's a major river in Florida. The river flows from the north to the south, so Palatka is on the river, and moving south along the river would take you towards places like Jacksonville, but maybe Flagler Estates is further south. Wait, no, Jacksonville is to the east. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, I can think of the latitude. If I can find the approximate latitude of both cities, then I can compare. Let me try to remember or estimate. Palatka's latitude is around 30 degrees north, maybe? And Flagler Estates might be around 29 degrees north, which would be south of Palatka. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers.

Wait, I think I can check some approximate coordinates. Let me think. Palatka, FL is in Putnam County, and according to some sources, its coordinates are approximately 30.05° N, 81.75° W. Flagler Estates, FL is in Flagler County, and its coordinates are roughly 29.45° N, 81.45° W. Comparing the latitudes, 29.45° N is south of 30.05° N. Therefore, Flagler Estates is south of Palatka.

But wait, I need to make sure that the coordinates are correct. If I'm mistaken about the coordinates, the answer could be wrong. Let me think again. If Palatka is in the northern part of Florida, and Flagler County is further south, then yes, Flagler Estates would be south. Also, the distance between them: driving directions might show that you go south from Palatka to reach Flagler Estates. Alternatively, if I think of the St. Johns River, Palatka is upstream, and moving downstream (south) along the river would take you towards the Atlantic coast, which is where Flagler County is located.

So putting it all together, based on the approximate coordinates and the geographical positions, Flagler Estates is indeed located south of Palatka.
