Okay, let's try to figure out whether Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy, died later than William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. Hmm, first, I need to find out the dates of death for both individuals. 

Starting with William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. I remember that he was a significant figure in the 12th century. Let me think... I think he was involved in the Crusades. Wait, wasn't he one of the barons who went on the First Crusade? If I recall correctly, he died in 1138. But I should double-check that. Maybe he was born around 1080? So if he died in 1138, that's his death year.

Now, Agnes of Aquitaine. She was the Countess of Savoy. I need to find her dates. I think she was married to Amadeus III of Savoy. Let me see... Amadeus III was Count of Savoy from 1135 until his death in 1152. If Agnes was his wife, she might have died after him. But I'm not sure. Wait, some sources say she died in 1152, the same year as Amadeus III. But maybe she died later? Or perhaps she outlived him? Alternatively, maybe she died in 1153? I need to confirm.

Wait, another angle: Agnes of Aquitaine was the daughter of William IX, Duke of Aquitaine, and his wife, Adela of Anjou. William IX died in 1099, so Agnes would have been born around the late 11th century. If she married Amadeus III, who was Count of Savoy, and they had children, then her death date would be after their marriage. If Amadeus died in 1152, and she died in 1152 as well, then she would have died the same year as him. But if she died later, say 1153 or 1154, then she would have died after William de Warenne, who died in 1138. But if she died in 1152, then she died after 1138, so yes, later than William de Warenne. Wait, but if she died in 1152, that's 14 years after William's death in 1138. So that would mean she died later. But I need to be sure about her exact death date.

Alternatively, maybe she died in 1153. Let me check some sources. From what I remember, Agnes of Aquitaine died in 1152, the same year as her husband Amadeus III. If that's the case, then she died in 1152, which is after William de Warenne's death in 1138. Therefore, the answer would be Yes. But I need to make sure that William de Warenne actually died in 1138. Let me confirm that. William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, was born around 1080 and died in 1138. Yes, that's correct. So if Agnes died in 1152, then she died later than him. Therefore, the answer is Yes.
