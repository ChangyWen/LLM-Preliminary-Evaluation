Okay, so I need to figure out if Peter Hitchens's "The Abolition of Britain" is shorter than Mo Hayder's "Birdman." Let me start by recalling what I know about these books. 

First, I should check the page counts of both books. But I don't remember the exact numbers off the top of my head. Maybe I can think about the authors and their typical writing styles. Peter Hitchens is a journalist and author known for his political commentary, so his books might be non-fiction. "The Abolition of Britain" sounds like a non-fiction political book, possibly a critique of British society or politics. On the other hand, Mo Hayder is a crime fiction author, and "Birdman" is one of her novels. Crime novels can vary in length, but they often range from around 300 to 500 pages. 

Wait, but I need to be precise. Let me try to recall or think of where I might have seen these page counts. I know that non-fiction books can sometimes be shorter than novels, but that's not always the case. For example, some non-fiction books are quite lengthy, while some novels are concise. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the publication dates. "The Abolition of Britain" was published in 2010, I believe. "Birdman" by Mo Hayder was published in 2004. But that might not help with the page count. 

Another approach: check if I can remember any reviews or summaries that mention the length. For instance, if I remember that "Birdman" is a standalone novel, maybe around 300 pages. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can think of similar books. Mo Hayder's other books, like "The Girl in the Ice," are around 300 pages. If "Birdman" is similar, then maybe 300 pages. 

As for Peter Hitchens's book, "The Abolition of Britain" is a non-fiction work. I think it's around 250 pages. If that's the case, then 250 pages would be shorter than 300. But I need to be careful here. Maybe I should check if there's a way to confirm these numbers without looking them up. 

Wait, but since I can't actually look up the page counts right now, I have to rely on my memory. Let me think again. I remember that "The Abolition of Britain" is a relatively short book, maybe around 200-250 pages. Mo Hayder's "Birdman" is a crime novel, which are often longer, but some are shorter. However, I think "Birdman" is a bit longer than 250 pages. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the average page count for each genre. Non-fiction books can vary, but some are concise. Crime novels often have more pages because they include detailed plots, character development, and settings. So if "The Abolition of Britain" is a non-fiction book around 250 pages and "Birdman" is a crime novel around 300 pages, then the answer would be yes. 

But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: sometimes the number of words can be an indicator. If I can estimate the word count. Non-fiction books might be around 50,000-70,000 words, while novels can be 80,000-100,000 words. But that's a rough estimate. If "The Abolition of Britain" is 50,000 words and "Birdman" is 80,000, then the former is shorter. However, word count doesn't directly translate to page count because of formatting and font size. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the authors' other works. For example, Mo Hayder's "The Girl in the Ice" is 320 pages. If "Birdman" is similar, then it's longer than Hitchens's book. 

But I'm still not certain. I think the safest answer based on my current knowledge is that "The Abolition of Britain" is shorter than "Birdman." However, I should note that without exact page counts, this is an educated guess.
