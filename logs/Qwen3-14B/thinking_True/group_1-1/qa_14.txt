Okay, so I need to figure out if Arbuckle, California is less populous than Pickens, South Carolina. Let me start by recalling what I know about these places. First, I should check the population of both cities. But wait, I don't remember the exact numbers off the top of my head. I think Arbuckle is a small town in California, maybe in the Central Valley? And Pickens is a county in South Carolina, but wait, the question says Pickens, SC. Wait, is Pickens a city or a county? Let me confirm that.

Wait, Pickens is actually a county in South Carolina, but there's also a city named Pickens in South Carolina. Hmm, maybe the user is referring to the city of Pickens, SC. But I need to be sure. Let me think. If the user says Pickens, SC, it's possible they mean the city. But sometimes people might confuse counties with cities. However, the question is about population, so I need to check the population of the city of Pickens, SC versus the town of Arbuckle, CA.

First, I should look up the population of Arbuckle, CA. I know that Arbuckle is a small town in California, maybe in Plumas County? Wait, I'm not sure. Let me try to recall. Alternatively, I can think of the 2020 U.S. Census data. Let me try to remember or think of approximate numbers.

Arbuckle, CA: I think it's a very small town. Maybe around a few hundred people? I remember that some small towns in California have populations under 1,000. For example, I think Arbuckle's population is around 300-500 people. But I need to be precise. Alternatively, I can think of the 2020 Census data. Let me try to recall. Wait, I think Arbuckle's population was about 400 in 2020.

Now, Pickens, SC. If it's the city of Pickens, South Carolina, then I need to check its population. I think Pickens is a larger city compared to Arbuckle. Let me think. South Carolina's population is around 5 million, and Pickens County has a population of about 100,000. But the city of Pickens might be the county seat. Let me think. The city of Pickens, SC, according to my memory, has a population of around 10,000 to 15,000 people. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's smaller. Let me think of other cities in South Carolina. For example, Spartanburg is a larger city, but Pickens is smaller. Maybe around 10,000?

Wait, but I need to be accurate. Let me try to recall. If I can't remember, maybe I can use some logic. If Arbuckle is a small town in California, and Pickens is a city in South Carolina, it's possible that Pickens is more populous. But I need to confirm the numbers.

Alternatively, I can think of the 2020 Census data. Let me try to recall. For example, the city of Pickens, SC, according to the 2020 Census, had a population of 10,215. Arbuckle, CA, according to the 2020 Census, had a population of 402. If that's the case, then yes, Arbuckle is less populous than Pickens.

But wait, I need to make sure I'm not confusing the county with the city. If the user meant Pickens County, SC, then the population would be around 100,000, which is way more than Arbuckle. But the question says "Pickens, SC," which is more likely the city. However, sometimes people refer to counties by their seat. But the user specifically wrote "Pickens, SC," so I think it's the city.

Another way to check: if I think of the city of Pickens, SC, it's in Pickens County. The city's population is around 10,000, as per my previous thought. Arbuckle, CA, is a much smaller town. Therefore, the answer would be yes, Arbuckle is less populous than Pickens, SC.
