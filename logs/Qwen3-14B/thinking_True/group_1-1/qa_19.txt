Okay, I need to figure out if Eau Claire County, Wisconsin is more populous than Platte County, Missouri. Let me start by recalling how to find population data for counties. I think the best source is the U.S. Census Bureau, specifically their latest population estimates. Since the question doesn't specify a year, I should use the most recent data available, probably from the 2020 census or the latest estimates from around 2023.

First, I'll try to remember or look up the population of Eau Claire County, WI. I know that Eau Claire is a city in Wisconsin, and the county might have a population around 100,000 to 150,000. Wait, but I need to be precise. Let me think. I recall that the city of Eau Claire itself has a population of about 70,000, but the county includes surrounding areas. Maybe the county's population is around 120,000? Not sure. I should check that.

Now for Platte County, Missouri. Platte County is in the St. Louis metropolitan area, I believe. It's a suburban county. The population might be in the range of 100,000 to 150,000 as well. But I need exact numbers. Let me think. I remember that St. Louis County, MO is much larger, but Platte County is smaller. Maybe around 100,000? Or maybe more?

Wait, I think I can recall that Platte County, MO had a population of about 110,000 as of the 2020 census. And Eau Claire County, WI might be around 120,000. If that's the case, then Eau Claire County would be more populous. But I need to confirm these numbers.

Alternatively, I can think of other sources. Maybe the official county websites or the Census Bureau's QuickFacts. Let me try to recall. For Eau Claire County, WI, according to the 2020 census, the population was 121,545. For Platte County, MO, the 2020 population was 109,815. If these numbers are correct, then Eau Claire County is more populous.

But wait, I should make sure I'm not mixing up the numbers. Let me think again. Another way is to check the approximate populations. Eau Claire is a city with about 70,000 people, and the county includes other towns. If the county's population is around 120k, that seems plausible. Platte County, being part of the St. Louis area, might have a similar or slightly lower population. If the 2020 numbers are as I thought, then the answer is yes. However, if there's a more recent estimate, like 2023, maybe the populations have changed slightly. But unless there's a significant change, the 2020 numbers would still be the most accurate for comparison.

So, based on the 2020 census data, Eau Claire County, WI has a larger population than Platte County, MO. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.
