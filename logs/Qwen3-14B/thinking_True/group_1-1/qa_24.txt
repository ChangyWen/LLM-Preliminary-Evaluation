Okay, so I need to figure out if the ZIP code 83703 in Idaho is less densely populated than ZIP code 79104 in Texas. Let me start by recalling what population density means. It's the number of people per square mile or per square kilometer. So, I need to find the population density for both ZIP codes.

First, I should check the population of each ZIP code. But wait, ZIP codes can cover different areas, and sometimes they might include parts of multiple cities or rural areas. I need to make sure I get accurate data for each. Maybe I can look up the population for each ZIP code. However, I don't have that data memorized, so I need to think about how to find it.

I remember that the U.S. Census Bureau provides population data, but they might not have ZIP code-level data. Alternatively, there are other sources like the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) which might have estimates for ZIP codes. Also, some websites like Zillow or other demographic data sites might have this information. But since I can't access the internet, I need to think if I can estimate or recall any data.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the population of the cities or counties where these ZIP codes are located. Let me think about the locations. ZIP code 83703 is in Idaho. Let me recall that Idaho has several cities, like Boise, but 83703 might be in a different area. Wait, 83703 is actually in the city of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. I think Coeur d'Alene is a city in northern Idaho, near Lake Coeur d'Alene. It's a bit of a tourist spot, so maybe it's a mix of residential and some commercial areas. But I'm not sure about the exact population density.

On the other hand, ZIP code 79104 is in Texas. Let me think about Texas cities. 79104 is in Lubbock, Texas. Lubbock is a city in the Texas Panhandle, known for Texas Tech University. So, Lubbock is a medium-sized city. Now, I need to compare the population density of Coeur d'Alene (ZIP 83703) versus Lubbock (ZIP 79104).

But how do I estimate their population densities? Let me think about the general population densities of these areas. Coeur d'Alene is a city that's not as large as, say, Boise or Seattle. It's a smaller city, but I'm not sure. Lubbock is a city with a population around 250,000 as of recent estimates. Let me check my memory: Lubbock's population is approximately 250,000, and its area is around 100 square miles. So, if that's the case, the population density would be 250,000 divided by 100, which is 2,500 people per square mile. But that's just for the city of Lubbock. However, ZIP code 79104 might not cover the entire city. Maybe it's a specific part of Lubbock, like the downtown area or a residential neighborhood. If it's a more urban area, the density would be higher, but if it's a suburban or rural part, it might be lower. But I need to be careful here.

For Coeur d'Alene, the city's population is around 50,000 to 60,000. Let me think. If the city's area is, say, 20 square miles, then the density would be 50,000 divided by 20, which is 2,500 per square mile. Wait, that's the same as Lubbock. But that can't be right. Maybe I'm mixing up numbers. Let me try again.

Wait, I think Coeur d'Alene's population is around 50,000. If the city's area is, say, 15 square miles, then the density would be 50,000 / 15 â‰ˆ 3,333 per square mile. But Lubbock's density was 2,500. So in that case, Coeur d'Alene would be more densely populated. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, maybe Coeur d'Alene is more spread out. Let me think about the geography. Coeur d'Alene is near a lake, so maybe it has more suburban or lower density areas. Lubbock is a more compact city with a university, so maybe higher density.

Alternatively, maybe I should look up the population of the ZIP codes directly. But since I can't do that, I need to think of another approach. Maybe using the population of the entire city and the area of the ZIP code. For example, if ZIP code 83703 is a part of Coeur d'Alene, and if the entire city has a population of 50,000 and the ZIP code covers, say, 10% of the city's area, then the density would be 5,000 divided by (total area / 10). But without knowing the exact area of the ZIP code, this is speculative.

Alternatively, I can think about the general population density of Idaho versus Texas. Idaho is generally less densely populated than Texas. However, that's at the state level. But individual cities can vary. For example, urban areas in Texas like Houston or Dallas are very dense, but Lubbock is a smaller city. Coeur d'Alene is a smaller city in Idaho, which is a less densely populated state overall. However, the ZIP code might be in a more urban part of the city.

Wait, another thought: ZIP code 83703 in Idaho. Let me check if I can recall any data. I think that Coeur d'Alene's ZIP codes might have varying densities. For example, the downtown area might be more dense, while the suburbs are less. But without specific data, it's hard to tell. Similarly, ZIP code 79104 in Lubbock might be a more urban area with higher density.

Alternatively, I can think about the population per square mile for the entire city. If Coeur d'Alene has a population of 50,000 and an area of 20 square miles, that's 2,500 per square mile. If Lubbock has a population of 250,000 and an area of 100 square miles, that's also 2,500. But if the ZIP code 79104 is a part of Lubbock with higher density, maybe 3,000, while ZIP code 83703 is in a less dense part of Coeur d'Alene, maybe 2,000. Then the answer would be yes, 83703 is less dense. But this is all guesswork.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that Texas has a higher overall population density than Idaho. But again, that's at the state level. However, individual cities can be exceptions. For example, a small city in Texas might have a higher density than a small city in Idaho. But I need to be careful here.

Another approach: think about the population of the ZIP codes. If I can estimate the population of each ZIP code. For example, if ZIP code 79104 in Lubbock has a population of 10,000 and covers 5 square miles, that's 2,000 per square mile. If ZIP code 83703 has a population of 5,000 over 10 square miles, that's 500 per square mile. Then 83703 would be less dense. But again, these numbers are made up.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that Lubbock is a larger city. If the entire city has a population of 250,000 and the ZIP code 79104 is a part of it, maybe it's a significant portion. Suppose the ZIP code has 20,000 people and covers 5 square miles, that's 4,000 per square mile. If Coeur d'Alene's ZIP code 83703 has 5,000 people over 10 square miles, that's 500 per square mile. Then yes, 83703 is less dense. But again, this is all hypothetical.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the fact that Idaho is a more rural state, so even its cities might have lower densities compared to Texas cities. But I'm not sure. For example, if Coeur d'Alene is a city with a lower population density than Lubbock, then the answer would be yes. But I need to be careful not to assume without data.

Wait, I think I remember that Coeur d'Alene has a population density of around 1,500 people per square mile, while Lubbock is around 2,500. If that's the case, then 83703 (Coeur d'Alene) would be less dense than 79104 (Lubbock). But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, maybe the opposite.

Alternatively, I can think about the size of the cities. If Coeur d'Alene is smaller in area but has a similar population to a part of Lubbock, then the density could be higher. But without specific numbers, this is tricky.

Another angle: check if the ZIP codes are in urban or rural areas. 83703 in Idaho: Coeur d'Alene is a city, so it's urban. 79104 in Texas: Lubbock is also a city, so urban. But urban areas can vary in density. Maybe Lubbock is more densely populated because it's a university town with more housing density, while Coeur d'Alene might have more spread-out neighborhoods.

Alternatively, I can think about the population of the ZIP codes. If I can recall that ZIP code 79104 has a higher population than 83703, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, if 79104 is a larger ZIP code area, it might have more people but lower density. Or vice versa.

This is really challenging without actual data. Maybe I should try to find approximate numbers. Let me try to recall or estimate:

- Coeur d'Alene, ID: Population around 50,000. Area: Let's say 20 square miles. Density: 50,000 / 20 = 2,500 per square mile.

- Lubbock, TX: Population around 250,000. Area: 100 square miles. Density: 250,000 / 100 = 2,500 per square mile.

So if both cities have the same density, then the ZIP codes might be similar. But if the ZIP code 79104 is a more urban part of Lubbock, maybe higher density, and 83703 is a more suburban part of Coeur d'Alene, maybe lower density. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, if the ZIP code 83703 is in a more rural part of Idaho, but that's unlikely because it's a ZIP code, which usually corresponds to a city or town. So 83703 is likely in the city of Coeur d'Alene, which is urban.

Another thought: Maybe I can check the population of the ZIP codes using the U.S. Census Bureau's ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). But again, without access to the data, I can't look it up. However, I might remember that some sources indicate that ZIP code 83703 has a population of around 10,000 and ZIP code 79104 has around 15,000. If the area of 83703 is 10 square miles and 79104 is 5 square miles, then 83703 would have 1,000 per square mile and 79104 would have 3,000, making 83703 less dense. But these numbers are just guesses.

Alternatively, if ZIP code 83703 is in a more spread-out area, like a suburban or rural part of Coeur d'Alene, but that's not typical for ZIP codes. ZIP codes in cities are usually more compact.

Given all this uncertainty, I think the safest answer is that without specific data, it's hard to be certain, but based on general knowledge that Idaho is less densely populated than Texas, and assuming that the ZIP codes are representative of their cities, it's possible that 83703 is less densely populated than 79104. However, this is an assumption and not based on concrete data.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether ZIP code 83703 (Idaho) is less densely populated than ZIP code 79104 (Texas), we need to compare their **population densities**, which are calculated as **population per square mile**.

---

### Step 1: Identify the Locations
- **ZIP 83703** is located in **Coeur d'Alene, Idaho**.
- **ZIP 79104** is located in **Lubbock, Texas**.

Both are urban areas, but they are in different states with varying population densities.

---

### Step 2: Estimate Population and Area
Since exact data for ZIP codes is not provided, we use **city-level estimates** as a proxy:

#### Coeur d'Alene, ID (ZIP 83703):
- **Estimated population**: ~50,000 (city-wide).
- **Estimated area**: ~20 square miles.
- **Population density**:  
  $$
  \frac{50,000}{20} = 2,500 \text{ people per square mile}
  $$

#### Lubbock, TX (ZIP 79104):
- **Estimated population**: ~250,000 (city-wide).
- **Estimated area**: ~100 square miles.
- **Population density**:  
  $$
  \frac{250,000}{100} = 2,500 \text{ people per square mile}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Consider ZIP Code Specifics
- **ZIP 83703** may cover a **smaller portion** of Coeur d'Alene, possibly a suburban or less dense area.
- **ZIP 79104** may cover a **more urbanized** or central part of Lubbock, potentially with **higher density**.

If ZIP 83703 is a **suburban or rural** part of Coeur d'Alene, its density could be **lower** than the city average. Conversely, ZIP 79104 might be a **denser urban** area of Lubbock.

---

### Step 4: Conclusion
While both cities have similar **city-wide** population densities (~2,500 per square mile), **ZIP code 83703** (Coeur d'Alene) is likely to be **less densely populated** than **ZIP code 79104** (Lubbock), assuming the latter represents a more urbanized or central area of a larger city.

---

### Final Answer: **Yes**
