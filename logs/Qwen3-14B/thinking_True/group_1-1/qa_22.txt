Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Lake Martin, Alabama is located south of the Dal-Tex Building in Texas. Hmm, first I need to figure out the locations of both places.

Starting with Lake Martin, AL. I know that Lake Martin is a reservoir in Alabama, created by the construction of the Martin Dam on the Coosa River. It's in the southeastern part of the state, maybe near the Georgia border? I think it's in Elmore County, Alabama. So, coordinates might be around 32.5 degrees north latitude, but I'm not sure exactly.

Now, the Dal-Tex Building. I remember that the Dal-Tex Building is a famous skyscraper in Dallas, Texas. It's a historic building, maybe from the 1950s or 60s. Dallas is in the northern part of Texas, so its coordinates would be around 32.7767° N, 96.7989° W. Wait, but Dallas is in the northern part of Texas, so latitude around 32.7 degrees north.

So, Lake Martin, AL is in Alabama, which is south of Texas. But I need to check their exact latitudes. If Lake Martin is in Alabama, which is south of Texas, then it's possible that Lake Martin is south of Dallas, Texas. But wait, Dallas is in the northern part of Texas, so if Lake Martin is in Alabama, which is south of Texas, then yes, Alabama is south of Texas. But I need to confirm the exact locations.

Wait, but maybe the Dal-Tex Building is in a different part of Texas? No, I think it's definitely in Dallas. So Dallas is in north Texas. Alabama is south of Texas. So Lake Martin, AL would be south of Dallas, TX. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But I should check the coordinates to be sure.

Looking up Lake Martin, AL: The coordinates are approximately 32.5333° N, 86.2333° W. Dallas, TX is at 32.7767° N, 96.7989° W. Comparing the latitudes: Lake Martin is at 32.53° N, Dallas is at 32.77° N. So Dallas is actually slightly north of Lake Martin. Wait, but latitude increases as you go north. So 32.77 is north of 32.53. Therefore, Lake Martin is south of Dallas. So yes, Lake Martin, AL is south of the Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, TX. Therefore, the answer is yes.
