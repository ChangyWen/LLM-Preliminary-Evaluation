Okay, let's see. The user is asking if 98580, WA is located west of 97233, OR. I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should recall that ZIP codes can sometimes be a bit tricky because they don't always correspond directly to exact geographic coordinates, but they do represent specific areas. So, I need to find the approximate locations of these ZIP codes.

Starting with 98580, WA. Washington state is on the west coast of the US. I know that ZIP codes in Washington can be in various parts, but 98580... Hmm, I think that might be in the Seattle area. Let me check. Wait, I remember that 98101 is Seattle, but 98580 might be a bit further out. Maybe in the eastern part of Washington? Wait, no, the eastern part of Washington is more like Spokane, which is around 99202. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Alternatively, maybe 98580 is in the Yakima area? Or perhaps in the Tri-Cities? Wait, I need to be more precise.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the longitude of these ZIP codes. If I can find the approximate longitudes, then I can compare them. The question is whether 98580, WA is west of 97233, OR. So, if the longitude of 98580 is less than that of 97233, then it's west. Wait, no. Wait, longitude works such that lower numbers are west. Wait, no, longitude is measured in degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian. So, for example, a location with a longitude of -122 is west of a location with -121. So, if 98580 has a longitude more west (i.e., more negative) than 97233, then it's west of it.

So, I need to find the approximate longitudes of both ZIP codes.

Let me try to recall or think of approximate locations. Oregon is to the south of Washington. So, 97233, OR is in Oregon. Let me think about Oregon ZIP codes. 97233... I think that's in the Portland area. Portland's ZIP codes are around 97201, 97202, etc. So 97233 might be a bit further out, maybe in the east side of Portland or in the Gresham area. Let me check. Gresham is in Oregon, and their ZIP codes start with 970, 971, 972. So 97233 is likely in Gresham or nearby. Gresham is east of Portland, so maybe that's in the eastern part of the Portland metropolitan area.

Now, the longitude of Portland, Oregon is approximately -122.65 degrees. If 97233 is in Gresham, which is east of Portland, then its longitude would be slightly less negative, meaning more east. For example, if Portland is -122.65, then Gresham might be around -122.5 or so. Wait, but actually, moving east would decrease the longitude's negative value. So, for example, -122.5 is east of -122.65. So, if 97233 is in Gresham, its longitude is around -122.5.

Now, 98580, WA. Let me think. Washington state's major cities: Seattle is around -122.33 degrees longitude. Spokane is further east, around -117.2 degrees. Yakima is around -120.5. The Tri-Cities (Kennewick, Pasco, Richland) are around -119.3. So, 98580... Let me think. If I can't recall, maybe I can think of the ZIP code. Wait, 98580 is in Washington. Let me think of the area. Maybe it's in the eastern part of Washington? Wait, but 98580... Let me check. Wait, I think that 98580 is in the town of East Wenatchee, which is in Chelan County, Washington. East Wenatchee is in the eastern part of Washington, near the Columbia River. Let me confirm. If that's the case, then East Wenatchee's longitude would be around -120.5 degrees. Wait, but that's more west than Spokane, which is further east. Wait, no. Wait, longitude: the more negative the number, the further west. So, -122 is west of -120. So, if East Wenatchee is at -120.5, that's east of Seattle (-122.33). So, if 98580 is in East Wenatchee, then its longitude is around -120.5. Then, comparing to 97233, OR which is around -122.5. So, -120.5 is east of -122.5. Therefore, 98580, WA would be east of 97233, OR, not west. Therefore, the answer would be No.

Wait, but I need to make sure that 98580 is indeed in East Wenatchee. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the ZIP codes. Let me try to think of other areas. For example, 98580... If I search in my mind, I know that 98580 is a valid ZIP code in Washington. Let me think of the area. Maybe it's in the Yakima area? Yakima's ZIP codes start with 989... So 98580 is different. Alternatively, maybe it's in the Wenatchee area. East Wenatchee is in Chelan County, and I think that ZIP code is 98801, but maybe 98580 is another part. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach.

Alternatively, I can think of the fact that Oregon is to the south of Washington. So, if 97233 is in Oregon, and 98580 is in Washington, then depending on their positions, they could be east or west of each other. But the key is to compare their longitudes.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the fact that the westernmost point of Washington is near the Pacific coast, while the eastern part is near the Idaho border. So, if 98580 is in eastern Washington, then it's east of the state's western parts. But Oregon is to the south, so maybe 97233 is in the western part of Oregon, near the coast. Wait, but Portland is inland. So, if 97233 is in Gresham, which is east of Portland, then it's in the eastern part of Oregon. But Washington's eastern part is east of the Cascade Mountains, while Oregon's eastern part is east of the Cascades as well. So, maybe they are in similar longitudes?

Alternatively, perhaps I should use approximate coordinates. Let me try to recall or estimate.

For 97233, OR: Gresham, Oregon. Let me think of Gresham's coordinates. Gresham is in the Portland metropolitan area. Portland's coordinates are approximately 45.5231° N, 122.6750° W. Gresham is slightly east of Portland, so maybe 45.5° N, 122.5° W. So longitude around -122.5.

For 98580, WA: If it's in East Wenatchee, which is in Chelan County, Washington. Let me think of Wenatchee's coordinates. Wenatchee is in central Washington, near the Columbia River. Coordinates for Wenatchee are approximately 47.15° N, 120.33° W. So longitude around -120.33. So, that's east of Gresham's -122.5. Therefore, 98580 (if in Wenatchee) is east of 97233 (Gresham, OR). Therefore, the answer would be No, 98580, WA is not west of 97233, OR.

But wait, I need to confirm that 98580 is indeed in Wenatchee or East Wenatchee. Let me think again. If I can't recall, maybe I can think of the ZIP code structure. Washington state ZIP codes: 98580. The first three digits are 985, which is in the central part of Washington. For example, 98501 is Wenatchee. So 98580 would be in the same area. So, yes, 98580 is in Wenatchee, Washington. Therefore, its longitude is around -120.33, which is east of Gresham, OR's -122.5. Therefore, 98580 is east of 97233, so the answer is No.
