Okay, let's see. The user is asking if The University of Tampa, FL is located north of Schiller International University, FL. I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should confirm the locations of both universities. The University of Tampa is in Tampa, Florida. I know Tampa is a city in the western part of Florida, near the Gulf of Mexico. Now, Schiller International University... Hmm, I'm not as familiar with that one. Let me think. I remember that Schiller International University has campuses in different states. Wait, I think one of their campuses is in Florida, but where exactly?

Maybe I should look up the addresses of both universities. Since I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge. The University of Tampa's main campus is in Tampa, FL. For Schiller International University, I recall that they have a campus in Sarasota, Florida. Sarasota is a city on the Gulf Coast, south of Tampa. So if Schiller is in Sarasota and the University of Tampa is in Tampa, then Tampa is north of Sarasota. That would mean the answer is yes.

Wait, but I need to be sure. Let me visualize the map. Tampa is in the central-western part of Florida, and Sarasota is to the south of Tampa. So if you go from Tampa towards the south, you reach Sarasota. Therefore, Tampa is north of Sarasota. So if Schiller International University is in Sarasota, then yes, the University of Tampa is north of it.

But wait, could Schiller International University have another campus in Florida that's not in Sarasota? I think their main campus in Florida is in Sarasota. Let me confirm. Schiller International University's Florida campus is indeed in Sarasota. So that's correct.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. The University of Tampa is located north of Schiller International University in Florida.
