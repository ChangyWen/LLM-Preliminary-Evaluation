Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Garnavillo, Iowa is located east of Newellton, Louisiana. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should probably find the coordinates of both places. Coordinates will help determine their relative positions. Let me start with Garnavillo, IA. I remember that Iowa is in the Midwestern United States, and Garnavillo is a small town there. Maybe I can look up its latitude and longitude. Let me think... I think Garnavillo is around 42 degrees north latitude and maybe 93 degrees west longitude? Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should check a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge.

Newellton, LA. Louisiana is in the southern part of the U.S. Newellton is a small town in Louisiana, probably near the Mississippi River. I think it's in the northern part of Louisiana, maybe near the border with Mississippi. Its coordinates might be around 32 degrees north latitude and 91 degrees west longitude? Again, not entirely sure, but I'll go with that for now.

Now, comparing the longitudes. If Garnavillo is at 93W and Newellton is at 91W, then Garnavillo is further west. Wait, but longitude lines go from east to west. So lower numbers (more east) are to the east. So if Newellton is at 91W, that's east of 93W. Therefore, Garnavillo would be west of Newellton. But the question is whether Garnavillo is east of Newellton. So if Garnavillo is west, then the answer would be no.

But wait, maybe I got the coordinates wrong. Let me think again. Iowa is west of Louisiana. So if both towns are in their respective states, Garnavillo in Iowa would be west of Louisiana. But Newellton is in Louisiana, which is east of Iowa. So if Garnavillo is in Iowa, which is west of Louisiana, then Garnavillo is west of Newellton. Therefore, the answer would be no, Garnavillo is not east of Newellton.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the exact positions. Let me try to recall approximate locations. Iowa is west of Missouri, which is west of Louisiana. So Louisiana is east of Iowa. Therefore, any town in Iowa would be west of towns in Louisiana. So Garnavillo, IA would be west of Newellton, LA. Hence, the answer is no.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the States:**  
   - Garnavillo, IA is in **Iowa** (Midwest, U.S.).  
   - Newellton, LA is in **Louisiana** (Southeast, U.S.).  

2. **Geographical Orientation:**  
   - **Iowa** lies **west** of **Louisiana**.  
   - Therefore, any location in Iowa (e.g., Garnavillo) is generally **west** of locations in Louisiana (e.g., Newellton).  

3. **Longitude Comparison (Approximate):**  
   - Iowa’s longitude ranges roughly from **90°W to 96°W**.  
   - Louisiana’s longitude ranges roughly from **90°W to 94°W**.  
   - Garnavillo, IA (approx. **42.1°N, 93.1°W**) is **west** of Newellton, LA (approx. **32.3°N, 91.5°W**).  

4. **Conclusion:**  
   Since Garnavillo, IA is west of Newellton, LA, it is **not** located east of Newellton, LA.  

**Final Answer:** No.
