Okay, let's try to figure out if the Red Balloon Learning Center in Manhattan is located east of Hunters Point S Park Playground in Queens. Hmm, first, I need to confirm the locations of both places.

Starting with the Red Balloon Learning Center. I know that Manhattan is one of the five boroughs of New York City, and Queens is another. So, the first thing is to check if the Red Balloon Learning Center is indeed in Manhattan. Maybe I can search for their address. Let me think... I recall that there's a Red Balloon Learning Center in Manhattan, but I'm not sure of the exact address. Let me try to remember or think of any references. Alternatively, maybe I can think of their website or other sources. Wait, I think they have a location at 123 West 45th Street, Manhattan. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's in another part of Manhattan.

Now, Hunters Point S Park Playground is in Queens. Hunters Point is a neighborhood in Long Island City, Queens. So, the playground is in Queens. Now, the question is whether the Manhattan location is east of that Queens playground. But wait, Manhattan and Queens are two different boroughs separated by the East River. Manhattan is to the north of the East River, and Queens is to the east of the East River. So, if the Red Balloon is in Manhattan, and the playground is in Queens, then the direction between them would depend on their exact positions.

But the question is whether Manhattan's Red Balloon is east of the Queens playground. However, since Manhattan is west of Queens across the East River, the Red Balloon in Manhattan would be west of the Hunters Point playground in Queens. Wait, but maybe the exact positions matter. For example, if the Red Balloon is in the eastern part of Manhattan, like near the East River, and the playground is in Queens, then maybe the Red Balloon is east of the playground? But that seems unlikely because Queens is east of Manhattan. So, if you're in Manhattan, east would be towards the East River, but Queens is across the river. So, the Red Balloon in Manhattan would be west of the playground in Queens. Therefore, the answer would be No.

But I need to confirm the exact locations. Let me try to think of the coordinates. Hunters Point S Park Playground is in Long Island City, Queens. Let's say its coordinates are approximately 40.7355째 N, 73.8655째 W. Now, if the Red Balloon Learning Center is in Manhattan, say at 40.7589째 N, 73.9853째 W (which is near the East River in Manhattan), then Manhattan is west of Queens. So, the Red Balloon would be west of the playground. Therefore, the answer is No.

Alternatively, if the Red Balloon is in a different part of Manhattan, like the east side of Manhattan, but even then, Queens is east of Manhattan. So, regardless of where in Manhattan the Red Balloon is, it's still west of Queens. Therefore, the answer is No.
