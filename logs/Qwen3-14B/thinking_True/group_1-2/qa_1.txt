Okay, so I need to figure out if Mo Hayder's "Birdman" is shorter than Peter Hitchens's "The Abolition of Britain." Let me start by recalling what I know about these books. 

First, I should check the page counts of both books. If I can find the number of pages for each, I can compare them directly. But I don't remember the exact page numbers off the top of my head. Maybe I can look them up. Wait, but since I can't actually browse the internet, I need to rely on my existing knowledge or any information I might have come across before.

Mo Hayder is a British author known for her crime fiction. "Birdman" is one of her novels, part of the Detective Inspector Rachel Markham series. I think it's a standalone book, but I'm not sure. Peter Hitchens is a journalist and author, and "The Abolition of Britain" is a political commentary book. It's likely a non-fiction work, which might be longer than a fiction novel, but I can't be certain.

I remember that crime novels can vary in length. Some are around 300-400 pages, while others might be longer. Non-fiction books, especially those that are in-depth analyses, can be quite lengthy, sometimes over 500 pages. However, I need to be careful here. Maybe "The Abolition of Britain" is a shorter non-fiction book. Alternatively, "Birdman" might be a longer novel. 

Wait, I think I've heard that "Birdman" is around 300 pages. Let me think. If I recall correctly, some of Hayder's books are in the 300-350 page range. On the other hand, Peter Hitchens's books might be longer. For example, his other works like "The Trail of the New White Man" are around 300 pages, but "The Abolition of Britain" might be similar or a bit longer. However, I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the publication dates. "Birdman" was published in 2004, and "The Abolition of Britain" came out in 2010. But that doesn't directly relate to page count. 

Another approach: check the ISBN or edition details. But again, without access to that information, I need to rely on estimates. 

Wait, I think I remember that "The Abolition of Britain" is around 320 pages. If "Birdman" is 300 pages, then yes, it's shorter. But if "Birdman" is 350 pages, then no. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of other books by these authors. For example, Mo Hayder's "The Cutting" is around 320 pages. "Birdman" might be similar. Peter Hitchens's "The Abolition of Britain" is a non-fiction book, and non-fiction can vary. Some are concise, others are lengthy. 

I think I need to make an educated guess here. If I can't find exact numbers, I might have to go with the most common page counts for similar books. If "Birdman" is a typical crime novel and "The Abolition of Britain" is a typical non-fiction political book, then maybe the non-fiction is longer. But I'm not 100% sure. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the average page count for each genre. Crime novels often range from 250 to 400 pages, while non-fiction can be similar or longer. However, some non-fiction books are shorter. 

Given that I can't find exact numbers, I might have to say that without specific page counts, it's hard to be certain. But based on general knowledge, I think "Birdman" is likely shorter than "The Abolition of Britain." However, I'm not entirely sure. Wait, but I should check if there's any other way. 

Wait, maybe I can think of the authors' writing styles. Mo Hayder's books are known for being fast-paced and concise, while Peter Hitchens might write more detailed analyses. That could mean "The Abolition of Britain" is longer. 

But again, this is speculative. If I had to answer based on the best of my knowledge, I would say that "Birdman" is shorter. However, I need to be cautious. If I'm wrong about the page counts, the answer could be incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the number of chapters or sections. But that's not directly helpful. 

In conclusion, based on my current knowledge and estimates, I think "Birdman" is shorter than "The Abolition of Britain." But I'm not 100% certain without checking the exact page numbers.
