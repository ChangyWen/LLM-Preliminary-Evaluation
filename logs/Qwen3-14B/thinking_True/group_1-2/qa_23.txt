Okay, let's try to figure out if St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church in Nevada is located east of Pine Flat Dam in California. Hmm, first, I need to find out where both of these places are located.

Starting with St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV. The name "Mountains" might suggest it's in a mountainous area. Nevada is a state that has several mountain ranges, like the Sierra Nevada, but wait, the Sierra Nevada is actually in California. Maybe it's in the eastern part of Nevada, near the Great Basin? Or perhaps it's in a different region. I should check the exact location of this church. Maybe I can search for "St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church Nevada" to get its coordinates or a map location.

Then, Pine Flat Dam is in California. I remember that Pine Flat Dam is part of the Pine Flat Lake reservoir, which is in the Sierra Nevada region. It's located in Fresno County, California. So, the dam is in the central part of California, near the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Now, if St. Mary’s is in Nevada, and Pine Flat Dam is in California, the question is whether Nevada is east of California. Wait, Nevada is west of California, right? California is on the west coast, and Nevada is to the east of California. So, if the church is in Nevada, it's east of California. But the question is whether the church is east of Pine Flat Dam specifically. So, if Pine Flat Dam is in California, and the church is in Nevada, then Nevada is east of California, so the church would be east of the dam. But I need to confirm the exact locations.

Wait, but maybe the church is in a part of Nevada that's west of Pine Flat Dam? For example, if the church is in western Nevada, near the California border, but Pine Flat Dam is in central California. So, Nevada is east of California, but the church's exact location might be west of the dam. Wait, no. If the dam is in California, and the church is in Nevada, then Nevada is east of California. So regardless of where in Nevada the church is, it's east of California. Therefore, the church would be east of Pine Flat Dam. But I need to make sure that the church is indeed in Nevada and not in California. The user specified "St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV", so the NV stands for Nevada. So the church is in Nevada.

Therefore, since Nevada is east of California, and Pine Flat Dam is in California, the church in Nevada would be east of the dam. So the answer would be Yes. But wait, maybe there's a specific location in Nevada that's west of Pine Flat Dam? Let me think. Pine Flat Dam is in the Sierra Nevada, which is in central California. Nevada is to the east of California. So the entire state of Nevada is east of California. Therefore, any location in Nevada would be east of any location in California. Therefore, the church in Nevada is east of Pine Flat Dam in California. So the answer is Yes.

But I should double-check if there's a possibility that the church is in a part of Nevada that's west of the dam. For example, if the dam is in central California, and the church is in western Nevada, which is near the California border. But even then, Nevada is east of California. So even if the church is near the California border, it's still east of the dam. Because the dam is in California, which is west of Nevada. So regardless of where in Nevada the church is, it's east of the dam. Therefore, the answer is Yes.
