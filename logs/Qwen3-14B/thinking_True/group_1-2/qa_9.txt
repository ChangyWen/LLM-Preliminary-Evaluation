Okay, let's try to figure out whether William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey died later than Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy. Hmm, I need to find out the dates of their deaths. 

First, I should start with William de Warenne. I remember that he was a significant figure in the 12th century. Let me think... He was a Norman nobleman, right? I think he was involved in the Crusades. Wait, wasn't he the one who died during the Second Crusade? Or maybe that's someone else. Let me check my memory. Oh, right, William de Warenne was the 1st Earl of Surrey, and he died in 1138. Wait, no, that might be his son. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall. The 1st Earl of Surrey was William de Warenne, who was born around 1035. He was married to Gundrada de Warenne. I think he died in 1088. Wait, but that seems too early. Maybe I'm mixing up different earls. Let me think again. The 1st Earl of Surrey was actually William de Warenne, who was born in the 11th century. He was the son of William the Conqueror's half-brother, Robert, Count of Mortain. He was granted the earldom of Surrey. I think he died in 1088, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe he died later. Wait, I need to confirm this. 

Now, Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy. She was a member of the House of Aquitaine. I think she was the wife of Amadeus III, Count of Savoy. Let me recall. Amadeus III was Count of Savoy from 1135 until his death in 1148. If Agnes was his wife, she might have died around the same time or later. But I need to check her death date. I think she died in 1152. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe she died earlier. 

Wait, let me try to get the dates straight. If William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey died in 1088, and Agnes of Aquitaine died in 1152, then yes, she died later. But if William died later, then the answer would be no. However, I'm not sure about the exact dates. Let me try to verify. 

Looking up in my mind, William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, was born around 1035 and died in 1088. He was a key figure in the Norman Conquest. His son was William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey, who died in 1138. So the first Earl died in 1088. 

Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy, was the wife of Amadeus III. Amadeus III died in 1148. If Agnes died after that, maybe in 1152, then she would have died later than William. But if she died before 1088, then no. However, since Amadeus III died in 1148, and Agnes was his wife, it's likely she died after 1088. So if she died in 1152, then yes, she died later. 

Therefore, the answer would be Yes, Agnes died later than William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey.
