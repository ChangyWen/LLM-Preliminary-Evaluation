Okay, so I need to figure out if 79104, TX is less densely populated than 83703, ID. Let me start by recalling what population density means. It's the number of people per square mile or per square kilometer. So, I need to find the population density for both ZIP codes.

First, I should check the population of each ZIP code. But wait, ZIP codes can be tricky because they might cover multiple cities or parts of cities. I need to make sure I'm looking at the correct ZIP code areas. Let me think. 79104 is in Texas. I remember that Texas has a lot of rural areas, but some ZIP codes might be in cities. 83703 is in Idaho. Idaho is a more rural state overall, but again, ZIP codes can vary.

I need to find the population for each ZIP code. Maybe I can use the U.S. Census Bureau's data. But I don't have access to that right now. Alternatively, I can use online sources like the Census Bureau's QuickFacts or other demographic databases. Wait, but since I can't actually browse the internet, I need to rely on my existing knowledge or approximate data.

Alternatively, I can think about the general population density of Texas versus Idaho. Texas is more densely populated overall, but that's the state level. However, individual ZIP codes can vary. For example, urban areas in Texas like Houston or Dallas have high densities, while rural areas have low. Similarly, Idaho's population is more spread out, but some areas might be more dense.

Wait, but the question is about specific ZIP codes. Let me try to recall if I know any specific information about these ZIP codes. 79104, TX – I think that's in the Amarillo area. Amarillo is a city in Texas, so 79104 might be part of the city. If that's the case, the population density would be higher than a rural ZIP code. On the other hand, 83703, ID – I'm not sure where that is in Idaho. Maybe it's in a rural area. Let me think. Idaho has cities like Boise, but 83703 might be in a smaller town or rural area.

Alternatively, I can think about the population per square mile for each ZIP code. If I can estimate the population and the area, I can calculate the density. But without exact numbers, this is tricky. However, maybe I can use approximate data. For example, if 79104 is in Amarillo, which has a population of around 190,000, but the ZIP code might be a part of that. Let's say 79104 has a population of, say, 10,000 people. If the area is, say, 10 square miles, the density would be 1,000 per square mile. But I don't know the actual numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the general population density of Texas versus Idaho. Texas has a population density of about 100 people per square mile, while Idaho is around 22 people per square mile. But that's state-wide. However, specific ZIP codes can be different. If 79104 is in a city, it would be higher than the state average, and 83703 might be lower. But I need to be careful here.

Wait, another approach: check if these ZIP codes are in urban or rural areas. If 79104 is in a city, and 83703 is in a rural area, then 79104 would have higher density. But the question is whether 79104 is less densely populated than 83703. So if 79104 is in a city, it's more dense, so the answer would be No. But if 79104 is rural and 83703 is more urban, then maybe Yes. But I need to figure out where these ZIP codes are.

Let me try to recall. 79104, TX – I think that's in the Amarillo area. Let me confirm. Amarillo's ZIP codes include 79104. So that's a city. 83703, ID – I'm not sure. Let me think about Idaho's ZIP codes. Boise is 83702, 83703 might be nearby. Wait, 83703 is in Boise, Idaho. Boise is a city, so 83703 would be part of the city. If that's the case, then both ZIP codes are in cities. But which one is more densely populated?

Amarillo, Texas has a population of around 190,000, and Boise, Idaho has around 220,000. But the area of the ZIP codes would matter. If 79104 is a part of Amarillo, and 83703 is a part of Boise, then we need to compare their densities. However, without exact data, it's hard. But maybe I can use approximate city densities. For example, Amarillo's population density is about 1,000 people per square mile, while Boise's might be similar or higher. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can think about the fact that Texas cities are generally more densely populated than Idaho cities. But that might not be true. For example, Boise is a city in a state with lower overall density, but the city itself might have higher density. However, without specific data, this is speculative.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the population density of Texas is higher than Idaho's. But again, that's state-wide. If both ZIP codes are in cities, their densities might be higher than the state average. But which one is higher?

Alternatively, I can think about the size of the ZIP code areas. If 79104 is a larger area with a similar population to 83703, then the density would be lower. But without knowing the exact populations and areas, I can't calculate.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look up the approximate population densities for these ZIP codes. But since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on my existing knowledge. Let me try to recall if I've heard anything about these ZIP codes. 79104, TX is in Amarillo, which is a mid-sized city. 83703, ID is in Boise, which is a larger city. Boise might have a higher population density than Amarillo. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they are similar.

Alternatively, I can think about the fact that Idaho has a lower overall population density, so even if both ZIP codes are in cities, the city in Idaho might have a lower density than the city in Texas. But again, this is not certain.

Wait, another angle: the population of the ZIP code. If 79104 has a population of, say, 10,000 and 83703 has 15,000, but 79104 is 10 square miles and 83703 is 5 square miles, then 79104 would have 1,000 per square mile and 83703 would have 3,000, making 79104 less dense. But if the populations are similar and the areas are different, that would affect the density.

But without actual numbers, I can't be sure. However, given that the user is asking this question, maybe there's a known answer. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 79104 is in a city in Texas, and 83703 is in a city in Idaho, and since Texas cities are more densely populated than Idaho cities, the answer would be No, 79104 is not less densely populated than 83703. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, maybe the opposite is true. Maybe Idaho's cities are more densely populated. I need to think. For example, Boise has a higher population density than Amarillo. Let me try to recall. Amarillo's population density is around 1,000 per square mile. Boise's might be similar or higher. If I can't be sure, maybe the answer is that I can't determine without exact data. But the user is expecting a Yes or No answer.

Wait, maybe I can check the approximate population of each ZIP code. Let me think. 79104, TX – according to some sources I remember, the population of 79104 is around 10,000. 83703, ID – maybe around 15,000. If the area of 79104 is 10 square miles, that's 1,000 per square mile. If 83703 is 5 square miles, that's 3,000 per square mile. So 79104 would be less dense. But if the areas are different, that changes things. However, without knowing the exact areas, this is guesswork.

Alternatively, maybe the areas are similar. If both ZIP codes are in cities, their areas might be similar. If 79104 has a smaller population than 83703, then it would be less dense. But again, I don't know the populations.

This is really challenging without actual data. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the cities. If Amarillo is a smaller city than Boise, and assuming similar area sizes, then Boise's ZIP code might have a higher population, leading to higher density. Therefore, 79104 would be less densely populated than 83703, so the answer would be Yes. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if the ZIP code areas are different in size, the answer could vary. But given the lack of specific data, I think the best approach is to state that without exact population and area data for these ZIP codes, it's not possible to definitively answer. However, since the user is expecting a Yes or No, I might have to go with the assumption that 79104 is in a less densely populated area than 83703, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the ZIP code 79104 in Texas is part of the city of Amarillo, which is a city with a population of around 190,000. If the ZIP code 79104 is a part of that, maybe it's a smaller portion. Let's say the population of 79104 is 10,000. The area of Amarillo is about 130 square miles. If 79104 is a small part of that, maybe 10 square miles, then density is 1,000 per square mile. For 83703 in Boise, Idaho, Boise's population is around 220,000, and the city area is about 65 square miles. If 83703 is a part of that, say 5 square miles with 15,000 people, that's 3,000 per square mile. So in this case, 79104 would be less dense. But this is all hypothetical.

Alternatively, if 79104 is more spread out, but I think cities generally have higher densities. So, given that, I think the answer is Yes, 79104, TX is less densely populated than 83703, ID. But I'm not 100% sure. However, based on the assumption that both are in cities, and Idaho's cities might have lower density than Texas cities, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the opposite. I'm really not sure. Maybe I should say that without exact data, it's not possible to determine, but the user wants a Yes or No. Given that, I'll go with the assumption that 79104 is in a less densely populated area than 83703, so the answer is Yes.
