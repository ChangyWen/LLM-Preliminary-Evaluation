Okay, let's try to figure out if Dal-Tex Building in Texas is located south of Lake Martin in Alabama. Hmm, first, I need to get the locations of both places. 

So, Dal-Tex Building, TX. I'm not exactly sure where that is. Maybe I should check if there's a Dal-Tex Building in Texas. A quick search in my mind... I think there's a Dal-Tex Building in Houston, Texas. Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. Dal-Tex might be a company or a building name. Maybe it's a specific address. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo or a different name. But assuming it's in Texas, I need to find its coordinates.

Then, Lake Martin is in Alabama. I know Lake Martin is a reservoir in the southeastern United States, specifically in the state of Alabama. It's near the cities of Alexander City and Martin, Alabama. So, the coordinates for Lake Martin would be around 32.5 degrees north latitude and 86.5 degrees west longitude, roughly. 

Now, if Dal-Tex Building is in Houston, Texas, then Houston's coordinates are approximately 29.76 degrees north latitude and 95.36 degrees west longitude. Wait, but Lake Martin is in Alabama, which is further east. So, if Houston is west of Lake Martin, then Houston would be to the west of Lake Martin. But the question is whether Dal-Tex is south of Lake Martin. 

Wait, latitude measures north-south. So, if Dal-Tex is at a lower latitude than Lake Martin, it would be south. Lake Martin is around 32.5°N. If Dal-Tex is in Houston, which is around 29.76°N, that's actually south of Lake Martin. Because 29.76 is less than 32.5. So, Houston is south of Lake Martin. Therefore, if Dal-Tex is in Houston, then yes, it's south of Lake Martin. 

But wait, I need to confirm that Dal-Tex Building is indeed in Houston. Maybe it's in another part of Texas. Let me think. If I can't recall, maybe I should consider that Dal-Tex might be a different location. Alternatively, maybe there's a Dal-Tex Building in another city in Texas. For example, maybe in Dallas? Dallas is around 32.78°N, which is actually north of Lake Martin's 32.5°N. So if Dal-Tex is in Dallas, then it would be north of Lake Martin. But if it's in Houston, then south. 

But the user didn't specify the city in Texas. So maybe I need to check if there's a Dal-Tex Building in Texas that's commonly known. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo, like Dal-Tex might be in another state. But assuming the question is correct, and it's in Texas. 

Alternatively, maybe the Dal-Tex Building is in a different location. Let me think. If I can't find specific info, maybe I should use approximate coordinates. Let's say Lake Martin is in Alabama, and if Dal-Tex is in Texas, then depending on where in Texas, it could be either north or south. But Texas is mostly south of Alabama. Wait, no. Alabama is in the southeastern US, and Texas is to the west. So, if you look at a map, Texas is west of Alabama. So, if you take a point in Texas, like Houston, it's west and south of Alabama. But Lake Martin is in central Alabama. So, if Dal-Tex is in Houston, then it's south of Lake Martin. But if it's in a northern part of Texas, like near the Texas-Oklahoma border, then it might be north of Lake Martin. 

But without knowing the exact location of Dal-Tex Building in Texas, it's hard to be certain. However, the most likely assumption is that if the user refers to Dal-Tex Building, TX, they might be referring to a well-known building. For example, the Dal-Tex Building in Houston is a historic building. If that's the case, then yes, Houston is south of Lake Martin. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different Dal-Tex. But given the information, I think the answer would be yes, assuming Dal-Tex is in Houston, Texas. Therefore, the answer is Yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Locations:**
   - **Lake Martin** is a reservoir in **Alabama**, located near Alexander City and Martin, AL. Its approximate coordinates are **32.5°N latitude**.
   - **Dal-Tex Building, TX** is assumed to be in **Houston, Texas** (a well-known building in Texas, though not explicitly confirmed in the query). Houston's coordinates are approximately **29.76°N latitude**.

2. **Compare Latitudes:**
   - Latitude measures north-south position. A lower latitude (e.g., 29.76°N) is **south** of a higher latitude (e.g., 32.5°N).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - If Dal-Tex Building is in Houston, TX (29.76°N), it is **south** of Lake Martin, AL (32.5°N).

**Final Answer:** Yes.
