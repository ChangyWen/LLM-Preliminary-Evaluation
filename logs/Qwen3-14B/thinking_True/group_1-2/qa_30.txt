Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Lake Vico is located west of Pragser Wildsee. Hmm, I need to figure out the locations of both lakes and their relative positions.

First, I should recall where these lakes are. I think Pragser Wildsee is in Austria. Wait, yes, it's in the Dolomites, part of the Alps. I remember that Pragser Wildsee is a popular hiking destination, maybe near the village of Prags or Prag? I'm not entirely sure about the exact location, but I know it's in the South Tyrol region of Italy or maybe in Austria. Wait, South Tyrol is in northern Italy, but Pragser Wildsee might be in Austria. Let me check that. Oh, actually, Pragser Wildsee is in Austria, in the state of Salzburg, near the border with Italy. It's part of the Puster Valley.

Now, Lake Vico. I'm less familiar with that one. Let me think. Vico might be in Italy. Maybe in the Dolomites as well? I recall there's a Lake Vico in the Veneto region of Italy. Let me confirm. Yes, Lake Vico is in the Veneto region, near the town of San Vito di Cadore. That's in the Dolomites, so it's in northern Italy.

So, Pragser Wildsee is in Austria, and Lake Vico is in Italy. Now, I need to determine their relative positions. If I can figure out their coordinates or their approximate locations, I can see which is west of the other.

Pragser Wildsee is in the Puster Valley, which is in the Austrian Alps. The coordinates for Pragser Wildsee are approximately 46.6333° N, 12.6167° E. Lake Vico is in the Veneto region, near San Vito di Cadore. Its coordinates are roughly 46.3333° N, 12.1667° E.

Comparing the longitudes: Pragser Wildsee is at 12.6167° E, and Lake Vico is at 12.1667° E. Since longitude increases eastward, a lower longitude means it's further west. Therefore, Lake Vico (12.1667° E) is west of Pragser Wildsee (12.6167° E). 

Wait, but I should also check the latitudes to make sure they're in the same general area. Both are around 46 degrees north, so they're in the same latitude range. So, the main difference is the longitude. Therefore, Lake Vico is indeed west of Pragser Wildsee.

But wait, I need to make sure I didn't mix up the coordinates. Let me double-check. Pragser Wildsee is in Austria, near the Italian border. If I look at a map, the Puster Valley is in the east of the Dolomites. Lake Vico is further west in the Veneto region. So yes, Lake Vico is west of Pragser Wildsee. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Locations:**
   - **Pragser Wildsee** is a lake in the **Austrian Alps**, specifically in the **Puster Valley** (Salzburg state), near the Italian border.
   - **Lake Vico** is a lake in the **Veneto region of northern Italy**, near the town of **San Vito di Cadore** in the Dolomites.

2. **Determine Coordinates:**
   - **Pragser Wildsee**: Approximate coordinates **46.6333° N, 12.6167° E**.
   - **Lake Vico**: Approximate coordinates **46.3333° N, 12.1667° E**.

3. **Compare Longitudes:**
   - Longitude measures east-west position. A **lower longitude** (e.g., 12.1667° E) indicates a **westerly position** compared to a higher longitude (e.g., 12.6167° E).
   - **Lake Vico (12.1667° E)** has a lower longitude than **Pragser Wildsee (12.6167° E)**, placing it further west.

4. **Verify Latitude Proximity:**
   - Both lakes are at similar latitudes (~46.33° N to ~46.63° N), confirming they are in the same general north-south range, making the longitude comparison valid.

**Conclusion:**  
Lake Vico is located west of Pragser Wildsee.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
