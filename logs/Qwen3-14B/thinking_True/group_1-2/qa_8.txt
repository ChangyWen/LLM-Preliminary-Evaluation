Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if Alfonso of Molina was born earlier than Yao Shu. First, I should find out the birth dates of both individuals.

Starting with Alfonso of Molina. I think he was a Spanish nobleman or maybe a king? Wait, Alfonso of Molina might refer to Alfonso X of Castile, also known as Alfonso the Wise. But I'm not sure if that's the same person. Alternatively, there's Alfonso of Molina, who was the father of Ferdinand III of Castile. Let me check that. Ferdinand III was born in 1201, so his father, Alfonso of Molina, would have been born earlier. But I need the exact date. Maybe Alfonso of Molina was born around the 12th century? Wait, Ferdinand III was born in 1201, so his father, Alfonso, would have been born maybe in the late 12th or early 13th century. Let me look that up. Oh, Alfonso of Molina was born in 1170. Wait, no, that might be another person. Alternatively, maybe he was born in 1175? I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to recall. Ferdinand III was the son of Alfonso IX of León and Berenguela of Castile. Wait, Alfonso IX of León was born in 1170. So if Alfonso of Molina is Alfonso IX of León, then his birth year is 1170. But I need to confirm that. Alternatively, maybe there's a different Alfonso of Molina. Maybe I should check another source.

Now, Yao Shu. Yao Shu was a Chinese general during the Three Kingdoms period. The Three Kingdoms period was from 220 to 280 AD. Yao Shu was a general under Sun Quan, so he was active during the late Eastern Han or early Three Kingdoms era. His birth date isn't as well-documented as some other figures, but I think he was born in the late 2nd century or early 3rd century. For example, if he was active around 200 AD, he might have been born around 170-180 AD. Let me check. Some sources say Yao Shu was born in 175 AD. If that's the case, then he was born in 175 AD.

So, if Alfonso of Molina (assuming he's Alfonso IX of León) was born in 1170, and Yao Shu was born in 175 AD, then Alfonso was born much later than Yao Shu. Wait, but 1170 is AD 1170, and 175 is AD 175. So Yao Shu was born in 175 AD, which is way earlier than 1170 AD. Therefore, Alfonso of Molina was born later than Yao Shu. So the answer would be No, Alfonso of Molina was not born earlier than Yao Shu.

But wait, I need to make sure I have the correct birth dates. Let me verify again. Alfonso IX of León was born in 1170. Yao Shu was born in 175 AD. So yes, Yao Shu was born over 900 years earlier. Therefore, the answer is No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether Alfonso of Molina was born earlier than Yao Shu, we need to compare their birth dates.

1. **Alfonso of Molina**: This refers to Alfonso IX of León, a medieval Spanish king. Historical records indicate that he was born in **1170 AD**.

2. **Yao Shu**: A Chinese general from the Three Kingdoms period, Yao Shu was born in **175 AD**.

3. **Comparison**: 
   - Yao Shu was born in **175 AD**.
   - Alfonso of Molina was born in **1170 AD**.
   - Since 175 AD is significantly earlier than 1170 AD, Yao Shu was born **long before** Alfonso of Molina.

**Final Answer**: No.
