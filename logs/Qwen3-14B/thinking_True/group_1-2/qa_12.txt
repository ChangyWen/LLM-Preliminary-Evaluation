Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if Palatka, FL is located south of Flagler Estates, FL. Hmm, first, I should probably get the approximate locations of both places. I know that Florida is a state in the southeastern United States, and cities there can be spread out in different directions.

I remember that Flagler County is in northeastern Florida, near the coast. Wait, Flagler Estates is a city in Flagler County. So Flagler Estates is probably near the coast, maybe near the Atlantic Ocean. Now, Palatka is another city in Florida. I think Palatka is in the northern part of the state, maybe in the area around the St. Johns River. Wait, but I'm not sure exactly where. Let me think. The St. Johns River flows through central Florida, and Palatka is known as the "City on the River." So maybe it's in the central or northern part of the state.

Now, to determine if Palatka is south of Flagler Estates, I need to compare their latitudes. If Palatka has a lower latitude (since latitude increases as you go north), then it would be south of Flagler Estates. Alternatively, if Flagler Estates is further north, then Palatka would be south of it.

Wait, but I need to check their exact locations. Let me recall or think of major cities. Jacksonville is in the northeast, near the coast. Flagler Estates is in Flagler County, which is north of Jacksonville. So Flagler Estates is probably in the northern part of Florida. Palatka, on the other hand, is in the central part. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the St. Johns River. The river flows from the north to the south, passing through areas like Palatka, then going down to the Atlantic. So Palatka is upstream, which would be more north? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the St. Johns River starts in the northern part of the state and flows south to the Atlantic. So Palatka, being on the St. Johns River, is in the northern part of the river's course. So if the river flows south, then Palatka is north of where the river meets the ocean. But Flagler Estates is in Flagler County, which is on the coast, so maybe near the mouth of the St. Johns River. Wait, the St. Johns River flows into the Atlantic near Jacksonville, but Flagler County is a bit north of Jacksonville. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, I can think of the approximate coordinates. Let me try to recall or estimate. Flagler Estates is in Flagler County, which is in the northeastern part of Florida. Its coordinates might be around 29.5 degrees north latitude. Palatka is in Putnam County, which is further inland. If I remember correctly, Palatka is around 29.7 degrees north latitude. Wait, but that would mean Palatka is slightly north of Flagler Estates. But that would mean Palatka is not south of Flagler Estates. But I'm not sure if my coordinates are correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of major cities. For example, Daytona Beach is further south than Flagler Estates. Wait, Flagler Estates is north of Daytona Beach. So if Palatka is in central Florida, maybe it's south of Flagler Estates. Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of a map. If I imagine Florida, the northern part is around Gainesville, which is in Alachua County. Palatka is south of Gainesville, but north of Jacksonville? Wait, no. Wait, Gainesville is in central Florida, and Palatka is in the northern part of the state, but south of Jacksonville? Or is it north?

Wait, I think I need to get the approximate locations. Let me think of the St. Johns River again. The river flows from the north to the south. Palatka is on the St. Johns River, and it's known as the "City on the River." The river flows through Palatka and then continues south towards Jacksonville and the Atlantic. So if the river flows south, then Palatka is north of where the river meets the ocean. But Flagler Estates is in Flagler County, which is on the coast, so maybe near the mouth of the river. Therefore, Palatka would be north of Flagler Estates. Wait, but that would mean Palatka is north, not south. So the answer would be No, Palatka is not south of Flagler Estates, but north.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check approximate coordinates. Let me try to recall. Flagler Estates, FL is in Flagler County. Let me think of the latitude. For example, Jacksonville is around 30.3 degrees north. Flagler Estates is a bit north of Jacksonville? Or south? Wait, Flagler County is north of Jacksonville. So if Jacksonville is around 30.3, then Flagler Estates might be around 29.8 or something. Palatka is in Putnam County. Let me think of the latitude of Palatka. If I recall, Palatka is around 29.7 degrees north. So if Flagler Estates is around 29.8, then Palatka is slightly south. Wait, that would mean Palatka is south of Flagler Estates. But I'm not sure if my numbers are correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the distance. If I drive from Palatka to Flagler Estates, which direction would I go? If I go south, then Palatka is north of Flagler Estates. If I go north, then the opposite. But I don't know the exact direction. Alternatively, I can think of other cities. For example, Daytona Beach is south of Flagler Estates. So if Palatka is north of Daytona Beach, then it's possible that Palatka is north of Flagler Estates. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I need to get the approximate coordinates. Let me try to recall. Flagler Estates, FL is located in Flagler County, which is in the northeastern part of Florida. Its coordinates are approximately 29.5 degrees north latitude and 81.4 degrees west longitude. Palatka, FL is in Putnam County, central Florida. Its coordinates are approximately 29.7 degrees north latitude and 81.7 degrees west longitude. Wait, so if Palatka is at 29.7 and Flagler Estates is at 29.5, then Palatka is north of Flagler Estates. Because higher latitude means more north. So 29.7 is north of 29.5. Therefore, Palatka is north of Flagler Estates, so the answer would be No, Palatka is not south of Flagler Estates.

But I'm not 100% sure about the exact coordinates. Maybe I should check another way. Let me think of the distance between them. If I go from Palatka to Flagler Estates, which direction is it? If I go south, then Palatka is north. If I go north, then it's south. But without a map, it's hard. Alternatively, I can think of the St. Johns River. If Palatka is on the river, and the river flows south towards the Atlantic, then Flagler Estates is near the coast, so south of Palatka. Wait, that would mean Palatka is north of Flagler Estates. So the answer would be No, Palatka is not south of Flagler Estates.

But I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to think of another approach. If I look up the approximate locations, but since I can't actually look it up, I have to rely on memory. I think Flagler Estates is in the northern part of Florida, near the coast, and Palatka is further inland, but still in the northern part. However, if Palatka is on the St. Johns River, which flows south, then Palatka is north of where the river meets the ocean. If Flagler Estates is near the coast, then it's south of Palatka. Therefore, Palatka is north of Flagler Estates, so the answer is No.
