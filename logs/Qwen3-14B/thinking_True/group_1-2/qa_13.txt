Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Newellton, Louisiana is located east of Garnavillo, Iowa. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should probably find the coordinates of both places. Coordinates will tell me their exact positions on the map, so I can compare their longitudes. If Newellton has a higher longitude than Garnavillo, then it's east of it, right? Because longitude increases as you go east.

So, I need to look up the latitude and longitude for Newellton, LA. Let me think. I can use a map service or a geographical database. Let me recall... Newellton is a small town in Louisiana. I think it's in the central part of the state. Maybe around the same latitude as Baton Rouge? Not sure. For longitude, Louisiana is west of the Mississippi River, so maybe around 91 degrees west or something like that.

Now, Garnavillo, Iowa. Iowa is in the Midwest. Garnavillo is a small town in Iowa. I think it's in the eastern part of the state, maybe near the Mississippi River. Iowa's longitudes are generally around 90 to 95 degrees west. If Garnavillo is near the Mississippi, which is around 90 degrees west, then maybe its longitude is around 90.5 or so.

Wait, but I need exact numbers. Let me try to remember or think of approximate coordinates. Alternatively, I can think of major cities. For example, New Orleans, LA is at about 30°N, 90°W. If Newellton is north of New Orleans, maybe around 32°N, 91°W? Not sure. Garnavillo, Iowa... Cedar Rapids is in Iowa, which is around 41°N, 91.8°W. If Garnavillo is east of Cedar Rapids, maybe it's a bit east, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's west of the Mississippi. Wait, the Mississippi River runs through Iowa, so towns on the east side of the river would be in Iowa, and west would be in Missouri. So Garnavillo is on the east side, so maybe its longitude is around 90.5°W?

Wait, but I need to be precise. Let me think of another approach. If I can't remember exact coordinates, maybe I can use relative positions. Louisiana is to the south of Iowa. But east-west? Let me think about the states. Louisiana is west of Mississippi River, and Iowa is east of the Mississippi. Wait, no. The Mississippi River forms part of the eastern border of Louisiana. So Louisiana is west of the Mississippi, and Iowa is east of the Mississippi. So if Garnavillo is in Iowa, which is east of the Mississippi, and Newellton is in Louisiana, which is west of the Mississippi, then Newellton is west of the Mississippi, and Garnavillo is east. Therefore, Newellton would be west of Garnavillo, not east. So the answer would be No.

Wait, but that's assuming that the Mississippi River is a straight line, which it's not, but generally, the river flows from north to south. So if Garnavillo is in Iowa, east of the Mississippi, and Newellton is in Louisiana, west of the Mississippi, then Newellton is west of the river, and Garnavillo is east. Therefore, Newellton is west of Garnavillo, so the answer is No.

But maybe I should check if there's any other factor. For example, maybe the towns are on the same side of the river? But I think Louisiana is west of the Mississippi, and Iowa is east. So if Garnavillo is in Iowa, it's east of the river, and Newellton is west. Therefore, Newellton is west of Garnavillo. Hence, the answer is No.
