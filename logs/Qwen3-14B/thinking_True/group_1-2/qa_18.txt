Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if Cattaraugus County, New York is located west of Cambria County, Pennsylvania. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure where these counties are, so I should probably start by recalling their locations or maybe looking up their approximate positions.

First, I know that New York and Pennsylvania are both states in the northeastern United States. Cattaraugus County is in New York. I think it's in the western part of New York, maybe near the Pennsylvania border. Wait, I remember that the city of Buffalo is in Erie County, New York, which is to the east of Cattaraugus. So maybe Cattaraugus is further west?

Now, Cambria County is in Pennsylvania. I think it's in the central or western part of Pennsylvania. Maybe near the Ohio River? Or perhaps it's in the area around Johnstown? I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Pennsylvania has counties like Allegheny, which is near Pittsburgh, and then moving west, there's Cambria. So Cambria County might be west of Pittsburgh, maybe in the central part of the state.

To determine if Cattaraugus is west of Cambria, I need to compare their longitudes. If Cattaraugus has a higher longitude (more west), then yes. But I don't remember the exact coordinates. Alternatively, I can think about major cities or landmarks. For example, if I can find a city in Cattaraugus County and a city in Cambria County and see their relative positions.

Cattaraugus County's seat is Little Valley, but I think the larger city nearby is Olean. Olean, New York. Then, Cambria County's seat is Johnstown, Pennsylvania. So, where are Olean and Johnstown located?

I know that Johnstown is in central Pennsylvania, maybe near the Allegheny Mountains. Olean is in western New York, near the Pennsylvania border. If I imagine a map, New York's western part borders Pennsylvania. So, if Olean is in western New York, and Johnstown is in central Pennsylvania, then Olean would be to the west of Johnstown? Wait, but Pennsylvania is to the south of New York. So maybe Olean is north of Johnstown, but how about east-west?

Alternatively, I can think of the state lines. The Pennsylvania and New York border runs along the southern part of New York. So, Cattaraugus County is in western New York, which is adjacent to Pennsylvania. Cambria County is in western Pennsylvania. So, if I imagine the two states, New York is to the north of Pennsylvania. So, Cattaraugus County is in the western part of New York, which is north of Pennsylvania. Cambria County is in western Pennsylvania. So, if I draw a line from west to east, Cattaraugus would be north of Cambria, but how about east-west?

Wait, maybe I should think about the longitude. Let me try to recall approximate longitudes. For example, New York City is around 74° W longitude. As you go west in New York, the longitude increases (since longitude decreases as you go east). So, Buffalo is around 78.8° W. Olean, being further west, might be around 79° W or so. Now, Pennsylvania's western part, like Cambria County, would be east of New York's western counties. Wait, no. If New York is to the north of Pennsylvania, then moving west in New York would be towards the Pennsylvania border. So, if Cattaraugus County is in western New York, it's adjacent to Pennsylvania. So, Cambria County is in western Pennsylvania, which is south of Cattaraugus. So, in terms of east-west, if Cattaraugus is west of the New York-Pennsylvania border, and Cambria is west of Pennsylvania's eastern part, then maybe Cattaraugus is west of Cambria?

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think of a reference point. For example, the city of Erie, Pennsylvania is on the eastern end of Lake Erie, and it's in Erie County, which is to the west of Pennsylvania. Wait, no, Erie County is in western Pennsylvania. Then, moving east from Erie County, you get to Cambria County? Or is Cambria further west?

Alternatively, I can think of the Susquehanna River. The Susquehanna flows through Pennsylvania, and maybe Cambria County is near that. But I'm not sure. Another approach: using a map. Since I can't look it up, I need to rely on memory.

I think that Cattaraugus County is in the western part of New York, near the Pennsylvania border, and Cambria County is in the central-western part of Pennsylvania. So, if you imagine a map, Cattaraugus is north of Pennsylvania, and Cambria is in the middle of Pennsylvania. So, in terms of east-west, if Cattaraugus is west of the New York-Pennsylvania border, and Cambria is further east in Pennsylvania, then Cattaraugus would be west of Cambria. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, another way: if I consider the longitude of Olean, New York (Cattaraugus County) and Johnstown, Pennsylvania (Cambria County). If Olean is west of Johnstown, then yes. Let me try to recall approximate longitudes. Olean, NY is around 79.1° W. Johnstown, PA is around 78.3° W. Wait, that would mean that Olean is west of Johnstown. Because lower numbers are more east. So 78.3 is east of 79.1. Therefore, Olean is west of Johnstown. Therefore, Cattaraugus County (containing Olean) is west of Cambria County (containing Johnstown). So the answer would be Yes.

But I need to confirm if my longitude estimates are correct. If Olean is at 79.1° W and Johnstown is at 78.3° W, then yes, Olean is further west. But I'm not 100% sure about the exact coordinates. Alternatively, if I think of the cities: Olean is in western New York, near the Pennsylvania border. Johnstown is in central Pennsylvania. So, if you go from Johnstown westward, you'd cross into New York, which would be Cattaraugus County. Therefore, Cattaraugus is west of Cambria. So the answer is Yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Locations:**
   - **Cattaraugus County, NY** is in western New York, bordering Pennsylvania.
   - **Cambria County, PA** is in central-western Pennsylvania.

2. **Geographic Context:**
   - New York State lies to the north of Pennsylvania.
   - Cattaraugus County is near the New York-Pennsylvania border, specifically in the western part of New York.
   - Cambria County is located in the central-western part of Pennsylvania, south of the New York border.

3. **Longitude Comparison:**
   - **Olean, NY** (a major city in Cattaraugus County) is approximately at **79.1° W** longitude.
   - **Johnstown, PA** (the seat of Cambria County) is approximately at **78.3° W** longitude.
   - Since **79.1° W** is further west than **78.3° W**, Olean (and thus Cattaraugus County) is west of Johnstown (and Cambria County).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Cattaraugus County, NY is west of Cambria County, PA based on their relative longitudes and geographic positions.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
