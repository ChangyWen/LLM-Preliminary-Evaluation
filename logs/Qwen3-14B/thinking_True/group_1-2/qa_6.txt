Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the article titled "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained" was published earlier than "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal." I need to figure out the publication dates of both articles to compare them.

First, I should check if these articles are from the same source or different ones. The titles sound like they could be from a news outlet like The New York Times or The Washington Post. Let me think. The first article mentions an activist in Moscow, which might be a Russian-related story. The second one talks about a deficit deal and recess, which sounds more like a U.S. political or economic issue, possibly related to Congress or the federal budget.

I don't remember the exact dates off the top of my head, so maybe I can think about the context. The Moscow activist article might be from a time when there were protests or political movements in Russia. The deficit deal article could be from a period when the U.S. government was dealing with budget negotiations, maybe around a fiscal cliff situation or a government shutdown. 

Wait, the "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal" title sounds familiar. I think that was an article from around 2011 or 2012 when the U.S. was facing a budget deficit and potential government shutdown. The Moscow activist article might be from a different time. For example, if the activist was running for mayor in Moscow, maybe around 2013 or later. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe both articles are from the same time period but different topics. However, without specific dates, it's hard to tell. Since the user is asking for a comparison, I need to find a way to determine which one came first. 

Another approach: check if there are any notable events that could anchor the dates. The Moscow mayor election might have been in 2013 when Sergei Sobyanin was re-elected. If the activist was running against him, that could be around that time. The deficit deal article, if it's about the U.S. budget, might be from 2011 when the debt ceiling was a big issue. 

So if the Moscow article is from 2013 and the deficit one from 2011, then the answer would be No, the Moscow article wasn't published earlier. But if the Moscow article was from 2010, then it would be earlier. However, I don't have exact dates here. 

Wait, maybe I can think of the sources. If both are from The New York Times, I can check their archives. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my memory. 

Alternatively, the titles might be from different years. The "Clock Is Ticking" article might be from a more recent year, but I'm not certain. Without specific dates, it's challenging. However, the user is expecting a Yes or No answer based on my knowledge. 

Given that the Moscow activist article is likely from a later period (say 2013) and the deficit deal from 2011, the answer would be No. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the deficit article is from 2012 and the Moscow one from 2011, then Yes. 

Hmm. I think the deficit deal article is more likely from 2011, and the Moscow one from 2013. Therefore, the answer is No.

   - If the Moscow article was published in 2013 and the deficit article in 2011, the Moscow article was **not** earlier.

**Final Answer:** No.
