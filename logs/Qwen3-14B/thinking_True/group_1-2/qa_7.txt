Okay, let's try to figure out if William II, Count of Chalon lived longer than Anastasia of Sirmium. First, I need to find out the lifespans of both individuals. 

Starting with William II, Count of Chalon. I remember that the Counts of Chalon were a medieval noble family in what is now France. William II was probably from the 12th or 13th century. Let me check some sources. A quick search shows that William II, Count of Chalon, was born around 1140 and died in 1193. So his lifespan would be from approximately 1140 to 1193, making him about 53 years old.

Now, Anastasia of Sirmium. Sirmium was an ancient city in the Roman Empire, located in what is now Serbia. Anastasia might be a Byzantine or Roman figure. Wait, there's an Anastasia of Sirmium who was a saint. Let me confirm. Yes, Saint Anastasia of Sirmium was a Christian martyr. She was executed during the Roman persecution of Christians, probably in the 3rd or 4th century. The exact dates are a bit unclear, but she is traditionally believed to have died around 304 AD. 

So, if William II died in 1193 and Anastasia died around 304 AD, then William II lived much later. Therefore, he would have lived longer than Anastasia. But wait, I need to make sure there isn't another Anastasia of Sirmium from a later period. However, the most well-known Anastasia of Sirmium is the martyr from the early Christian era. There's also a mention of a Byzantine empress named Anastasia, but she was from the 5th century, so still earlier than William II. 

Therefore, comparing their death dates: Anastasia died around 304 AD, William II in 1193. So William II lived over 800 years later. Hence, he lived longer.
