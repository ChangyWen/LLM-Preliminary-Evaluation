Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Schiller International University in Florida is located north of the University of Tampa, Florida. I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should confirm the locations of both universities. Schiller International University has a campus in Florida, but I'm not exactly sure where. I remember that Schiller has campuses in different states, like California and Florida. Maybe in Fort Lauderdale? Wait, I think their Florida campus is in Fort Lauderdale. Let me check that. Yes, Schiller International University's Florida campus is in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Now, the University of Tampa is in Tampa, Florida. So the question is whether Fort Lauderdale is north of Tampa. I need to recall the geography of Florida. Tampa is in the west central part of the state, near the Gulf of Mexico. Fort Lauderdale is in the southeastern part, along the coast, part of the Miami metropolitan area. Wait, but how do their latitudes compare?

Let me think about the cities. Tampa is in Hillsborough County, and Fort Lauderdale is in Broward County. If I imagine a map of Florida, Tampa is more towards the west, and Fort Lauderdale is further east and north. Wait, but is Fort Lauderdale actually north of Tampa? Let me think about the coordinates. Tampa's latitude is around 27.97° N, and Fort Lauderdale's latitude is approximately 26.15° N. Wait, that would mean Tampa is north of Fort Lauderdale. But that doesn't make sense because I thought Fort Lauderdale is more north. Maybe I have the coordinates mixed up.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Latitude increases as you go north. So if Fort Lauderdale is at a lower latitude than Tampa, that would mean it's south. Let me check approximate coordinates. Tampa is around 27.97° N, 82.46° W. Fort Lauderdale is about 26.15° N, 80.16° W. So Tampa is at a higher latitude, meaning it's further north. Therefore, Fort Lauderdale is south of Tampa. So if Schiller International University is in Fort Lauderdale, then it's south of the University of Tampa. Therefore, the answer would be No, Schiller is not north of the University of Tampa; it's south.

Wait, but I might be confusing the directions. Let me visualize Florida. The state is shaped like a rectangle with the Gulf of Mexico on the west and the Atlantic Ocean on the east. Tampa is on the west coast, near the Gulf. Fort Lauderdale is on the east coast, near the Atlantic. If you go from Tampa towards the east, you'd cross the state, and Fort Lauderdale is further east and a bit south. Wait, but latitude-wise, Tampa is north. So if you have two cities, one in the west (Tampa) and one in the east (Fort Lauderdale), but Tampa is at a higher latitude, meaning it's north. So Fort Lauderdale is south of Tampa. Therefore, Schiller International University in Fort Lauderdale is south of the University of Tampa. So the answer is No.
