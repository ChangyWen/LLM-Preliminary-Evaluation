Okay, so I need to figure out if the population of ZIP code 35473 in Alabama is less than that of ZIP code 76234 in Texas. Let me start by recalling how ZIP codes work. Each ZIP code is a five-digit number that represents a specific geographic area, usually a city or a part of a city. The population of a ZIP code can vary widely depending on the size and density of the area it covers.

First, I should check the populations of these two ZIP codes. But how do I find that information? I know that the U.S. Census Bureau provides population data, but I'm not sure if they have data down to the ZIP code level. Alternatively, there are other sources like the American Community Survey (ACS) which might have more detailed data. However, I don't have access to those databases right now. Maybe I can use some general knowledge or approximate numbers?

Wait, maybe I can think about the cities these ZIP codes belong to. Let me try to figure out which cities these ZIP codes are in. 

Starting with 35473, AL. Alabama's ZIP codes... I know that Birmingham is a major city in Alabama with a ZIP code starting with 352... but 35473 might be a different area. Let me think. Maybe it's in a smaller town. Alternatively, I can check if I remember any specific places. Alternatively, maybe I can use the first three digits. The first three digits of a ZIP code often correspond to the area. For example, 354 might be a specific region in Alabama. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can think of other ZIP codes in Alabama. For example, 35401 is in Birmingham. So 35473 might be in a different part of the state. Maybe it's a rural area or a smaller town.

Now, 76234, TX. Texas has many ZIP codes. The first three digits 762 might be in the Fort Worth area, since Fort Worth's ZIP codes start with 761, 762, etc. For example, 76207 is in Fort Worth. So 76234 might be a part of Fort Worth or a nearby suburb. Fort Worth is a large city, so its ZIP codes might have larger populations compared to smaller towns in Alabama.

But this is all speculative. I need more concrete data. Since I can't look it up right now, maybe I can use some general knowledge about population densities. Alabama is a state with a lower population density compared to Texas, which is one of the most populous states. However, individual ZIP codes can vary. For example, a ZIP code in a major city like Houston (TX) would have a much higher population than a rural ZIP code in Alabama. But 76234 is in Texas, and 35473 is in Alabama. If 76234 is in a city like Fort Worth, which is a major city, then it's likely more populous than a ZIP code in Alabama, which might be smaller or more rural.

Alternatively, maybe 35473 is in a larger city. Wait, I should check if I can recall any specific data. For example, I know that some ZIP codes in Alabama have populations in the tens of thousands. For instance, the ZIP code 35201 in Birmingham has a population of around 100,000. But 35473 might be different. If it's a smaller town, maybe it's in the thousands. On the other hand, 76234 in Texas, if it's part of Fort Worth, could have a population of 20,000 to 50,000 or more. 

But without exact numbers, this is just a guess. However, given that Texas has a much larger overall population and more urban areas, it's plausible that 76234 has a larger population than 35473. But I need to be careful. Maybe 35473 is in a larger city. Wait, I can think of another approach. Maybe using the fact that the average population of a ZIP code in Alabama is lower than in Texas. But again, this is not precise.

Alternatively, I can think of the fact that ZIP codes in larger cities tend to have higher populations. If 76234 is in Fort Worth, which is a major city, then it's likely more populous than a ZIP code in a smaller Alabama town. However, if 35473 is in a city like Montgomery or another large city in Alabama, it might be comparable. But I don't know the exact location of 35473.

Wait, maybe I can use the first three digits. Let me think. The first three digits of a ZIP code are the sectional center code. For example, 354 in Alabama might be a specific area. Let me check if I can recall any information about 35473. Alternatively, I can think of the fact that 35473 is in the state of Alabama, and 76234 is in Texas. If I can't find exact numbers, maybe I can use approximate data from the 2020 Census or recent estimates.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that the population of ZIP code 35473, AL is approximately 1,500 people, and 76234, TX is around 15,000. But these are just guesses. However, given that Texas has larger cities and more urban areas, it's more likely that 76234 is more populous. But I need to be careful not to assume without data.

Alternatively, I can think of the fact that the average population of a ZIP code in the U.S. is around 10,000. So if 35473 is below that average, and 76234 is above, then the answer would be yes. But again, this is speculative.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that 76234 is in the Fort Worth area. Let me think about Fort Worth's population. Fort Worth has a population of around 900,000. If 76234 is a part of Fort Worth, then it might have a population of 20,000 to 50,000. On the other hand, 35473 in Alabama might be a smaller town. For example, if it's a rural ZIP code, it might have a population of a few thousand. Therefore, it's likely that 35473 is less populous than 76234.

But I need to be cautious. Maybe 35473 is in a larger city. For example, if it's in Birmingham, which has a population of around 200,000, but the ZIP code might be a part of that. However, I don't know the exact location of 35473. Alternatively, I can check if I can recall any specific data. For example, I know that ZIP code 35473 is in the city of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Wait, is that correct? Tuscaloosa's ZIP codes start with 354... Maybe 35401 is Tuscaloosa. If 35473 is in Tuscaloosa, then it might be part of the university area or a suburb. Tuscaloosa has a population of around 90,000. If 35473 is a part of that, maybe it's around 10,000 to 20,000. But again, this is a guess.

Alternatively, if 76234 is in Fort Worth, and Fort Worth's population is around 900,000, then a ZIP code there might have a population of 20,000 to 50,000. If 35473 is in Tuscaloosa, maybe around 10,000. Then 35473 would be less populous than 76234. But if 35473 is in a larger city, maybe it's more. However, without exact data, this is uncertain.

Another approach: check if there are any known population figures for these ZIP codes. For example, I can recall that the population of ZIP code 76234, TX is approximately 15,000, and 35473, AL is around 1,500. If that's the case, then the answer is yes. But I need to verify if these numbers are accurate.

Alternatively, I can think of the fact that the population of ZIP code 35473, AL is 1,500 and 76234, TX is 15,000. Therefore, 35473 is less populous. However, I need to be careful because these numbers might not be accurate. For example, if 35473 is in a larger city, the population could be higher. But given that I don't have exact data, I have to rely on general knowledge and assumptions.

In conclusion, based on the assumption that 76234 is in a larger city like Fort Worth and 35473 is in a smaller town or rural area in Alabama, it's likely that 35473 is less populous than 76234. Therefore, the answer is Yes.
