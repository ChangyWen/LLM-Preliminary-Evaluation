Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether Peter R. Hunt's "Gold" was released later than Elliot Silverstein's "Nightmare Honeymoon." I need to figure out the release dates of both films and compare them.

First, I should confirm the directors and the titles. Peter R. Hunt directed "Gold," which I think is a 1972 film. Elliot Silverstein directed "Nightmare Honeymoon," which I believe is from 1967. Wait, but I need to be sure about the exact years. Let me check my memory. 

"Gold" (1972) is a film starring Peter O'Toole, right? And "Nightmare Honeymoon" (1967) is a comedy starring Doris Day and James Garner. If that's correct, then "Nightmare Honeymoon" came out in 1967, and "Gold" in 1972. So 1972 is later than 1967. Therefore, the answer would be Yes, "Gold" was released later.

But wait, I should make sure I'm not mixing up the directors. Let me double-check. Peter R. Hunt directed "Gold" (1972). Elliot Silverstein directed "Nightmare Honeymoon" (1967). Yes, that seems right. So the answer is Yes.
