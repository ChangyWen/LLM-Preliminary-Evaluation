Okay, let's try to figure out if Hunters Point S Park Playground in Queens is located east of Red Balloon Learning Center in Manhattan. Hmm, first, I need to recall the locations of these places. 

Wait, Hunters Point S Park is in Queens, right? And Red Balloon Learning Center is in Manhattan. So the question is about their relative positions. But since they are in different boroughs, I need to check their exact coordinates or at least their general areas.

I know that Manhattan is the main island, and Queens is to the east of Manhattan. But wait, Queens is actually adjacent to Manhattan on the east side. So Manhattan is west of Queens. So if something is in Queens, it's east of Manhattan. But the question is about whether Hunters Point S Park Playground (Queens) is east of Red Balloon Learning Center (Manhattan). 

But maybe the Red Balloon Learning Center is in a specific part of Manhattan. Let me think. If the Red Balloon Learning Center is in Manhattan, say in the west part of Manhattan, then Queens would be east of that. But if the Red Balloon is in the east part of Manhattan, like near the East River, then Queens might be to the east of that. Wait, but Manhattan's easternmost point is near the East River, and Queens is across the East River from Manhattan. So if the Red Balloon is in Manhattan, then Queens is east of Manhattan. Therefore, Hunters Point S Park in Queens would be east of Red Balloon Learning Center in Manhattan. 

But I should verify the exact locations. Let me try to recall or think of maps. Hunters Point S Park is in Long Island City, Queens. Long Island City is directly across the East River from Manhattan's East Side. So if the Red Balloon Learning Center is in Manhattan, say in the East Village or on the East Side, then Hunters Point S Park would be just across the river, to the east. But if the Red Balloon is in the West Village or another western part of Manhattan, then Queens is definitely east. 

But the problem is that the question doesn't specify where in Manhattan the Red Balloon Learning Center is. However, the question is phrased as "Red Balloon Learning Center, Manhattan" without more details. So maybe the answer is yes, because Queens is east of Manhattan in general. But I need to be careful here. 

Wait, but Manhattan is an island, and Queens is to the east of Manhattan. So any location in Queens would be east of any location in Manhattan. Unless the Red Balloon is in a part of Manhattan that's east of Queens, but that's not possible because Queens is adjacent to Manhattan's east side. So the answer would be yes. 

But I should check if there's any possibility that the Red Balloon Learning Center is in a part of Manhattan that's east of Hunters Point S Park. For example, if the Red Balloon is in the East River area of Manhattan, like near the United Nations, then Hunters Point S Park is across the river in Queens. But in that case, the park would be east of Manhattan's East Side. Wait, but Manhattan's East Side is the eastern part of the island. So if the Red Balloon is on the East Side of Manhattan, then Hunters Point S Park in Queens would be east of that. 

Alternatively, if the Red Balloon is in the western part of Manhattan, like near the Hudson River, then Queens is definitely east. So regardless of where in Manhattan the Red Balloon is, Queens is east of Manhattan. Therefore, the answer is yes. 

But I need to make sure that Hunters Point S Park is indeed in Queens. Yes, Hunters Point S Park is in Long Island City, Queens. So the answer should be yes.
