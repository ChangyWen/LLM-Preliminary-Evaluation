Okay, let's try to figure out if Hillman Houses in Manhattan is located south of Williamsburg, Manhattan. Hmm, first, I need to recall where these places are. I know that Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Wait, the user mentioned Manhattan for both, but maybe that's a mistake? Let me check that again.

Wait, the question says "HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan" and "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan." But I think Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn. So maybe there's a confusion here. Let me confirm that. Yes, Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, which is a different borough from Manhattan. So if the user is asking about Williamsburg in Manhattan, that might be a mistake. But maybe there's a place called Williamsburg in Manhattan? I don't think so. Let me think. Maybe the user meant Williamsburg in Brooklyn but wrote Manhattan by accident. But the question specifically says both are in Manhattan. That's confusing.

Assuming that the user might have made a mistake, but I need to answer based on the given information. So if both are in Manhattan, then I need to find their locations within Manhattan. But I don't recall a Williamsburg in Manhattan. Let me check my knowledge. Williamsburg is definitely in Brooklyn. So perhaps the user intended to ask about Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Hillman Houses in Manhattan. But the question says both are in Manhattan. That's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe there's a place called Williamsburg in Manhattan. Let me think. I don't think so. Maybe the user is confused between Williamsburg and another neighborhood. For example, there's a neighborhood called Williamsburg in Brooklyn, and in Manhattan, there's a place called Williamsburg, but I don't think that's the case. Let me try to recall. No, Williamsburg is in Brooklyn. So if the user is asking about Williamsburg in Manhattan, that's incorrect. But the question says both are in Manhattan. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the location of Williamsburg.

Assuming that the user meant Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Hillman Houses in Manhattan, then the answer would be different. But the question states both are in Manhattan. So I need to proceed with that. Let me check the locations of Hillman Houses in Manhattan. Hillman Houses is a public housing complex in Manhattan. I think it's located in the East Harlem area. Let me confirm. Yes, Hillman Houses is in East Harlem, Manhattan. Now, if Williamsburg is in Manhattan, but I don't think it is. So maybe the user is mistaken. But if we take the question at face value, assuming that Williamsburg is in Manhattan, then where is it? I don't know of a Williamsburg in Manhattan. So perhaps the answer is that Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, so the question is based on incorrect premises. But the user might have intended Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Hillman Houses in Manhattan. In that case, Hillman Houses in East Harlem is in Manhattan, and Williamsburg is in Brooklyn. So Manhattan is north of Brooklyn, so if Hillman Houses is in Manhattan and Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, then Hillman Houses would be north of Williamsburg, not south. Therefore, the answer would be No, because Hillman Houses is in Manhattan (north of Brooklyn) and Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, so Hillman Houses is north of Williamsburg, not south. But the user's question says both are in Manhattan, which is conflicting. So maybe the answer is No, but the premise is wrong. Alternatively, if the user made a mistake and meant Williamsburg, Brooklyn, then the answer is No. But if the user is correct that both are in Manhattan, then there's no Williamsburg in Manhattan, so the answer is No, because the premise is incorrect. But I need to answer based on the given information. So the user says both are in Manhattan. If Williamsburg is in Manhattan, then where is it? I don't know. But since I know that Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, the answer would be that the premise is incorrect, but the user might have intended Williamsburg, Brooklyn. So the answer would be No, Hillman Houses is not south of Williamsburg (Brooklyn), because Hillman is in Manhattan, which is north of Brooklyn. Therefore, the answer is No.
