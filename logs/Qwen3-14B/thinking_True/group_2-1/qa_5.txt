Okay, so I need to figure out if Russia is larger in area than Australia. Let me start by recalling what I know about the sizes of countries. I remember that Russia is one of the largest countries in the world, maybe even the largest. But I'm not sure about Australia's size compared to others.

First, I should check the approximate land areas. I think Russia's area is around 17 million square kilometers. Wait, but I need to be precise. Let me think. I've heard that Russia is the largest country by area, followed by Canada, then the USA, China, and then maybe Brazil or something else. But Australia is a continent as well as a country. Wait, Australia is a country, but it's also a continent. So, how big is Australia?

I think Australia's area is about 7.6 million square kilometers. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me try to remember. If Russia is around 17 million, then Australia would be significantly smaller. But maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think of other countries. For example, the United States is about 9.8 million square kilometers. So if Russia is bigger than the US, and Australia is smaller than the US, then Russia would be bigger than Australia. But I need to confirm the exact numbers.

Wait, I think the exact area of Russia is approximately 17,098,242 square kilometers. And Australia's area is about 7,692,024 square kilometers. So if that's correct, then Russia is indeed larger. But I should make sure these numbers are accurate. Sometimes countries have different measurements depending on whether they include territorial waters or not, but I think these are the standard land areas.

Another way to check is to compare them to other countries. For example, Canada is about 9.98 million square kilometers, which is larger than Australia. So if Russia is bigger than Canada, then it's definitely bigger than Australia. Also, China is about 9.6 million square kilometers, which is still bigger than Australia. So Russia being the largest, then Canada, then USA, China, and then Australia. That seems to fit.

Wait, but I should also consider if there are any sources that might have different figures. For example, sometimes the area of a country can be disputed or measured differently. But in general, the commonly accepted figures are Russia as the largest, followed by Canada, USA, China, and then Brazil, Argentina, etc. Australia is usually listed after those. So yes, Russia is larger than Australia in terms of area.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Countries:** Russia and Australia are both sovereign states, with Russia being a transcontinental country spanning Eastern Europe and Northern Asia, and Australia being a country and continent in the Southern Hemisphere.

2. **Recall Approximate Areas:**
   - **Russia:** Approximately **17.1 million square kilometers** (land area: ~17.098 million km²).
   - **Australia:** Approximately **7.7 million square kilometers** (land area: ~7.692 million km²).

3. **Compare the Figures:**
   - Russia's area (17.1 million km²) is **more than double** Australia's area (7.7 million km²).

4. **Cross-Verification with Other Countries:**
   - Russia is the **largest country** in the world by area, followed by Canada (~9.98 million km²), the United States (~9.83 million km²), and China (~9.6 million km²). Australia is significantly smaller than all of these.

5. **Conclusion:** Since Russia's area is substantially larger than Australia's, the answer is clear.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
