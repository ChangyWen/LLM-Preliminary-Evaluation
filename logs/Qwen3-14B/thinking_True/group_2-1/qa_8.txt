Okay, so I need to figure out if the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two deserts. The Sahara is in North Africa, right? And the Gobi is in Asia, spanning parts of China and Mongolia. Both are hot deserts, but I think the Sahara is more famous for extreme heat. But wait, maybe the Gobi has different conditions?

First, I should check the average temperatures of both deserts. I remember that the Sahara has some of the highest temperatures on Earth. For example, places like Death Valley in the US are known for high temps, but the Sahara might be even hotter. However, Death Valley isn't in the Sahara. Maybe the highest recorded temperatures are in the Sahara. I think the highest temperature ever recorded was in the Sahara, like in Libya or something. But I need to confirm that.

On the other hand, the Gobi Desert is a cold desert, right? Wait, no, cold desert refers to deserts with low precipitation, not necessarily cold temperatures. Wait, actually, the Gobi is a temperate desert. So it might have more extreme temperature variations. In the winter, it can get very cold, but in the summer, maybe it's hot. But how does that compare to the Sahara?

Wait, the Sahara is a hot desert, so it's consistently hot, while the Gobi might have more seasonal variation. So maybe the Sahara has higher average temperatures, especially during the day. But I need to check specific data. Let me think about average temperatures. The Sahara's average temperature is around 30°C (86°F) or higher, but I'm not sure. The Gobi's average might be lower. For example, in summer, the Gobi can get up to 40°C (104°F), but maybe the Sahara can go higher. Also, the highest temperatures in the Sahara might be higher than the Gobi's.

Another point: the Sahara is mostly sand and rock, which absorb and retain heat, leading to higher daytime temperatures. The Gobi has more rocky terrain and maybe some areas with more vegetation? Or is it more arid? Wait, the Gobi is a desert, so it's arid, but maybe it's more continental, leading to more extreme temperature swings. But during the day, when it's hot, maybe the Gobi can reach similar or higher temperatures than the Sahara?

Wait, I think the highest temperature ever recorded was in the Sahara. For example, in 1922, a temperature of 58°C (136.4°F) was recorded in Kebili, Tunisia, which is in the Sahara. That's extremely hot. In the Gobi, I don't recall such extreme temperatures. Maybe the Gobi's highest temperatures are lower. For example, in the summer, the Gobi might reach up to 45°C (113°F), but not as high as the Sahara's record.

But average temperatures might be different. The Sahara's average temperature is higher than the Gobi's. So even if the Gobi has some days that are as hot as the Sahara, the overall average might be lower. Also, the Sahara is more consistently hot, while the Gobi has colder winters. So when comparing the two deserts, the Sahara is hotter on average and has higher peak temperatures.

Wait, but I should check if the Gobi is considered a hot desert or a cold desert. Wait, the Gobi is a temperate desert, which is different from the hot deserts like the Sahara. So the Gobi has more extreme temperature variations, but the Sahara is a hot desert with high temperatures year-round. Therefore, the Sahara is hotter than the Gobi.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Deserts:**  
   - **Sahara Desert:** Located in North Africa, it is a **hot desert** known for extreme heat.  
   - **Gobi Desert:** Located in northern China and southern Mongolia, it is a **temperate desert** with significant temperature variations between seasons.  

2. **Compare Average Temperatures:**  
   - The **Sahara** has an average annual temperature of **30–35°C (86–95°F)**, with daytime highs often exceeding **40°C (104°F)**.  
   - The **Gobi** has a lower average annual temperature, typically **10–20°C (50–68°F)**, with summer highs reaching **40–45°C (104–113°F)** but colder winters (down to **-40°C (-40°F)**).  

3. **Peak Temperatures:**  
   - The **Sahara** holds the record for the **highest reliably measured temperature**: **58°C (136.4°F)** in Kebili, Tunisia (1922).  
   - The **Gobi** does not have recorded temperatures as extreme as the Sahara, with summer highs rarely exceeding **45°C (113°F)**.  

4. **Climate Type:**  
   - The **Sahara** is a **hot desert** with consistently high temperatures year-round.  
   - The **Gobi** is a **temperate desert** with **extreme diurnal and seasonal temperature swings** (hot summers, cold winters).  

5. **Conclusion:**  
   - While the Gobi can reach similar daytime highs in summer, the **Sahara has higher average temperatures** and **extreme peak temperatures** not matched by the Gobi.  

**Final Answer:** Yes.
