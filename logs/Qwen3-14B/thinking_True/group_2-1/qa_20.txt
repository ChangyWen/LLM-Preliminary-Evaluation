Okay, let's see. The question is whether the atomic number of oxygen is higher than that of carbon. Hmm, I need to recall what atomic numbers are. The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus, right? So each element has a unique atomic number.

I remember that elements are arranged in the periodic table in order of increasing atomic number. So, if I can figure out where carbon and oxygen are in the periodic table, I can compare their positions. Carbon is one of the lighter elements. Let me think... Carbon is number 6, I believe. Wait, yes, because the atomic number of carbon is 6. Then oxygen... I think oxygen is number 8. Let me confirm. The elements in the second period: lithium (3), beryllium (4), boron (5), carbon (6), nitrogen (7), oxygen (8), fluorine (9), neon (10). Yeah, that seems right. So carbon is 6, oxygen is 8. Therefore, oxygen's atomic number is higher than carbon's. So the answer should be yes. But wait, maybe I should check another way. For example, the order of elements. Carbon comes before oxygen in the periodic table. Since atomic number increases as you move to the right, and oxygen is to the right of carbon in the same period. So yes, oxygen has a higher atomic number. I think that's correct. I don't think I'm mixing up any numbers here. Carbon is 6, oxygen is 8. So yes, oxygen's atomic number is higher.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
Yes. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Atomic Number Definition:** The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in its nucleus.
2. **Periodic Table Order:** Elements are arranged in the periodic table in order of increasing atomic number.
3. **Carbon's Position:** Carbon (C) is the 6th element in the periodic table, so its atomic number is **6**.
4. **Oxygen's Position:** Oxygen (O) is the 8th element in the periodic table, so its atomic number is **8**.
5. **Comparison:** Since **8 (oxygen) > 6 (carbon)**, oxygen has a higher atomic number than carbon.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
