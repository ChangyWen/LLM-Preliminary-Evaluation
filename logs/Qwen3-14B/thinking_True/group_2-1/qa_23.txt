Okay, let's see. The question is whether the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water. Hmm, I need to recall what pH means. pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a substance is. The scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Water is neutral, right? So pure water has a pH of 7. 

Now, lemon juice. I know that lemons are acidic. Acids have a pH lower than 7. So if lemon juice is acidic, its pH should be less than 7. Therefore, compared to water's pH of 7, lemon juice would have a lower pH. Wait, but is there any chance that the water here isn't pure? Like, if the water is tap water, sometimes it can be slightly acidic or basic depending on minerals. But I think the question is comparing lemon juice to pure water. 

Let me think about the actual pH values. I remember that lemon juice has a pH around 2 to 3. That's pretty acidic. Water is 7, so yes, 2-3 is definitely lower than 7. So the answer should be yes. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any exception or something I'm missing. For example, if the lemon juice is diluted, but the question doesn't mention dilution. It's just asking about lemon juice in general. 

Another point: pH is logarithmic. Each whole number is a tenfold difference in acidity. So a pH of 2 is 10 times more acidic than pH 3, and 100 times more acidic than pH 4. But regardless, even if the exact number varies, as long as it's below 7, it's lower than water. 

I think that's solid. So the answer is yes.

Yes. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **pH Scale Basics:** The pH scale ranges from 0 (most acidic) to 14 (most basic), with 7 being neutral. 
2. **Water's pH:** Pure water has a pH of 7, which is neutral. 
3. **Lemon Juice's Acidity:** Lemon juice contains citric acid, making it acidic. Its pH typically ranges between 2 and 3, which is significantly lower than 7. 
4. **Comparison:** Since 2â€“3 (lemon juice) is less than 7 (water), the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water. 

**Final Answer:** Yes.
