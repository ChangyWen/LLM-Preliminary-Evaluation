Okay, so I need to figure out if a blue whale is heavier than an elephant. Let me start by recalling what I know about these animals. 

First, I remember that blue whales are the largest animals on Earth. But I'm not exactly sure about their weight compared to elephants. I know that elephants are also very large, especially African elephants. Maybe I should look up the average weights of both.

Wait, I think blue whales can be around 150 to 180 tons. But I'm not sure. Let me think. A ton is 2000 pounds, right? So if a blue whale is 150 tons, that's 300,000 pounds. Now, for elephants, I think an adult African elephant can weigh up to 6 or 7 tons. Let me check that. Maybe 5 to 6 tons for a large one. So if a blue whale is 150 tons, that's way more than an elephant's 5-6 tons. 

But wait, I should make sure I'm not mixing up tons with metric tons. Because sometimes in the US, they use short tons (2000 lbs) and in other places, metric tons (1000 kg). But I think when people talk about blue whales, they usually refer to metric tons. Let me confirm. A blue whale's average weight is about 150 metric tons. An African elephant is around 5 to 6 metric tons. So yes, 150 metric tons is way more than 5-6. 

But maybe I should check if there are any exceptions. Like, is there a type of elephant that's heavier? I know that the African bush elephant is the largest land animal, but even the heaviest ones are around 6-7 tons. The blue whale is definitely in the hundreds of tons. So even the smallest blue whale would be heavier than the largest elephant. 

Another way to think about it: if a blue whale is about 180 feet long, and an elephant is maybe 10-12 feet tall. But length isn't directly proportional to weight, but the size difference is massive. Also, blue whales are marine mammals, and their size is necessary for their lifestyle, like swimming and feeding on krill. 

I think I'm confident that a blue whale is much heavier than an elephant. So the answer should be yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Average Weights:**
   - **Blue Whale:** The average weight of a blue whale is approximately **150–180 metric tons** (1 metric ton = 1,000 kg).
   - **African Elephant:** The largest land animal, the African bush elephant, weighs around **5–6 metric tons**.

2. **Compare the Weights:**
   - A blue whale's weight (150–180 metric tons) is significantly greater than that of an African elephant (5–6 metric tons).

3. **Consider Exceptions:**
   - Even the heaviest African elephants (up to 7 metric tons) are far less than the smallest blue whale (150 metric tons).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The blue whale's weight is orders of magnitude greater than that of any elephant species.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
