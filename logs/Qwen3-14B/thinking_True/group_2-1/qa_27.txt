Okay, let's see. The question is whether the melting point of ice is lower than the boiling point of water. Hmm, I need to recall what those temperatures are. 

First, the melting point of ice. I remember that ice is solid water, and when it melts, it turns into liquid water. The melting point is the temperature at which a solid turns into a liquid. I think for water, the melting point is 0 degrees Celsius. Wait, isn't that right? Yeah, I've heard that 0°C is the freezing point of water, which is the same as the melting point of ice. So that's 0°C.

Now, the boiling point of water. That's when liquid water turns into vapor. I think that's 100 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure. Right, under normal conditions, like at sea level, water boils at 100°C. So comparing the two, the melting point is 0°C and the boiling point is 100°C. 

So the question is, is 0°C lower than 100°C? Well, yes, because 0 is less than 100. So the melting point of ice is lower than the boiling point of water. 

Wait, but I should make sure there's no trick here. Like, maybe under different pressures? But the question doesn't mention any specific pressure, so I think it's safe to assume standard atmospheric pressure. Also, sometimes people might confuse the melting point with the freezing point, but they are the same for water. So no, there's no confusion there. 

Another thing to check: are there any other factors? For example, impurities in the water could affect the melting or boiling points, but again, the question is about pure water, I assume. So yeah, the answer should be yes.

Yes. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Melting Point of Ice:** The melting point of ice (solid water) is **0°C** at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm). This is the temperature at which ice transitions to liquid water.
2. **Boiling Point of Water:** The boiling point of water (liquid water) is **100°C** at standard atmospheric pressure. This is the temperature at which water transitions to water vapor.
3. **Comparison:** Since **0°C < 100°C**, the melting point of ice is indeed lower than the boiling point of water.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
