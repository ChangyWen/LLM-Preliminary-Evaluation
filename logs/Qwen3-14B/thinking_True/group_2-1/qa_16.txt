Okay, let's see. The question is whether the boiling point of water is higher than the freezing point of water. Hmm, I need to recall what the boiling and freezing points of water are. 

First, I remember that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius. That's when water turns into ice. And the boiling point, I think, is 100 degrees Celsius. That's when water turns into steam. So if I compare those two numbers, 100 is definitely higher than 0. So that would mean the boiling point is higher than the freezing point. 

Wait, but maybe I should double-check. Sometimes, depending on the pressure, the boiling point can change. Like at higher altitudes, water boils at a lower temperature because the atmospheric pressure is lower. But the question doesn't mention anything about pressure, so I think it's safe to assume standard atmospheric pressure, which is 1 atmosphere. Under those conditions, the boiling point is indeed 100°C and freezing is 0°C. 

Another thing to consider: are there any other factors? For example, impurities in the water might affect the freezing or boiling points, but again, the question is about pure water, I assume. So yeah, under normal conditions, the boiling point is higher. 

So the answer should be yes. The boiling point of water is higher than its freezing point.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Standard Values:**  
   - The **freezing point** of water at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm) is **0°C**.  
   - The **boiling point** of water at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm) is **100°C**.  

2. **Compare the Two Temperatures:**  
   - **100°C (boiling point)** is numerically greater than **0°C (freezing point)**.  

3. **Consider External Factors (if applicable):**  
   - While pressure or impurities can alter these points, the question does not specify such conditions. Thus, standard values are assumed.  

4. **Conclusion:**  
   - Under standard conditions, the boiling point of water is higher than its freezing point.  

**Final Answer:** Yes.
