Okay, so I need to figure out if a peregrine falcon is faster than an eagle. Let me start by recalling what I know about these birds. I remember that peregrine falcons are known for their speed, especially when diving. I think they're called the fastest birds in the world. But I'm not sure about eagles. Are eagles also fast? Maybe not as fast as falcons?

First, I should check the top speeds of both birds. For the peregrine falcon, I think their diving speed, called a stoop, is really high. I've heard numbers like 200 mph or more. But wait, is that accurate? Maybe it's around 150-200 mph. I should verify that. Also, their speed in level flight might be lower, like 40-60 mph. But when they dive, they can reach those high speeds.

Now, eagles. I know that bald eagles and golden eagles are common types. What's their speed? I think they can fly at around 50 mph in level flight, but when diving, maybe they can go faster. But I don't think they reach the same speeds as peregrine falcons. Maybe their diving speed is around 100 mph? That's still less than the peregrine's 200 mph. 

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not confusing different species. Are there any eagles that can match or exceed the peregrine's speed? I don't think so. The peregrine is specifically adapted for high-speed dives to catch prey mid-air. Their body structure, with streamlined bodies and strong wings, allows them to dive at those incredible speeds. Eagles are more about strength and soaring, maybe not the same speed.

Another point: the peregrine's speed is often cited as the fastest in the animal kingdom. So if that's the case, then yes, they are faster than eagles. But I need to confirm the exact numbers. Let me think. The peregrine's stoop speed is estimated between 150 to 200 mph (240 to 320 km/h), while eagles' diving speeds are lower. For example, a golden eagle might dive at around 120 mph (190 km/h). So even the fastest diving eagle is slower than the peregrine.

Also, in level flight, peregrines are not as fast as eagles. But the question is about speed in general. If it's about diving speed, then yes. If it's about level flight, maybe not. But the question doesn't specify, so I think it's referring to their maximum speed, which would be during a dive. Therefore, the peregrine falcon is faster than an eagle.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Key Species:** The question compares the speed of a peregrine falcon and an eagle. Common eagle species include the bald eagle and golden eagle.

2. **Peregrine Falcon Speeds:**
   - **Diving (Stoop):** The peregrine falcon is renowned for its diving speed, reaching **150–200 mph (240–320 km/h)** during a stoop. This is the fastest speed recorded for any bird.
   - **Level Flight:** In level flight, peregrines typically fly **40–60 mph (64–97 km/h)**.

3. **Eagle Speeds:**
   - **Diving:** Eagles (e.g., golden eagles) can dive at **100–120 mph (160–190 km/h)**, which is significantly slower than the peregrine's stoop speed.
   - **Level Flight:** Eagles fly at **50–60 mph (80–97 km/h)** in level flight, which is comparable to peregrines but not faster.

4. **Context of the Question:** The query does not specify whether it refers to diving or level flight. However, the peregrine's **maximum speed (during a dive)** is universally recognized as the fastest among birds, far exceeding that of eagles.

5. **Conclusion:** Since the peregrine falcon's diving speed surpasses that of any eagle, the answer is **Yes**.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
