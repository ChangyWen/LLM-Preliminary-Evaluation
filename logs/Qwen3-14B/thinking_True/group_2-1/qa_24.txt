Okay, so the question is whether a day on Venus lasts longer than a day on Earth. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to recall what defines a day on a planet. A day is typically the time it takes for the planet to rotate once on its axis, right? So, a solar day is the time from one noon to the next, which is when the Sun is at its highest point in the sky. But sometimes people refer to a sidereal day, which is the time it takes to rotate 360 degrees relative to the distant stars. However, I think the question is probably referring to the solar day, since that's what we commonly think of as a day.

Now, Earth's solar day is 24 hours. But Venus is a different story. I remember that Venus has a very slow rotation. Wait, but I also think that Venus rotates in the opposite direction to Earth, which is called retrograde rotation. So, does that affect the length of the day?

Let me check. Venus's rotation period is longer than Earth's. Wait, but I need to be precise. The sidereal rotation period of Venus is about 243 Earth days. That's the time it takes to rotate once relative to the stars. But because Venus orbits the Sun in about 225 Earth days, the solar day on Venus is actually longer than its sidereal day. Wait, how does that work?

The formula for the solar day is 1/(1/rotation period - 1/orbital period) if the rotation is prograde (same direction as orbit), or 1/(1/rotation period + 1/orbital period) if retrograde. Since Venus has a retrograde rotation, the formula would be different. Let me think. The solar day is the time between two sunrises or sunsets. Because Venus is rotating backwards, the Sun would appear to move in the opposite direction. So, the solar day would be longer than the sidereal day.

Wait, let me get the numbers right. Venus's sidereal rotation period is 243 Earth days, but it's retrograde. Its orbital period is about 225 Earth days. So, the solar day would be calculated as follows. Since the rotation is in the opposite direction, the formula would be 1/(1/rotation period + 1/orbital period). Wait, no, maybe I need to adjust the signs. Let me recall the formula for solar day.

The solar day is the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky. For a prograde rotation, the solar day is longer than the sidereal day because the planet has to rotate a bit more to catch up with its orbital motion. For a retrograde rotation, the solar day would be shorter? Or longer?

Wait, if Venus is rotating backwards, then the direction of rotation is opposite to its orbital direction. So, imagine Venus orbiting the Sun in the same direction as Earth (counterclockwise), but rotating clockwise. So, as Venus orbits the Sun, the rotation is in the opposite direction. Therefore, the Sun would appear to move in the sky in the opposite direction. So, the solar day would be the time it takes for the Sun to go around the sky once. Since Venus is rotating backwards, the solar day would be shorter than the sidereal day? Or longer?

Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me think. The formula for the solar day (S) in terms of the sidereal day (P) and the orbital period (Y) is:

For prograde rotation: 1/S = 1/P - 1/Y

For retrograde rotation: 1/S = 1/P + 1/Y

Wait, that might be. Let me check with Earth. Earth's sidereal day is about 23 hours 56 minutes, and the solar day is 24 hours. So, using the formula for prograde rotation:

1/S = 1/P - 1/Y

But since Earth's orbital period is 365 days, 1/Y is very small. So, 1/S ≈ 1/P, which makes sense. But if we use the formula for retrograde, then 1/S = 1/P + 1/Y, which would make S smaller than P. But Venus's sidereal day is 243 days, and orbital period is 225 days. So, if we use the retrograde formula:

1/S = 1/243 + 1/225

Calculating that:

1/243 ≈ 0.004115

1/225 ≈ 0.004444

Adding them gives ≈ 0.008559

So, S ≈ 1 / 0.008559 ≈ 116.7 Earth days.

Wait, that would mean the solar day on Venus is about 116.7 Earth days. But that seems very short compared to the sidereal day. But if Venus is rotating backwards, then the solar day would be shorter than the sidereal day? That seems counterintuitive. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me look up the actual solar day on Venus. Wait, I can't look it up, but I can reason. If Venus rotates backwards, then the Sun would appear to move in the opposite direction. So, if Venus is rotating once every 243 days (retrograde), and it's orbiting the Sun every 225 days, then the solar day would be the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky. Since Venus is moving around the Sun, and rotating backwards, the Sun would appear to move in the opposite direction. So, the solar day would be the time it takes for the rotation and orbital motion to combine such that the Sun is back in the same position.

Alternatively, think of it as the time between two sunrises. If Venus is rotating backwards, then each time it orbits the Sun, the rotation would have to catch up in the opposite direction. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try with numbers.

Suppose Venus is at a certain point in its orbit. Let's say we're looking at a point on Venus's surface. The Sun is in a certain position. After some time, Venus has moved in its orbit, and also rotated. Because Venus is rotating backwards, the rotation is opposite to the orbital direction. So, the Sun's position in the sky would be moving in the opposite direction of the orbital motion. Therefore, the solar day would be the time it takes for the combination of orbital motion and rotation to bring the Sun back to the same position.

Alternatively, the formula for the solar day is:

Solar day = 1 / ( (1 / sidereal rotation period) ± (1 / orbital period) )

The sign depends on the direction. For prograde rotation, it's minus, for retrograde, it's plus. Wait, but earlier calculation gave a solar day of about 116 days, which is shorter than the sidereal day of 243 days. But that seems odd. If the solar day is shorter, that would mean that the Sun appears to go around the sky faster. But Venus is rotating backwards, so the Sun would appear to move in the opposite direction. So, if Venus is rotating once every 243 days (retrograde), and orbiting once every 225 days, then the solar day would be the time it takes for the rotation and orbital motion to combine. Let me think of it as the relative angular velocity.

The angular velocity of Venus's rotation is 360 degrees / 243 days, but since it's retrograde, it's -360/243 degrees per day. The angular velocity of Venus's orbit around the Sun is 360 degrees / 225 days. The angular velocity of the Sun as seen from Venus would be the sum of these two. Wait, no. The angular velocity of the Sun in the sky is the angular velocity of the planet's orbit minus the angular velocity of the planet's rotation. Wait, maybe I need to think about it differently.

Imagine you're on Venus. The Sun's apparent motion in the sky is due to both the rotation of Venus and its orbit around the Sun. If Venus is rotating backwards, then the rotation would cause the Sun to appear to move in the opposite direction of the orbital motion. So, the total angular velocity of the Sun in the sky would be the sum of the orbital angular velocity and the rotational angular velocity (since they are in opposite directions). Wait, if the rotation is retrograde, then the rotational angular velocity is negative relative to the orbital direction. So, the total angular velocity of the Sun in the sky would be the orbital angular velocity (which is positive, say, counterclockwise) plus the rotational angular velocity (which is negative, clockwise). So, the total angular velocity would be (orbital angular velocity) - (rotational angular velocity). Wait, this is getting too abstract.

Alternatively, using the formula for the solar day. Let me recall that for a planet with a prograde rotation, the solar day is longer than the sidereal day. For example, Earth's solar day is 24 hours, sidereal day is 23h56m. For a retrograde rotation, the solar day would be shorter than the sidereal day? Because the rotation is in the opposite direction, so the Sun would appear to move faster across the sky. Wait, if Venus is rotating backwards, then the Sun would appear to move in the opposite direction. So, if Venus is rotating once every 243 days (retrograde), and orbiting once every 225 days, then the solar day would be the time it takes for the Sun to complete a full circle in the sky. Since the rotation is retrograde, the Sun would appear to move in the opposite direction of the orbital motion. Therefore, the solar day would be the time it takes for the combination of the orbital motion and the retrograde rotation to result in the Sun returning to the same position.

Let me try to compute it. Let's denote:

Sidereal rotation period of Venus: P = 243 days (retrograde, so angular velocity ω_rot = -360/P degrees per day)

Orbital period of Venus: Y = 225 days (angular velocity ω_orb = 360/Y degrees per day)

The angular velocity of the Sun in the sky as seen from Venus is the sum of the orbital angular velocity and the rotational angular velocity. Wait, no. The apparent angular velocity of the Sun in the sky is due to the combination of the planet's rotation and its orbital motion. Wait, actually, the Sun's apparent motion is the result of the planet's rotation and the planet's orbital motion. So, the angular velocity of the Sun in the sky is the angular velocity of the planet's orbit minus the angular velocity of the planet's rotation. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, think of it as the Sun's position in the sky is determined by the planet's rotation and its orbit. If the planet is rotating, that causes the Sun to move across the sky. But the planet's orbit also causes the Sun to appear to move. So, the total angular velocity of the Sun in the sky is the sum of the angular velocity due to rotation and the angular velocity due to orbit. But since the rotation is retrograde, it's in the opposite direction of the orbit.

Let me use the formula for the solar day. The formula is:

1/S = 1/P - 1/Y for prograde rotation

But for retrograde, it's 1/S = 1/P + 1/Y

Wait, if that's the case, then plugging in the numbers:

P = 243 days (sidereal rotation period)

Y = 225 days (orbital period)

So, 1/S = 1/243 + 1/225 ≈ 0.004115 + 0.004444 ≈ 0.008559

Therefore, S ≈ 1 / 0.008559 ≈ 116.7 days.

So, the solar day on Venus is about 116.7 Earth days. That's shorter than the sidereal day of 243 days. But how does that compare to Earth's solar day of 24 hours?

Wait, the question is whether a day on Venus lasts longer than a day on Earth. If a day on Venus is 116.7 Earth days, then that's way longer than Earth's 24 hours. Wait, but 116.7 Earth days is about 116.7 * 24 hours = 2800 hours, which is way longer than 24 hours. So, yes, a day on Venus (solar day) is longer than a day on Earth.

But wait, earlier I thought that the solar day on Venus is 116.7 days, which is longer than Earth's day. But I need to confirm if that's correct. Because if the solar day is 116.7 Earth days, then yes, it's longer than Earth's 1 day. But I need to make sure that the formula is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. If Venus is rotating backwards, then the solar day would be shorter than the sidereal day? But according to the calculation, it's 116.7 days, which is shorter than the sidereal day of 243 days. But that seems counterintuitive. If the planet is rotating backwards, then the Sun would appear to move in the opposite direction. So, if Venus is rotating once every 243 days (retrograde), then the Sun would appear to move in the opposite direction. But since Venus is also orbiting the Sun every 225 days, the combination of these two motions would result in the Sun appearing to move across the sky in a certain way.

Wait, let's imagine a simpler case. Suppose Venus had no rotation (sidereal day infinite). Then, the solar day would be equal to its orbital period, 225 days. Because the Sun would appear to move around the sky once per orbit. Now, if Venus is rotating retrograde, that would add to the apparent motion of the Sun. So, if Venus is rotating once every 243 days (retrograde), then the Sun would appear to move in the opposite direction of the orbital motion. So, the total apparent motion of the Sun would be the sum of the orbital motion and the rotational motion. Since they are in opposite directions, the total angular velocity would be the sum of their magnitudes. Therefore, the solar day would be shorter than the orbital period. Wait, but in the case where there's no rotation, the solar day is equal to the orbital period. If there is a retrograde rotation, then the solar day would be shorter than the orbital period. So, if the orbital period is 225 days, and the solar day is 116.7 days, that makes sense. So, the solar day is shorter than the orbital period. Therefore, the solar day on Venus is 116.7 Earth days, which is longer than Earth's 1 day (24 hours). Therefore, the answer would be Yes.

But I need to confirm this. Another way to think about it: if Venus rotated in the same direction as it orbits (prograde), then the solar day would be longer than the sidereal day. But since it's retrograde, the solar day is shorter than the sidereal day. But the solar day is still longer than Earth's day. Because even though it's shorter than the sidereal day, the sidereal day is 243 days, which is way longer than Earth's day. So, the solar day of 116 days is still longer than Earth's 1 day.

Wait, but 116 days is 116 times longer than Earth's day. So, yes, a day on Venus (solar day) is longer than a day on Earth. Therefore, the answer is Yes.

But I should check if the solar day is indeed 116 days. Let me recall that I've heard that a day on Venus is about 117 Earth days. Yes, that's a commonly cited figure. So, that would mean that a day on Venus is longer than a day on Earth. Therefore, the answer is Yes.

Yes. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Definition of a Day:** A day on a planet is typically the **solar day**, the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky (e.g., from noon to noon).

2. **Earth's Solar Day:** Earth's solar day is **24 hours**.

3. **Venus's Rotation and Orbit:**
   - **Sidereal Rotation Period (spin on its axis):** Venus rotates once every **243 Earth days** in a **retrograde** (backward) direction.
   - **Orbital Period (around the Sun):** Venus orbits the Sun every **225 Earth days**.

4. **Solar Day Calculation for Retrograde Rotation:**
   - The formula for the solar day (S) when a planet has retrograde rotation is:  
     $$
     \frac{1}{S} = \frac{1}{P} + \frac{1}{Y}
     $$
     where $ P $ is the sidereal rotation period (243 days) and $ Y $ is the orbital period (225 days).

   - Substituting values:  
     $$
     \frac{1}{S} = \frac{1}{243} + \frac{1}{225} \approx 0.004115 + 0.004444 = 0.008559
     $$
     $$
     S \approx \frac{1}{0.008559} \approx 116.7 \text{ Earth days}.
     $$

5. **Comparison:**  
   - Venus's solar day is **~116.7 Earth days**, which is **far longer** than Earth's 24-hour day.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
