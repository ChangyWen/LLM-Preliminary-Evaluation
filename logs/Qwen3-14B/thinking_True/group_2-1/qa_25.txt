Okay, so I need to figure out if the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is less than that on Earth. Let me start by recalling what I know about gravity. I remember that the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is about 9.8 m/s². But what about the Moon?

Hmm, I think the Moon has less mass than Earth. Since gravity depends on mass, maybe that's why the Moon's gravity is weaker. But wait, how exactly does mass affect gravity? Oh right, Newton's law of universal gravitation says that the gravitational force between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between them. The formula is F = G*(M*m)/r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the larger object (like Earth or Moon), m is the mass of the smaller object (like a person), and r is the distance between their centers.

But acceleration due to gravity is the force divided by the mass of the object experiencing the force. So if we're talking about the acceleration on the surface of a celestial body, we can rearrange the formula. The acceleration g is equal to G*M/r². So for Earth, it's G*M_earth / r_earth², and for the Moon, it's G*M_moon / r_moon².

Now, I need to compare these two values. Let me check the mass and radius of the Moon compared to Earth. From what I remember, the Moon's mass is about 1/6th of Earth's mass. Wait, is that right? Or is it more like 1/81? Wait, I think the Moon's mass is approximately 7.342×10^22 kg, while Earth's mass is about 5.972×10^24 kg. Let me do the division: 7.342×10^22 divided by 5.972×10^24. That would be roughly 0.0123, so about 1.23% of Earth's mass. So that's not 1/6, but much less. So the Moon's mass is about 1.23% of Earth's.

But then the radius of the Moon is also smaller. The Moon's radius is about 1.737 kilometers, while Earth's is about 6,371 kilometers. So the Moon's radius is roughly 1/3.67 of Earth's radius. Let me calculate that ratio: 1.737 / 6371 ≈ 0.000273, so about 0.0273 times Earth's radius. Wait, that seems too small. Wait, 1.737 km is 1,737 meters, and Earth's radius is 6,371,000 meters. So dividing 1,737 by 6,371,000 gives approximately 0.000273, which is 0.0273%? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 1.737 km is 1.737 x 10^3 meters, and Earth's radius is 6.371 x 10^6 meters. So the ratio is (1.737 / 6.371) x 10^(3-6) = approx 0.273 x 10^-3 = 0.000273. So the Moon's radius is about 0.273% of Earth's radius? That seems way too small. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 1.737 km is about a third of Earth's radius? Wait, Earth's radius is about 6,371 km. So 6,371 divided by 1.737 is approximately 3,668. So the Moon's radius is about 1/3,668 of Earth's? That seems way too small. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, I think I messed up the units. Let me check again.

Wait, the Moon's radius is about 1,737 kilometers, and Earth's is about 6,371 kilometers. So the ratio is 1,737 / 6,371 ≈ 0.273. So the Moon's radius is about 27.3% of Earth's radius. Oh, right! Because 1,737 divided by 6,371 is approximately 0.273, so 27.3%. That makes more sense. So the Moon's radius is roughly a quarter of Earth's radius. So about 0.27 times Earth's radius.

So now, putting this into the formula for acceleration due to gravity. For Earth, g_earth = G*M_earth / r_earth². For the Moon, g_moon = G*M_moon / r_moon². So the ratio of g_moon to g_earth is (M_moon / M_earth) * (r_earth / r_moon)².

We have M_moon / M_earth ≈ 0.0123 (as calculated earlier). And (r_earth / r_moon)² is (1 / 0.273)² ≈ (3.663)² ≈ 13.42. So multiplying 0.0123 * 13.42 ≈ 0.1647. So that would mean the Moon's gravity is about 16.5% of Earth's. Which is roughly 1.6 m/s², since Earth's is 9.8 m/s². 9.8 * 0.165 ≈ 1.62 m/s². Which matches what I remember from previous knowledge.

So since 1.62 m/s² is less than 9.8 m/s², the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is indeed less than that on Earth. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

Wait, but let me check if I did the math correctly. Let me recalculate the ratio. M_moon / M_earth is 7.342×10^22 / 5.972×10^24 = 7.342 / 597.2 ≈ 0.0123. Correct. Then (r_earth / r_moon)² is (6371 / 1737)². Let me compute 6371 divided by 1737. Let me do that division. 1737 * 3 = 5211, 1737 * 3.6 = 1737*3 + 1737*0.6 = 5211 + 1042.2 = 6253.2. That's very close to 6371. So 3.6 + (6371 - 6253.2)/1737. The difference is 117.8. 117.8 / 1737 ≈ 0.0678. So total ratio is approximately 3.6 + 0.0678 ≈ 3.6678. So squared is (3.6678)^2. Let me compute that. 3.6^2 = 12.96. 0.0678^2 is negligible, but cross terms: (3.6 + 0.0678)^2 = 3.6² + 2*3.6*0.0678 + 0.0678² ≈ 12.96 + 0.489 + 0.0046 ≈ 13.4536. So approximately 13.45. Then multiplying by 0.0123 gives 0.0123 * 13.45 ≈ 0.165. So yes, about 16.5% of Earth's gravity. So 9.8 * 0.165 ≈ 1.62 m/s². Which is indeed less than 9.8. So the answer is Yes.

Yes. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Gravitational Acceleration Formula:**  
   The acceleration due to gravity on a celestial body is given by:  
   $$
   g = \frac{G M}{r^2}
   $$  
   where $ G $ is the gravitational constant, $ M $ is the mass of the body, and $ r $ is its radius.

2. **Compare Earth and Moon:**  
   - **Mass Ratio:** The Moon's mass ($ M_{\text{moon}} $) is approximately $ 1.23\% $ of Earth's mass ($ M_{\text{earth}} $):  
     $$
     \frac{M_{\text{moon}}}{M_{\text{earth}}} \approx 0.0123
     $$
   - **Radius Ratio:** The Moon's radius ($ r_{\text{moon}} $) is about $ 27.3\% $ of Earth's radius ($ r_{\text{earth}} $):  
     $$
     \frac{r_{\text{earth}}}{r_{\text{moon}}} \approx 3.67
     $$

3. **Calculate Gravity Ratio:**  
   The ratio of the Moon's gravity to Earth's is:  
   $$
   \frac{g_{\text{moon}}}{g_{\text{earth}}} = \left( \frac{M_{\text{moon}}}{M_{\text{earth}}} \right) \times \left( \frac{r_{\text{earth}}}{r_{\text{moon}}} \right)^2
   $$  
   Substituting values:  
   $$
   \frac{g_{\text{moon}}}{g_{\text{earth}}} \approx 0.0123 \times (3.67)^2 \approx 0.0123 \times 13.47 \approx 0.165
   $$  
   This means the Moon's gravity is about **16.5%** of Earth's.

4. **Final Comparison:**  
   Earth's gravity is $ 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 $, so the Moon's gravity is:  
   $$
   9.8 \times 0.165 \approx 1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2
   $$  
   Since $ 1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2 < 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 $, the Moon's gravity is **less** than Earth's.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
