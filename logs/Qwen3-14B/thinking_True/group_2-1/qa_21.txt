Okay, let's see. The user is asking if Japan is located east of China. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should recall the general geography of East Asia. China is a large country in East Asia, and Japan is an island nation. I remember that Japan is to the east of China, but I need to be precise.

Let me think about the positions. China's easternmost point is probably near the East China Sea, maybe around the Shanghai area or further east. Japan's main islands are the four main ones: Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. The main island, Honshu, is where Tokyo is located. So, if I imagine a map, China is on the west, and Japan is to the east of China, separated by the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan.

Wait, but I should check the exact coordinates. Let me think about the coordinates of both countries. China's capital, Beijing, is around 39.9042° N, 116.4074° E. Japan's capital, Tokyo, is approximately 35.6895° N, 139.7592° E. Comparing the longitudes, Tokyo is further east than Beijing. So, in terms of longitude, Japan is east of China. But longitude isn't the only factor. The direction also depends on the relative positions.

Another way to think about it: if you look at a map, China is to the west of Japan. So Japan is east of China. The Sea of Japan is between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, while the East China Sea is between China and Japan. So yes, Japan is east of China.

But wait, could there be any parts of Japan that are west of China? Probably not. All of Japan's islands are east of China's mainland. Even the westernmost part of Japan, like the island of Kyushu, is still east of China's eastern coast. So overall, Japan is located to the east of China.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Geographical Context:**  
   - China is a large country in East Asia, with its mainland extending from the Pacific Ocean to Central Asia.  
   - Japan is an archipelago of four main islands (Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu) located in the Pacific Ocean.  

2. **Relative Positioning:**  
   - China's eastern coast borders the **East China Sea** and the **Yellow Sea**.  
   - Japan lies to the **east of China**, separated by the **East China Sea** and the **Sea of Japan**.  

3. **Coordinate Comparison:**  
   - **Beijing (China):** ~39.9042° N, 116.4074° E.  
   - **Tokyo (Japan):** ~35.6895° N, 139.7592° E.  
   - Tokyo's longitude (139.76° E) is significantly east of Beijing's (116.41° E).  

4. **Map Visualization:**  
   - On a map, Japan is positioned to the **east** of China, with no part of Japan west of China's mainland.  

5. **Conclusion:**  
   - All of Japan's islands are located **east of China**.  

**Final Answer:** Yes.
