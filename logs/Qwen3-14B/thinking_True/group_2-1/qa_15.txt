Okay, so the question is whether the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that light and sound are both forms of waves, but they travel through different mediums. Light is an electromagnetic wave, and it doesn't need a medium to travel. It can move through a vacuum, like in space. On the other hand, sound is a mechanical wave, which requires a medium like air, water, or solids to propagate. So, in a vacuum, sound can't travel at all, right? That might be a key point here.

Now, I need to recall the actual speeds. From what I've studied before, the speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second. That's a huge number. For sound, the speed depends on the medium. In air at room temperature, I think it's around 343 meters per second. Let me check that. Yes, 343 m/s is about 1,235 kilometers per hour. But the speed of light is about 1,079,252,848.8 kilometers per hour. That's way faster. 

Wait, even if we consider sound traveling through a solid medium where it's faster, like in water or steel, it's still nowhere near the speed of light. For example, in water, sound travels at about 1,480 m/s, and in steel, it's around 5,120 m/s. But even 5,120 m/s is 5.12 kilometers per second, which is still way less than the speed of light. 

So, comparing the two, the speed of light is significantly faster than the speed of sound in any medium. Even in the best case for sound (like through a solid), it's still orders of magnitude slower than light. 

Another angle: when you see lightning and hear thunder, you see the lightning almost instantly, but the thunder takes a few seconds to reach you. That's because light travels much faster than sound. So that's a real-life example that supports the idea that light is faster.

I don't think there's any scenario where sound would be faster than light. Even in the densest materials, sound's speed is nowhere near light's. So the answer should be yes, the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Nature of Waves:**  
   - **Light** is an electromagnetic wave that travels through a vacuum at a constant speed.  
   - **Sound** is a mechanical wave that requires a medium (e.g., air, water, solids) to propagate.  

2. **Speed of Light:**  
   - In a vacuum, the speed of light is approximately **299,792 km/s** (about **1.08 billion km/h**).  

3. **Speed of Sound:**  
   - In air at 20Â°C, sound travels at **343 m/s** (~1,235 km/h).  
   - In denser media (e.g., water: ~1,480 m/s; steel: ~5,120 m/s), sound is faster but still **orders of magnitude slower** than light.  

4. **Comparison:**  
   - Even the fastest sound speed in solids (~5,120 m/s) is **~0.0017%** of the speed of light.  
   - Light travels **~300,000 km/s**, while sound in air is only **0.343 km/s**.  

5. **Real-World Example:**  
   - During a thunderstorm, lightning (light) is seen instantly, while thunder (sound) takes seconds to reach the listener, confirming light's superior speed.  

**Final Answer:** Yes.
