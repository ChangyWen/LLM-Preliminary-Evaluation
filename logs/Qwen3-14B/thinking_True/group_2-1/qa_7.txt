Okay, so I need to figure out if a cheetah is faster than a lion. Let me start by recalling what I know about these animals. Cheetahs are known for being the fastest land animals, right? I think they can run really fast, maybe around 60 to 70 miles per hour. But I'm not entirely sure. Lions, on the other hand, are big cats too, but I don't think they're as fast as cheetahs. They might be more about strength and endurance rather than speed.

Wait, I should check the exact speeds. Let me think. I remember that cheetahs have a top speed of about 60-75 mph (which is roughly 97-120 km/h). But I need to confirm that. For lions, I think their top speed is lower. Maybe around 35-45 mph (56-72 km/h)? But I'm not certain. Also, I should consider the context. Cheetahs are built for speed with their slender bodies and long legs, while lions are more muscular and built for short bursts of speed when hunting, but not as fast as cheetahs.

Another thing to consider is that cheetahs can accelerate quickly, which helps them catch prey. Lions might not have the same acceleration. Also, when they run, cheetahs can maintain their high speed for shorter distances, while lions can run at lower speeds for longer periods. But the question is about which is faster, not about endurance.

Wait, I should make sure I'm not confusing them with other big cats. For example, leopards are also fast, but I think they're slower than cheetahs. So, if cheetahs are the fastest, then yes, they are faster than lions. But I need to verify the numbers. Let me try to recall some sources. From what I've read before, cheetahs can reach up to 70 mph, while lions top out at around 50 mph. That would mean cheetahs are faster. But I should also check if there's any variation based on the source. Some sources might say slightly different numbers, but the general consensus is that cheetahs are faster.

Another point: when they're running, cheetahs use their non-retractable claws for traction, which helps them achieve higher speeds. Lions have retractable claws, which might not be as effective for speed. Also, the body structure of cheetahs is more aerodynamic, which contributes to their speed. So, putting it all together, the answer should be yes, cheetahs are faster than lions.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Key Traits:**  
   - **Cheetahs** are renowned for their speed, with a streamlined body, long legs, and non-retractable claws for traction.  
   - **Lions** are powerful predators but have a stockier build, favoring strength and endurance over pure speed.  

2. **Compare Top Speeds:**  
   - **Cheetahs** can reach **60–75 mph (97–120 km/h)** in short bursts, making them the fastest land animals.  
   - **Lions** have a top speed of **35–45 mph (56–72 km/h)**, significantly slower than cheetahs.  

3. **Consider Physiological Adaptations:**  
   - Cheetahs’ lightweight bodies and specialized muscles allow rapid acceleration and high-speed running.  
   - Lions prioritize stamina for ambush hunting, which does not require sustained high speeds.  

4. **Contextual Factors:**  
   - Cheetahs rely on speed to outrun prey, while lions use stealth and teamwork to overpower prey.  
   - No credible sources dispute that cheetahs outpace lions in short-distance sprints.  

**Final Answer:** Yes.
