Okay, let's see. The question is whether the average human lifespan is longer than that of a dog. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should recall the average lifespan of humans. From what I know, the average human lifespan varies by country and other factors, but generally, it's around 70 to 80 years. Maybe even higher in some developed countries. For example, Japan has a high life expectancy, like over 80 years. But I should check if that's accurate.

Now, for dogs. The lifespan of a dog depends on the breed. Small dogs tend to live longer than large dogs. I remember that small breeds like Chihuahuas or Pomeranians can live up to 15-20 years. On the other hand, large breeds like Great Danes or Mastiffs might only live around 8-10 years. So the average for dogs might be somewhere in the middle. Maybe around 10-15 years? But I need to confirm that.

Wait, the question is about the average human lifespan compared to that of a dog. So if the average human is, say, 75 years, and the average dog is maybe 12-14 years, then yes, humans live longer. But I need to make sure I'm not mixing up median vs average. Also, maybe the average dog lifespan is calculated considering all breeds. Let me think. If you take all dogs into account, including both small and large breeds, the average might be around 12-14 years. But I should check if that's a commonly accepted figure.

Alternatively, maybe the average is lower. For example, if a lot of dogs are large breeds, but I think in general, the average is around 12-15 years. So even if the human average is 70, that's way higher. So the answer would be yes. But I need to be precise here. Let me try to find some numbers.

Human life expectancy at birth: according to the World Health Organization, the global average is around 72 years. In high-income countries, it's higher, like 80+ years. For dogs, the average lifespan is often cited as 10-15 years, but that's a range. If we take the average of all dog breeds, maybe around 12-13 years. So even the lower end of human life expectancy is higher than the upper end of dog lifespan. Therefore, the average human lifespan is longer than that of a dog. So the answer is yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Human Lifespan:**  
   - The global average human lifespan (life expectancy at birth) is approximately **72 years** (per WHO data). In developed countries, it is often **80+ years**.  
   - This is a well-documented statistic, accounting for variations in healthcare, lifestyle, and geography.

2. **Dog Lifespan:**  
   - Dog lifespans vary by breed:  
     - **Small breeds** (e.g., Chihuahuas) live **15–20 years**.  
     - **Large breeds** (e.g., Great Danes) live **8–10 years**.  
   - The **average lifespan across all dog breeds** is typically cited as **10–15 years**, with a median around **12–13 years**.  

3. **Comparison:**  
   - Even the **lower end of human life expectancy** (72 years) far exceeds the **upper end of dog lifespan** (15 years).  
   - Thus, the average human lifespan is **significantly longer** than that of a dog.  

**Final Answer:** Yes.
