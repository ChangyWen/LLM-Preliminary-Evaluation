Okay, so I need to figure out if the wavelength of red light is longer than that of blue light. Let me start by recalling what I know about light and the electromagnetic spectrum. 

First, I remember that visible light is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which includes different types of waves like radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each of these has different wavelengths and frequencies. 

Now, within the visible spectrum, there are different colors, from red to violet. I think the order is something like red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Wait, that's the traditional ROYGBIV order. But I need to relate this to wavelength. 

I remember that the wavelength of light determines its color. Shorter wavelengths correspond to higher energy and higher frequency, while longer wavelengths have lower energy and lower frequency. So, if I can remember the order of wavelengths, I can compare red and blue. 

Wait, I think red light has a longer wavelength compared to blue. Let me think. The visible spectrum ranges from about 400 nanometers (nm) to 700 nm. Violet and blue are on the shorter wavelength end, while red is on the longer end. So blue light would be around 450-495 nm, and red is around 620-750 nm. That would mean red has a longer wavelength than blue. 

But wait, I should make sure I'm not mixing up frequency and wavelength. Since frequency and wavelength are inversely related (c = λν, where c is the speed of light, λ is wavelength, ν is frequency), if red has a longer wavelength, it must have a lower frequency. And blue, with a shorter wavelength, has a higher frequency. 

So, if I recall correctly, blue light has a higher frequency and shorter wavelength than red light. Therefore, the answer should be yes, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light. 

But let me check if I have the numbers right. For example, blue light is typically around 450-495 nm, and red is 620-750 nm. Yes, that seems correct. So the wavelength of red is longer. 

Another way to think about it is the order of the spectrum. When you see a rainbow, the colors go from red on the outside to violet on the inside. But in terms of the spectrum, red is on the longer wavelength side. So when you have a prism splitting light, red bends less than blue, which is consistent with longer wavelength. 

Wait, but why does longer wavelength bend less? Because the refractive index depends on the wavelength. Shorter wavelengths (blue) are refracted more than longer ones (red). So in a prism, blue light bends more, which is why in a rainbow, blue is on the inner part. 

So all these points seem to confirm that red has a longer wavelength than blue. Therefore, the answer is yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
Yes. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Visible Light Spectrum:** Visible light spans wavelengths from approximately 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red).
2. **Color-Wavelength Relationship:** Within this range, blue light has shorter wavelengths (450–495 nm) compared to red light (620–750 nm).
3. **Inverse Relationship:** Wavelength (λ) and frequency (ν) are inversely related via $ c = \lambda \nu $, where $ c $ is the speed of light. Shorter wavelengths correspond to higher frequencies.
4. **Conclusion:** Since red light has a longer wavelength than blue light, the answer is **Yes**.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
