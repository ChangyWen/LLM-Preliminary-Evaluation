Okay, so the question is whether gold is more expensive than silver. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what "more expensive" means here. It probably refers to the price per unit weight, like per ounce or per gram. So I should compare the current market prices of gold and silver.

I remember that gold is generally more valuable than silver. But I should verify this. Let me recall some basic facts. Gold is a precious metal, often used in jewelry, electronics, and as a store of value. Silver is also a precious metal but is used more in industrial applications, like in electronics, photography, and as a component in some coins.

Now, looking at historical prices, gold has always been more expensive than silver. For example, in the past, the price of gold was around $1,000 to $2,000 per ounce, while silver was maybe $20 to $30 per ounce. But I need to check if this is still the case today. However, since I can't access real-time data, I'll have to rely on general knowledge up to 2023.

Another angle: the ratio between gold and silver. The gold-silver ratio is the number of ounces of silver it takes to buy one ounce of gold. If this ratio is, say, 80:1, that means gold is 80 times more expensive than silver. Historically, this ratio fluctuates but is usually above 50:1. So that would support the idea that gold is more expensive.

But wait, sometimes the ratio can be lower, like during periods of high inflation or economic uncertainty, when silver might outperform gold. However, even in those cases, gold is still typically more expensive. For example, if the ratio is 60:1, gold is still 60 times the price of silver.

Also, considering the supply and demand. Gold has a smaller supply compared to silver, which might contribute to its higher price. However, silver's industrial demand can affect its price more than gold's, which is more of a store of value. But even with that, the price per ounce of gold is still higher.

Another point: when you look at the price per gram, gold is more expensive. For instance, if gold is $50 per gram and silver is $0.50 per gram, then gold is 100 times more expensive. But I need to check typical prices. Let me think, as of recent years, gold is around $60 per gram, and silver is about $0.60 per gram. So that's a 100:1 ratio. That seems high, but maybe that's the case.

Wait, but I might be mixing up ounces and grams. Let me convert. One ounce is about 28 grams. If gold is, say, $2,000 per ounce, that's roughly $71.43 per gram. Silver at $25 per ounce would be about $0.89 per gram. So the ratio would be around 80:1. That seems more in line with historical averages.

So, putting it all together, gold is more expensive than silver in terms of price per ounce or per gram. The ratio is usually in the range of 50:1 to 100:1, depending on market conditions. Even if the ratio fluctuates, gold is consistently more expensive than silver. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Definition of "More Expensive":** The question refers to the price per unit weight (e.g., per ounce or gram) of gold versus silver.

2. **Historical and Market Context:** 
   - Gold has consistently been more valuable than silver due to its rarity, use as a store of value, and industrial applications.
   - The **gold-silver ratio** (ounces of silver needed to buy one ounce of gold) typically ranges between **50:1 and 100:1**, indicating gold is significantly more expensive.

3. **Price Comparison (as of recent years):**
   - **Gold:** ~$2,000 per ounce (~$71.43 per gram).
   - **Silver:** ~$25 per ounce (~$0.89 per gram).
   - This results in a ratio of ~80:1, confirming gold's higher price.

4. **Supply and Demand Factors:**
   - Gold has a smaller supply and is less affected by industrial demand compared to silver, which is used in electronics and other industries. However, even with these factors, gold remains more expensive.

5. **Conclusion:** Gold is consistently more expensive than silver in terms of price per unit weight, supported by historical data, market ratios, and supply-demand dynamics.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
