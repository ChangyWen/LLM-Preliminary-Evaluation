Okay, let's see. The question is whether Albert Einstein died later than Isaac Newton. Hmm, I need to figure out the dates of their deaths and compare them.

First, I should recall when Isaac Newton lived. I think he was from the 17th century. Let me remember... Newton was born in 1643, right? And he died in the early 18th century. Wait, I think he died in 1727. Let me confirm that. Yes, I believe Isaac Newton died on March 31, 1727.

Now, Albert Einstein. He was a 20th-century physicist. I know he was born in 1879. When did he die? I think he died in the 1950s. Maybe 1955? Let me think. Yes, Einstein died on April 18, 1955. 

So comparing the two dates: Newton died in 1727, Einstein in 1955. Since 1955 is later than 1727, Einstein died later than Newton. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

Wait, but I need to make sure I have the dates right. Let me double-check. Newton's death date: 1727, yes. Einstein's death date: 1955, correct. So yes, Einstein died later. No confusion here. The answer is Yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Determine Isaac Newton's death date:**  
   Isaac Newton died on **March 31, 1727**.

2. **Determine Albert Einstein's death date:**  
   Albert Einstein died on **April 18, 1955**.

3. **Compare the dates:**  
   - 1955 (Einstein's death year) is later than 1727 (Newton's death year).  
   - Even if considering the exact dates, April 18, 1955, is chronologically after March 31, 1727.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
