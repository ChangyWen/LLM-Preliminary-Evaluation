Okay, so I need to figure out if a blue whale has a larger heart than an elephant. Let me start by recalling what I know about these animals. Blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, right? They can be up to around 100 feet long and weigh as much as 200 tons. Elephants are also very large, but not as big as blue whales. I think the African bush elephant is the largest land animal, but even the biggest elephants are much smaller than a blue whale.

Now, the question is about their hearts. I remember that the size of an animal's heart is related to its body size. Larger animals generally have larger hearts. But I'm not sure about the exact sizes. Let me think. I've heard that the blue whale's heart is the largest of any animal. But how does that compare to an elephant's heart?

I should check the approximate sizes. From what I recall, the blue whale's heart can be as big as a car. Maybe a small car? Like a compact car? I think the heart of a blue whale can weigh around 1,000 pounds or more. Wait, that seems really heavy. Let me verify that. If a blue whale's heart is about 1,000 pounds, that's roughly 450 kilograms. 

Now, for an elephant. I think an elephant's heart is much smaller. Let me think about the weight. A large African elephant might weigh around 6,000 to 7,000 kilograms. But their heart... I think an elephant's heart is about 25 to 30 kilograms. That's like 55 to 66 pounds. So if the blue whale's heart is 450 kg, that's way bigger than the elephant's heart. 

Wait, but I need to make sure I'm not mixing up the numbers. Maybe I should think about the relative sizes. The blue whale is about 30 times heavier than an elephant. But does the heart scale linearly with body weight? I know that heart size doesn't scale exactly proportionally, but generally, larger animals have proportionally larger hearts. However, the blue whale is so much larger that even if the scaling isn't perfect, the heart would still be bigger. 

Another angle: I remember that the blue whale's heart is the largest in the world. If that's true, then it's bigger than any other animal's heart, including the elephant's. But I need to confirm if that's accurate. Maybe I can think of other large animals. For example, the heart of a blue whale is bigger than that of a dinosaur like the Argentinosaurus, but that's not relevant here. 

Alternatively, I can think of the heart size in terms of volume. The blue whale's heart is about the size of a car, which is roughly 3-4 cubic meters. An elephant's heart is much smaller, maybe a few liters. So in terms of volume, the blue whale's heart is way larger. 

Wait, but I should check if the elephant's heart is actually smaller. Let me think of the average sizes. A blue whale's heart is about 1.5 meters long and 1.5 meters wide. An elephant's heart is maybe 1 meter long? I think that's right. So in terms of dimensions, the blue whale's heart is bigger. 

Also, the blue whale's heart has to pump blood through a massive body. The circulatory system of a blue whale is enormous, so the heart needs to be large to handle that. In contrast, an elephant's circulatory system, while large for a land animal, is much smaller than that of a blue whale. 

So putting it all together: the blue whale's heart is significantly larger in both weight and size compared to an elephant's heart. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

Yes. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Body Size Comparison:** Blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, reaching lengths of up to 100 feet (30 meters) and weights of 200 tons (180 metric tonnes). African elephants, the largest land animals, weigh around 6–7 tonnes. This massive size difference implies a significant disparity in organ sizes, including the heart.

2. **Heart Size and Weight:** 
   - A blue whale's heart can weigh approximately **450 kg (1,000 lbs)** and measure **1.5 meters (5 feet) in length**. It is often compared in size to a small car.
   - An African elephant's heart weighs around **25–30 kg (55–66 lbs)** and is roughly **1 meter (3.3 feet) long**.

3. **Biological Scaling:** While heart size does not scale perfectly with body weight, the blue whale's immense body size necessitates a proportionally larger heart to circulate blood through its vast body. The elephant's heart, though large for a land animal, is dwarfed by the blue whale's.

4. **Conclusion:** The blue whale's heart is significantly larger in both weight and dimensions than an elephant's heart. 

**Final Answer:** Yes.
