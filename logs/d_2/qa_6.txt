**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether the article **"Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained"** was published earlier than **"Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal"**, we need to identify the **publication dates** of both articles.

However, the titles alone do not provide enough information to determine the order of publication. These could be headlines from **The New York Times**, **The Washington Post**, or other news outlets, and without specific dates or sources, it's not possible to definitively say which one was published first.

If you have access to the full articles or the dates they were published, I can help you compare them. Otherwise, I can guide you on how to find the publication dates for these articles. Would you like help with that?
