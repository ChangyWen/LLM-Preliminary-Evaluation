*********************************** End of Inputs **************************************




**************************************** Content ***************************************
No, **Hunters Point S Park Playground** in **Queens** is **not** located east of **Red Balloon Learning Center** in **Manhattan**.

Here's why:

- **Hunters Point S Park Playground** is located in **Queens**, New York City.
- **Red Balloon Learning Center** is located in **Manhattan**, New York City.
- Since they are in **different boroughs**, it's not accurate to say one is east or west of the other in a simple directional sense.

However, if you're asking about their relative positions on a map:

- **Queens** is to the **east of Manhattan**.
- So, **Hunters Point S Park Playground** (in Queens) is **east of Manhattan** as a whole, but **not specifically east of Red Balloon Learning Center**, which is a specific location within Manhattan.

In summary: **No**, Hunters Point S Park Playground is not located east of Red Balloon Learning Center.
