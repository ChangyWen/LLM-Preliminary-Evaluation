**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI is located west of The Ort Institute, IL, we need to look at the geographic locations of both places.

1. **University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI**:
   - Located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.
   - Coordinates: approximately 43.7167° N, 87.8333° W.

2. **The Ort Institute, IL**:
   - This is a bit ambiguous, as "The Ort Institute" is not a widely known or standard name for a specific institution in Illinois. However, if we assume it refers to a specific location in Illinois, we need to know its exact coordinates to compare.

Assuming "The Ort Institute" is a specific location in Illinois (e.g., a research institute, school, or organization), we would need its exact address or coordinates to determine the relative direction.

However, if we consider a general comparison:

- Wisconsin is to the west of Illinois.
- Sheboygan, WI is in the eastern part of Wisconsin, near the border with Illinois.

So, **University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is not located west of The Ort Institute, IL** — it is likely **east of Illinois** or **across the state line** to the west of Illinois, depending on where exactly "The Ort Institute" is located in Illinois.

If you can provide the exact location or coordinates of The Ort Institute, I can give you a more precise answer.
