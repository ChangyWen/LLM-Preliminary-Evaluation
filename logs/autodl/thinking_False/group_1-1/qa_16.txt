Is The Ort Institute, IL located west of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI?
*********************************** End of Inputs **************************************




**************************************** Content ***************************************
The Ort Institute is not a widely recognized or established institution, and there is no prominent or well-documented "The Ort Institute" located in Illinois (IL) or Wisconsin (WI) that is commonly referenced in academic or geographical databases.

However, assuming you are referring to a specific local or lesser-known institution, and given the names:

- **University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan** is located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.
- If there is a "The Ort Institute" in Illinois, it would be in a different state, and therefore **not west of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan**, since Illinois is east of Wisconsin.

If you meant a different location or institution, please provide more details so I can give you a more accurate answer.
