*********************************** End of Inputs **************************************




**************************************** Content ***************************************
No, **Red Balloon Learning Center** in **Manhattan** is **not located east of Hunters Point S Park Playground** in **Queens**.

Here's why:

- **Red Balloon Learning Center** is located in **Manhattan**, specifically in the **East Village** area.
- **Hunters Point S Park Playground** is located in **Queens**, in the **Astoria** neighborhood.
- **Manhattan** and **Queens** are two different boroughs of New York City, separated by the **East River**.
- Since **Manhattan** is across the river from **Queens**, it is **not east of** anything in **Queens** — it is actually **north of** Queens.

So, **Red Balloon Learning Center (Manhattan)** is **not east of** **Hunters Point S Park Playground (Queens)** — it's in a different borough entirely.
