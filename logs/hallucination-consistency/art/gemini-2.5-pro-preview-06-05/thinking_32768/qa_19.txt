Okay, let's see. The user wants a book by Truman Capote released on January 17, 1966. Alright, that's a specific date. First things first: I need to pull up Capote's major works. I know *Other Voices, Other Rooms* is early, and *Breakfast at Tiffany's* is even earlier. The big one, his most famous work, is *In Cold Blood* -- a "non-fiction novel," as I recall. I need to double-check that publication date, though. When was *In Cold Blood* actually *released*? A quick search for "In Cold Blood publication date" should do the trick. Ah, Random House, 1966... but did it hit the shelves on the 17th of January? Let me refine that search: "In Cold Blood release date January 17 1966." Yes! Multiple sources confirm it. Wikipedia, biographies, literary sites â€“ all point to January 17, 1966, as the official book publication date. It had been serialized in *The New Yorker* beforehand, but the book's the key here. So, the answer is *In Cold Blood*. It fits all the parameters. Okay, now to format the response exactly as instructed.

The famous book by Truman Capote released on January 17, 1966, is *In Cold Blood*.

In Cold Blood
