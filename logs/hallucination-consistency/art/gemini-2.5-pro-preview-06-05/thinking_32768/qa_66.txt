Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know the title of a specific book. Let me see... the author's Tomi Adeyemi, and the release date is March 6th, 2018. They also mentioned it's a "famous book."

Right, so let's break this down. My first thought is to formulate a quick search strategy. I'll try a few variations: "Tomi Adeyemi book 2018," then maybe "Tomi Adeyemi March 6 2018 book," and also "Tomi Adeyemi famous book."

Now, let's actually *execute* that search – in my mental library, of course.  Ah, the name "Tomi Adeyemi" immediately clicks with the *Legacy of Orïsha* series. That series, right? The first book... that's famous. What's the title?  *Children of Blood and Bone*!  I should just double-check the release date, though. I'll mentally search "Children of Blood and Bone release date."  Yep, March 6, 2018, confirmed!

Alright, synthesizing the answer now. The user wants the book title. It's by Tomi Adeyemi, and it came out March 6, 2018. Okay, the answer's *Children of Blood and Bone*.

Now, the final format. I need to start with a conversational sentence, something like "The famous book by Tomi Adeyemi released on March 6, 2018, is..." Then, state the title clearly, and crucially, the user wants the final answer on a new line at the end.

Okay, let me review this. Does it answer the question? Yes. Is it on a new line? Yep. Is it accurate? Absolutely.

Therefore, the answer is: The famous book by Tomi Adeyemi that was released on March 6, 2018, is *Children of Blood and Bone*.

Children of Blood and Bone
