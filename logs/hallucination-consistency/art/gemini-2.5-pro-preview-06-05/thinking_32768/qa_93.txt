Okay, here's how I'll approach this. The core question is clear: what's that famous Richard Dawkins book released on October 2, 2006? Alright, let's break it down. Dawkins, 2006, famous book. Right off the bat, my expert knowledge flags *The God Delusion* and *The Selfish Gene* as likely candidates. *The Selfish Gene* is definitely older, 1976, so it's out. *The God Delusion*, that's the one, I'm almost certain. Just to be absolutely sure about that date... yes, September 18, 2006, in the UK. The US publication dateâ€¦ ah, October 2, 2006! Perfect. That's it!

Now, to construct the answer. Keep it simple, direct, and in line with the formatting instructions.

The famous book by Richard Dawkins that was released on October 2, 2006, is *The God Delusion*.

*The God Delusion*
