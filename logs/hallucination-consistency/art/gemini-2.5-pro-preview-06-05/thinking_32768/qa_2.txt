Okay, let's see. The user wants to know the name of a famous Dean Koontz book that came out on May 10, 1981. Right, I can work with that.

First, I need to isolate the key information: Dean Koontz, 1981-05-10, and "famous book." Then, I should map out a search strategy. I'll start broad: "Dean Koontz books 1981". That should bring up a shortlist. After that, I can narrow it down with date-specific searches or by checking the publication dates for the prominent titles.

Let's see... "Dean Koontz books 1981"... Okay, right off the bat, *The Eyes of Darkness* is popping up, often listed under the Leigh Nichols pseudonym, and *The Funhouse* and *The Mask*, under the Owen West pseudonym. Those are good candidates. I know the first one is well known, and it seems like the best starting point. Let's check release dates. *The Funhouse* was from a movie adaptation and *The Mask* is the other Koontz book. The *Eyes of Darkness*, with the Leigh Nichols name, does have an interesting history.

But wait, the specific date is May 10th, 1981. Let me try a targeted search: "Dean Koontz book released May 10 1981". That should zero in on it. Yes, there it is! *The Eyes of Darkness*. It's widely cited as having a May 10, 1981 publication date.

Now, is it *famous*? Oh, absolutely. *The Eyes of Darkness* gained HUGE notoriety in recent years...2020, I think it was. It became a talking point around the world, due to some eerie parallels to the Covid-19 pandemic that some readers found. It was a bestseller, so yes, it absolutely fits the criteria.

Alright, I'll get it all down in the response, making sure to be clear about the pseudonym and the recent fame.

*The Eyes of Darkness*
