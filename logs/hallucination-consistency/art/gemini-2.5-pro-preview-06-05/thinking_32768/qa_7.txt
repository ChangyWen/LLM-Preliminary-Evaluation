Okay, let's see. The user needs a book title. First, I need to understand the specific question: they want a book title, likely based on author and release date. Alright, I know Stephen King's work well. The user gave me the author, Stephen King, and the release date, September 24th, 2013.

Now, how to proceed. My initial thought is to use my internal database – my deep knowledge of King’s bibliography. Then, I can form a query in my mind, something like "Stephen King books 2013" or even more specific, “Stephen King book released September 24th, 2013”.

A mental check – ah yes, I recall a major Stephen King novel released around that time. It's a sequel, to *The Shining*, if memory serves. Let me quickly confirm. Yes, it was *Doctor Sleep*. Hmm, to be absolutely certain, let's quickly check the *exact* release date by searching "Doctor Sleep release date." Okay, confirmed - September 24, 2013.

Next, synthesis. I need to provide a concise answer. I should start by directly giving the book title. I should also give a little context, that it's a sequel to the *Shining* is useful information. Make sure the answer is clear and the information is correct.

The user wants the book title on a new line. I am good with that. And, the response is complete.

The answer is: The book by Stephen King released on September 24, 2013, is *Doctor Sleep*. It's a sequel to *The Shining*.
