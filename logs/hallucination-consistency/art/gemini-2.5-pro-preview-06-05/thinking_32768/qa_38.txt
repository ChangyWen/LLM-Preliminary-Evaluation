Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous book by Khaled Hosseini, specifically one released on May 22nd, 2007. Hmm, right, so my first step is to identify the key elements: author, release date, and the fact it's a "famous book". I need to formulate a plan. I know his big books, so let's think... *The Kite Runner* was first, no, not that one. Okay, so I need to quickly check the release dates of the other ones. I know he has *A Thousand Splendid Suns* and *And the Mountains Echoed*. *A Thousand Splendid Suns*, that's the one. I recall it's his second book. So, quick search for "A Thousand Splendid Suns release date"... Yep, May 22, 2007. That's it! Now to assemble the answer, ensuring it's clear and concise. The user asked for a "famous book," and *A Thousand Splendid Suns* certainly fits that description. I need to remember the formatting â€“ the final answer goes on a new line. Right. My response should be a single sentence identifying the book and then the book's title on the next line. Okay, here goes: The famous book by Khaled Hosseini that was released on May 22, 2007, is *A Thousand Splendid Suns*.

A Thousand Splendid Suns
