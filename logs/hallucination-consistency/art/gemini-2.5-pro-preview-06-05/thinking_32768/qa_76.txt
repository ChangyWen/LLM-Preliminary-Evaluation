Okay, here's how I'd approach this, as if I were thinking it through:

Right, so the user wants the name of a famous book, and they've provided two crucial pieces of information: the author's name, Steven Levitt, and the release date, April 12, 2005. Now, "Steven Levitt" and "famous book" – that instantly makes me think of *Freakonomics*. It's practically a household name, a classic in its field.

But I can't just assume, I need to verify. Let's check the details. *Freakonomics*… is Steven Levitt the author? Yes, he *is* a co-author, with Stephen J. Dubner. Important to note that. And the release date? Okay, a quick search confirms it: April 12, 2005. Publisher sites, Wikipedia, everything aligns.

So, the answer, as directly as possible: The famous book by Steven Levitt that was released on April 12, 2005, is *Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything*. It was co-authored with Stephen J. Dubner.
