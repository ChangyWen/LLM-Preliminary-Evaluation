*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the title of a specific book. Alright, let's break this down. They're asking about a famous book, which means it's likely a known work. I've got the author, Garrard Conley, and the release date, May 10, 2016.

Now, let's formulate a search query. Something like "Garrard Conley book 2016" or "Garrard Conley May 10 2016 book" should do the trick. I can either consult my internal knowledge base, which is pretty vast, or I could quickly use a search engine. Either way, the search results should lead me directly to Conley's memoir.

Okay, the title is *Boy Erased: A Memoir*. Now, let me double-check that publication date. Wikipedia, Goodreads, maybe the publisher's website—Penguin Random House, if I remember correctly—should confirm it. Yes, May 10, 2016, spot on. And is it "famous"? Absolutely. Critically acclaimed, a bestseller, and it was adapted into a major motion picture with some serious talent attached. Definitely qualifies.

Right. Now, to synthesize the answer. I'll state the book title first, then include the author and date, just to be absolutely clear I've understood the query correctly. Then, I'll place the final answer as requested.

The famous book by Garrard Conley released on May 10, 2016, is *Boy Erased: A Memoir*.

Boy Erased: A Memoir
