Okay, the user's asking for a famous book by Neil Gaiman released on May 10, 1990. Right, let's break this down. I need Gaiman, that specific date, and the fact that it's a *famous* book.

First, I'll consider my mental Rolodex of Gaiman's work. What comes to mind immediately? That would be *Good Omens*, the one he did with Terry Pratchett. I'm almost certain that's from around that time and certainly *famous*. Let's verify the date. Hmm, I should do a search, just to be sure. Actually, no, I'm fairly certain, it was in May 1990. The UK release date.

Yes, *Good Omens* it is. And it was a collaboration with Terry Pratchett, which is important to acknowledge since the question framed it as solely Gaiman's creation, when in fact, he co-authored it. Okay, so let's formulate the answer. Make it direct.

The answer to your question is *Good Omens*, co-authored with Terry Pratchett, and released in the UK on May 10, 1990.

*Good Omens*
