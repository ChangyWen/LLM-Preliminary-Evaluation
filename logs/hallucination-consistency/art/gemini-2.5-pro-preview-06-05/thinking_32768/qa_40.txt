Okay, let's see. The user wants to know the name of a specific book. Alright, key details: Mark Manson, 2016, "famous book". Right, right, I know this. Hmm, what's the best way to find it? Let's search for "Mark Manson book 2016" or maybe "Mark Manson book September 13 2016". Manson is a pretty well-known figure; I'm pretty sure I know what this is. Yes, his most famous book came out around that time. It's "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck". Gotta double-check the date though. A quick search... Yep, hardcover released on September 13, 2016, by HarperOne. Perfect!

Now, let's formulate the response. Okay, directly answer the question. Provide some context, and then give the title. It needs to be on a new line at the end.

So, "The famous book by Mark Manson that was released on September 13, 2016, is *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life*." Then, the new line and then the *final* answer. The user asked for *the* book. The full title, or the abbreviated title? Hmm, the main title is probably what they want, and that's cleaner. Okay, let's stick with the main title for the final answer.
