Okay, here's how I'm going to tackle this. First, the user needs the name of a well-known book. Fine, simple enough. I need to identify the author, Joseph Heller, and the release date: October 10, 1961. I’ll cross-reference that information with my existing knowledge.

My first step is to search for books by Joseph Heller. I'll quickly scan the list. Aha, *Catch-22*, *Something Happened*, and *Good as Gold* all pop up. Next, I'll look for a release date match, focusing on October 10, 1961. A quick search, like "Joseph Heller Catch-22 release date," should confirm it.

Then, I’ll verify if the identified book is indeed famous. A query like "Is Catch-22 famous?" will quickly confirm its literary standing. Yes, *Catch-22* is a prominent novel, it's practically a cultural touchstone, and it gave us the term "catch-22," which I'm sure the user already knows!

Therefore, I'll start by answering the question directly. I'll then confirm the author and release date to demonstrate I fully understood the question. Finally, I'll add a quick, engaging fact about the book, providing some added value to the answer. I will also adhere to the format, so the ultimate answer is on a new line. Okay, here's the final answer.

The famous book by Joseph Heller that was released on October 10, 1961, is the satirical World War II novel *Catch-22*.
