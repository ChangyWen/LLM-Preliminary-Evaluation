Alright, let's break this down. The user wants to know the name of a famous book released on September 13, 2007, written by Pablo Fenjves. Okay, I can handle this. My first thought is to start with the obvious: search for "Pablo Fenjves book 2007," "Pablo Fenjves September 13 2007," and maybe even "books by Pablo Fenjves."

Aha! The first search hits on something related to O.J. Simpson. Let's see... "If I Did It." But wait, didn't I read something about Pablo Fenjves being involved? Yes, he's the ghostwriter. That's key. It explains why his name might not be the primary author, but he definitely "created" it in the context of the question.

Okay, let's dig into *If I Did It*. Check the release date. Wikipedia... other sources... yep, Beaufort Books, September 13, 2007. Bingo! Matches the date perfectly. And is it famous? Oh, absolutely. Infamous, really. Given the circumstances, the trial, the content, the legal battles, the Goldman family's actions... the book is known, for sure.

Therefore, the answer must be *If I Did It*. I'll make sure to emphasize that Pablo Fenjves was the ghostwriter, even though it was attributed to O.J. Simpson, to address the "created by" aspect of the question. And of course, it was released on September 13, 2007.

Right, I'll begin my response with the name of the book, then the context.

The famous book ghostwritten by Pablo Fenjves and released on September 13, 2007, is *If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer*.

*If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer*
