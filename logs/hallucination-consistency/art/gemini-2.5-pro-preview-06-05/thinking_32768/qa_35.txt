Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific book. They want to know the name of a particular book. Right. The request specified N. K. Jemisin, a release date of August 4, 2015, and, implicitly, that it's a "famous" book. Got it. So, the core question is: what's that famous Jemisin book released on that date?

First, I'll extract the keywords: Jemisin, August 4, 2015, famous. Now, let's formulate a strategy. I'll quickly brainstorm, leaning on my knowledge base. I know Jemisin is a major player in contemporary fantasy and sci-fi, so this should be straightforward. I will search my internal library, then if needed, I can quickly search the web if needed.

Okay. *The Broken Earth* trilogy comes to mind immediately. That's Jemisin's most celebrated work, and the *Broken Earth* trilogy sounds right. The first book in that trilogy is *The Fifth Season*. Let's check that release date. Yes, I'm quite certain that's the one. A quick confirmation search reveals that it was, indeed, published on August 4, 2015. And is it famous? Absolutely. Won the Hugo Award. Twice. No, three times! All three books won Hugo awards! Extremely famous. So I have the name, author, and the date.

Time to synthesize the answer. I'll answer directly, offering context to confirm I've nailed the right one. I need to make this smooth and informative.

The famous book by N. K. Jemisin that was released on August 4, 2015, is *The Fifth Season*. It is the first novel in her highly acclaimed *Broken Earth* trilogy.

The Fifth Season
