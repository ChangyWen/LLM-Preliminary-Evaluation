Okay, let's get this done. The user wants the name of a famous book. My first step is to identify the key details. I have the author, Garth Stein, a release year of 2008, and the attribute "famous."

Now, I need to search my internal knowledge base. I'll formulate the query: "Garth Stein book 2008" or maybe "Garth Stein famous book". Immediately, *The Art of Racing in the Rain* springs to mind. I know that's his most well-known novel.

I should probably verify the publication date just to be absolutely sure. I'll search for "The Art of Racing in the Rain publication date". Aha! The search shows a publication date of May 13, 2008, though. Hmm, the user's date is slightly different - January 1, 2008. That's a common enough error. People often remember the year, but not the precise date. It's still incredibly likely they're looking for *The Art of Racing in the Rain* given the author and the 2008 timeframe. The error is negligible, really.

So, the user is asking for a *name*, and I need to be direct. I'll state the answer plainly. The core information points directly to the book, and that's the key.

The instructions said to put the final answer on a new line. Right. I'll start with a sentence providing context, then a blank line, and finally, the answer as requested.

Okay, here goes.

The famous book by Garth Stein that was released in 2008 is *The Art of Racing in the Rain*.
