Okay, so the user wants to know the name of a book. Got it. Let's see, it's by Suzanne Collins, and it came out around May 19, 2020. It's also supposed to be a "famous" book.

Suzanne Collins... immediately *The Hunger Games* pops to mind. I remember there was a new release a few years ago. Okay, my knowledge base links her primarily to that series. Let's narrow it down with a quick search. "Suzanne Collins book 2020." Yes, there was a prequel. Right, it was a big deal. Let's see if I can just recall the exact title and date... Hmm, maybe not quite. I can recall the *concept* but not the precise details.

Alright, time for a quick search to confirm and refine. "Suzanne Collins book released May 19 2020". Perfect. *The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes*. That's the one. It's a prequel, like I thought. And it certainly fits the "famous" criteria; it was a huge release. A bestseller, and it was adapted into a major film. It's all there.

The famous book by Suzanne Collins released on that date is *The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes*.

The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes
