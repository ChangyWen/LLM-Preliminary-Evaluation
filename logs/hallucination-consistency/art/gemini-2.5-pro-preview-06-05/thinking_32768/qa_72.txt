*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, the user wants to know the name of a book, a famous one at that. Alright, let's see. The specifics given are a release date: February 19, 1963, and the author is Betty Friedan.  The book is supposed to be "famous," which is a key qualifier.

My next step is to search my internal knowledge base, or more accurately, pull from what I already know. I'm thinking something like "Betty Friedan book 1963" or maybe "Betty Friedan famous book."

Betty Friedan... right, she's a major figure in feminist literature.  Her most well-known work *has* to be *The Feminine Mystique*.  Let me quickly verify the date... yes, February 19, 1963.  Perfect.

Okay, author is Betty Friedan. Release date, 1963-02-19. The book is, without a doubt, *The Feminine Mystique* â€“ and it's *definitely* considered her most famous and influential work.  It's practically synonymous with the start of the second wave of feminism in the United States. So, all the pieces fit.

Now, I need to synthesize this into a clear answer, starting with the obvious. I should answer the question directly and conversational. And remember, the final answer goes on a new line, as requested.

So, I'll start with "The famous book released on February 19, 1963, by Betty Friedan is *The Feminine Mystique*."
