Okay, let's get this done. The user wants the name of a famous book by Joël Dicker, released on September 19, 2012. Right, so I need to access my mental database, or if that fails, I'll run a quick search. My first thought is that his most famous work is *The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair*. But, let's check the date. I'll look up "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair release date" or, better yet, the original French title's release date: *La Vérité sur l'Affaire Harry Quebert* date de sortie. Yep, Wikipedia and other sources confirm the French release was indeed September 19, 2012. Alright, that's the key piece of info. The date corresponds to the original publication.

Now, how to phrase the answer... I'll give the English title since it's what most people will know, but I should also mention the date relates to the original French publication. So, the answer should be clear and concise, stating the book title and the contextual sentence. Perfect.

The famous book by Joël Dicker released on that date is *The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair*. The September 19, 2012, release date corresponds to its original publication in French under the title *La Vérité sur l'Affaire Harry Quebert*.
