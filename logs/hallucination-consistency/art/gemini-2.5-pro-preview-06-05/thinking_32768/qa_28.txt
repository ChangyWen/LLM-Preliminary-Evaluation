Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know a specific Stephen King book's name, released on April 5th, 1974. Right, so I need to quickly identify the book. I immediately think of *Carrie*. That's the only thing that comes to mind when I hear Stephen King and a very early publication date. Now, let me confirm. April 5th, 1974... Yes, *Carrie* was his first published novel. Excellent. The date is right, the author is right, and the user asked for a famous book, so *Carrie* certainly fits the bill. I'll provide the answer concisely, including the fact that it's his debut novel, and then format it as requested.

The famous book by Stephen King released on April 5, 1974, is his debut novel, *Carrie*.

*Carrie*
