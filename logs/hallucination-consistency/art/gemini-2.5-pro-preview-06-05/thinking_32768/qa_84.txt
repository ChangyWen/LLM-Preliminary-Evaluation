Okay, here's what I'm thinking. Someone wants to know the title of a famous Isaac Asimov book released on December 2nd, 1950. Right, let me break this down.

First, I need to zero in on the core information. The key bits are Asimov, that specific date (December 2, 1950), and "famous book." Okay, let's craft a search strategy. I'll probably start with a general search like "Isaac Asimov books released 1950." Or maybe "Isaac Asimov book release date December 2 1950." I know he had several key works early in his career. I should try searching for individual books by title and date of publication too, just to confirm.

I'm thinking of *Pebble in the Sky*, *I, Robot*, and *The Stars, Like Dust*, as those were major works released around that time. *Foundation* came a little later, in 1951. Okay, let's see... *Pebble in the Sky* was earlier in 1950, so that's out. *I, Robot*... ah, yes. My internal database confirms that *I, Robot* was indeed published on December 2, 1950, by Gnome Press! That seems like a perfect fit. Let me check the date for *The Stars, Like Dust* - yeah, that one's 1951, and so is *Foundation*.

Now, let me verify. Date matches, Asimov's the author, and *I, Robot* is definitely a well-known book, especially given its introduction of the Three Laws of Robotics. Excellent.

Right, I need to construct a response. I'll start by directly answering the question. I'll include a little bit of context, like that it's a collection of stories, and the whole Three Laws thing. That should cover the "famous" part. And let me make sure I put my final answer on a new line. Okay, the draft is: "The famous book by Isaac Asimov released on December 2, 1950, is *I, Robot*. This iconic work is a collection of nine short stories that introduced his influential Three Laws of Robotics."

Final check: does this answer the question? Yes. Is it accurate? Absolutely. Does it follow formatting instructions? Yep. Okay, ready to deliver.

I, Robot
