Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a specific piece of information, the name of a famous Truman Capote book released on January 17, 1966. Alright, straight to the point.

First, I need to extract the relevant details: Author: Capote, Date: January 17, 1966, and "famous book" is the type.

Now, time to tap into my existing knowledge. Let's see... Capote... known for... *Other Voices, Other Rooms*, definitely *Breakfast at Tiffany's*, and of course, *In Cold Blood*. I'll need to check the publication dates. Hmm... *In Cold Blood* was released in the mid-60s, wasn't it? A quick search of my go-to resources – Wikipedia, literary databases – will confirm the exact date. Ah, yes! *In Cold Blood*, published by Random House, January 17, 1966. Perfect! It was serialized earlier in *The New Yorker*, but the book publication date is the key here, which matches the user's date precisely.

And, for good measure, I should add a little something extra. *In Cold Blood* is a landmark in the non-fiction novel genre, a truly groundbreaking work, it's practically his magnum opus. The user, being an expert like myself, will certainly appreciate that. And, of course, the plot - a must.

So, let's put it all together. The answer is *In Cold Blood*, and it's an excellent piece of writing.

The famous book by Truman Capote released on January 17, 1966, is *In Cold Blood*. It is a pioneering work of the non-fiction novel genre, detailing the 1959 murders of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas.
