Okay, the user's question is straightforward: they want the name of a famous book. First, I need to pull out the key details – author Steven Levitt and the release date, April 12, 2005. Immediately, my internal knowledge base screams "*Freakonomics*!" I should verify, though. Levitt *is* the author, and it was co-written with Stephen J. Dubner. The date... yep, April 12, 2005. Perfect match! *Freakonomics* was huge – a massive bestseller, definitely a "famous book." My plan is to answer directly, mentioning the co-author because it's important to the book, and provide the full title since the prompt doesn't limit it. Then, I will output the final answer on a new line as the instructions requested. Let's craft the perfect response. It should be accurate, helpful, and follow all formatting instructions. The final answer should be plain text on its own line. Let's do this.

The famous book by Steven Levitt, co-authored with Stephen J. Dubner, released on April 12, 2005, is *Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything*.
