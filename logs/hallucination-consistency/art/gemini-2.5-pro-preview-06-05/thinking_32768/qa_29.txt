Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a specific book title. Right. My core question is: which book? Let me break this down methodically. I need the book's name. I know the author is Kevin Kwan and the release date is May 23, 2017. Now to strategize. I could do a quick online search for "Kevin Kwan books released 2017," or maybe "Kevin Kwan book May 23 2017." Alternatively, I can tap into my existing knowledge base.

I know Kevin Kwan. He's the *Crazy Rich Asians* guy. Let's see... I recall the trilogy. The first was *Crazy Rich Asians* in 2013, then *China Rich Girlfriend* in 2015. The third one... Ah, *Rich People Problems*. Okay, let's quickly double-check that release date. A quick fact-check, and yep, *Rich People Problems* by Kevin Kwan was indeed published on May 23, 2017.

So, I need to answer clearly. The book is *Rich People Problems*, by Kevin Kwan, released on the date provided. I should mention that it's the final book in the trilogy for context. The response should be in sentence form, then the book's title on a new line, exactly as requested. Iâ€™m ready to deliver the answer.

The famous book by Kevin Kwan released on May 23, 2017, is *Rich People Problems*. It is the third and final novel in his *Crazy Rich Asians* trilogy.

Rich People Problems
