Okay, let's see. The user wants to know a famous book by Tolkien released on September 15th, 1977. Right. I need to pull up my mental Tolkien library. Obviously, *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* are out, they predate that date. *The Adventures of Tom Bombadil* too. Hmm, I think there's a posthumous work... *The Silmarillion*. Now, was *that* the date? I need to double-check the publication date of *The Silmarillion*. Okay, a quick search confirms it: September 15th, 1977. Bingo. And yeah, *The Silmarillion* fits the description â€“ a major work that absolutely deserves the "famous" label, even if it was published after his death and edited by Christopher Tolkien. So, to be precise, the answer should be...

*The Silmarillion* was published posthumously, and edited by his son, Christopher Tolkien.

The Silmarillion
