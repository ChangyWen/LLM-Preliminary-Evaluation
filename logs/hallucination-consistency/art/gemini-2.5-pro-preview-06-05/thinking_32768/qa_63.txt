Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous book by Tolkien released on July 29, 1954. Right. I know Tolkien; *The Lord of the Rings* is the big one. Now, when was it published? I recall it was released in volumes. Okay, I need to look up the publication dates of the volumes. *The Fellowship of the Ring*... Ah, that was July 29, 1954! And that's the first volume, part of the larger work, *The Lord of the Rings*. That's the one. The user is probably thinking of the whole series, but they gave a specific date. So, the best response is to give the specific volume's name along with its context. That provides the most precise and helpful answer, I think.

The book released on that date was *The Fellowship of the Ring*, which is the first volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's epic fantasy novel, *The Lord of the Rings*.
The Fellowship of the Ring
