Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the name of a famous book. Let's see... The key pieces are a release date – September 11, 2001 – and the author, Yann Martel. Right. Time to formulate a search. My mind immediately goes to "Yann Martel book 2001." Or, perhaps a more precise search, "Yann Martel book released September 11 2001."

Ah, I know! Yann Martel wrote *Life of Pi*. Let me double-check that publication date... Yes, according to Wikipedia, *Life of Pi* was indeed first published in Canada by Knopf Canada on September 11, 2001. Now, is *Life of Pi* considered "famous"? Absolutely. It's won awards, been adapted into a massive film, and is a staple in literature courses. The "famous" criterion is definitely met.

Okay, let's put this all together. I'll answer the question directly, confirming the book and the author. And, I'll acknowledge the date; it's such a specific and memorable detail, especially considering the events of that day. It's almost jarring, the juxtaposition of a date like that with the release of such a beloved book. The user knows their stuff, so they'll understand the connection.

The famous book by Yann Martel that was released on September 11, 2001, is *Life of Pi*.

Life of Pi
