Okay, so the question is asking for the name of a famous book by Madonna released on October 21, 1992. Let me break this down. Madonna… right, primarily known for music, but she definitely branched out into other areas. I recall something significant in the early 90s, around the time of *Erotica*... that album was definitely tied to something else, something quite… provocative. Yes! The coffee table book, *Sex*. I need to verify the specifics, but the pieces are falling into place.

Let me quickly confirm the date. October 21st, 1992… a quick search for "Madonna Sex book release date" confirms it. Conceived and written by her, and it was *wildly* famous. Okay, synthesizing the answer: it was a coffee table book, extremely controversial, and perfectly complements that *Erotica* era. The question specifically wants the *name* of the book, and a final answer on a new line.

The famous book created by Madonna and released on October 21, 1992, is her controversial coffee table book titled *Sex*.
