Okay, let's see... the user wants to know about a famous book by Robert Kiyosaki released on April 1, 2000. Alright, so Kiyosaki... that means "Rich Dad Poor Dad," right? His most famous work, definitely. April 1, 2000... hmm. I know the original version was self-published way before that. Let me double-check on the release date for the wide release. Maybe "Robert Kiyosaki book release date April 1 2000" will do it, or maybe just "Rich Dad Poor Dad release date."

Right, the initial self-published version was in '97. But the major push, the one that made it *the* book, that was through a larger publisher, Warner Books, right? Let me see... Ah, yes! Mass-market paperback, Warner Books, April 1, 2000. Perfect. That's the exact date the user specified. Okay, so here's the answer.

The famous book by Robert Kiyosaki released on April 1, 2000, is *Rich Dad Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do not!*. While it was first self-published in 1997, the mass-market edition that became a massive bestseller was released on that date.

*Rich Dad Poor Dad*
