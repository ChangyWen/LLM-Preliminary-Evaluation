Okay, so the user wants to know the name of a famous book. The crucial details are that it was somehow connected to Stephen Dubner and released on April 12, 2005. Dubner's a journalist, right? And the date is very specific. Right away, my mind jumps to somethingâ€¦ *Freakonomics*. Dubner and... who was the economist? Oh yeah, Steven Levitt. Let's see. When was it published? Ah, yes, April 12, 2005. That confirms it. Absolutely. The question was about something *created* by Dubner, and while he was a co-author, that fits the bill perfectly.

The book is *Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything*
