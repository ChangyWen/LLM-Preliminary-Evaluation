Okay, let's break this down. The user needs the name of a famous Neil Gaiman book released on July 2, 2002. Simple enough. My first step is always to isolate the core question, which is the title of the book. Then, I need to pinpoint the key information: Gaiman, that date (2002-07-02), and the "famous" descriptor.

Now, the strategy. I’ll probably start by recalling Gaiman's work. "American Gods" is a big one, but I'm pretty sure that's not the right date, so that's one to check. I'll do a quick search to see what Gaiman published in 2002. If that doesn't immediately give me the title, I'll refine the search to include the specific date.  "Neil Gaiman books released in 2002" is a good starting point. Then I'll confirm the *exact* release date once I find the most likely candidate; I'll look to Wikipedia or the publisher's site, as these will likely have the most accurate information. I have to make sure I find the *US* date, as that is the one provided in the request.

Alright, the first search brings up *Coraline* immediately.  I know it's a well-known work.  Now, to nail down the date.  "Coraline book release date" should do it.  Then let's get more specific: "Coraline book US release date."

Bingo! *Coraline* – Wikipedia says it was published July 2, 2002, in the US. The 2002 date matches up with the prompt. Furthermore, *Coraline* is definitely "famous". The film adaptation alone solidified its status. It also won a Hugo Award and a Bram Stoker Award. I’m satisfied with this, as *Coraline* is a very well-known book.

Time to formulate the answer. I’ll directly answer the question, mentioning both author and date to demonstrate I understand the question fully. And then, I need to format the answer exactly as the user has requested.  Let's double-check...Yes, the title of the book on a new line is the final, separate step.

Here we go:

The famous book by Neil Gaiman released on July 2, 2002, is *Coraline*.

*Coraline*
