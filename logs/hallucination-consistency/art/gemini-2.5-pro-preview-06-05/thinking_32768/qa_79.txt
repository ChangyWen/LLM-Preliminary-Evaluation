Okay, let's break this down. The user needs the name of a famous book. Hmm, well, the date is April 12, 2005, and the author is Stephen Dubner. Right off the bat, the name "Stephen Dubner" clicks something in my internal database. Journalist, author... I'm thinking *Freakonomics*.

I'll need to verify, though. Let's see, who co-authored that one? Ah, yes, Steven D. Levitt. And the publication date...Yep, April 12th, 2005. Perfect match! And "famous"? Undeniably. A huge hit.

The user asked for the book, specifically by Dubner, and on that date. Got it. I need to be precise and follow instructions. So, the answer is: *Freakonomics*. But, I'll be complete and include the full title, along with the co-author, because it's all connected. Let's go with something like:

The famous book created by Stephen Dubner and released on April 12, 2005, is *Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything*. He co-authored it with the economist Steven D. Levitt.
