Okay, so the user is asking about a famous book by Heinlein published on November 5, 1959. Hmm, let me see... I need to recall what Heinlein published around that time. First things first, I know the author is Robert A. Heinlein, the date is November 5, 1959, and the key is a *famous* book.

Right, that gives me a clear search strategy.  I'll start by thinking about his most famous works, the ones that have resonated through the genre and pop culture. *Stranger in a Strange Land* came later... *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress* is also a strong contender, but I'm pretty sure it came out after the target date. Ah, *Starship Troopers*... that's definitely up there in terms of fame and controversy, but I need to verify that publication date.

My gut tells me *Starship Troopers* is the answer. Let's check that.  I'll run a quick mental search using my established knowledge base. Yep, *Starship Troopers* is certainly a high-profile work. Now, when was it released?  A quick fact-check using my mental archive... I'm thinking November, perhaps. I remember seeing something about a magazine serialization. Let's pin down the hardcover release date, just to be completely certain. Wikipedia or another reliable source is always a good start. Okay, yes, my memory serves! November 5, 1959.

Perfect! So, the author is Heinlein, the date is confirmed, and the book is *Starship Troopers*. It's undeniably famous. The user wanted a clear and concise answer, and they also requested it formatted a certain way.

The famous book by Robert A. Heinlein released on November 5, 1959, is *Starship Troopers*.

*Starship Troopers*
