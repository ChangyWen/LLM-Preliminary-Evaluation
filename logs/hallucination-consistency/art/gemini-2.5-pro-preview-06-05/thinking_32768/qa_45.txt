Okay, so the question is about a famous book by James Baldwin released on June 17, 1974. Right, let's see... My mind immediately goes to Baldwin – a literary giant. What are his major works? Okay, *Go Tell It on the Mountain*, *Notes of a Native Son*, *The Fire Next Time*, *Giovanni's Room*, and... yes, *If Beale Street Could Talk*. That's definitely one of his more prominent novels, and I have a feeling it was from the 70s. The publication date is the crucial piece.

Let's verify. I could search "James Baldwin books published in 1974" but that feels a little broad. Let's narrow it down; "If Beale Street Could Talk publication date" is the better approach. Ah yes, 1974. Just to be absolutely sure, let's try "If Beale Street Could Talk release date June 17 1974". Perfect. Wikipedia and the publisher sites – The Dial Press, in this case – they all point to 1974, and many give June 17, 1974, as the official release date in the US.

Okay, so we've got it. The question is answered. It's *If Beale Street Could Talk*. It fits all the criteria; Baldwin, 1974 release, and it's certainly a famous novel.

Now for the response. Straight to the point. "The famous book by James Baldwin released on June 17, 1974, is his novel *If Beale Street Could Talk*." Now for the formatting the user requested:
