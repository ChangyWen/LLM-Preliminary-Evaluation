Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know the title of a famous book that came out on September 13, 2007, and was created by Pablo Fenjves.

Right, so, I need to find a book title, that's the key. I've got a date, 2007-09-13, and the author, Pablo Fenjves. Let's get started with a quick search for "Pablo Fenjves book 2007" and "book released 2007-09-13." I could also try combining them, "Pablo Fenjves book released 2007-09-13."

Hmm, the first search, "Pablo Fenjves book 2007," brings up something interesting: *If I Did It*. Okay, now, let's dig a bit deeper. The book is attributed to O. J. Simpson, but I *know* Fenjves was the ghostwriter. That certainly fits the "created by" part of the question. So, let's check the release date for *If I Did It*. Yep, quick search, and it was released on September 13, 2007. And of course, it's a very famous book.

Perfect. Everything lines up! The user wants a famous book. *If I Did It* is famously controversial. They mentioned the author as Fenjves - the ghostwriter checks out. And the date is spot on. 

So, here's the answer I'll give: *If I Did It* was ghostwritten by Pablo Fenjves and officially attributed to O. J. Simpson, and it was released on the requested date.

*If I Did It*
