Okay, so the user is asking for the name of a famous book.  Let's see... they know the author is Eoin Colfer, and the publication date is April 26, 2001. I need to identify the book.  Right, Eoin Colfer... that brings to mind *Artemis Fowl*. It's a popular series, so it fits the "famous" criteria.  I should double-check the release date.  Let's see, *Artemis Fowl*, first book... I can practically see the cover. I'm pretty sure the first book came out around that time.  A quick mental check... ah, the UK publication date, yes, 2001. Specifically, the UK and Ireland date was indeed April 26, 2001.  Okay, so author's correct, date's correct, and *Artemis Fowl* is definitely the first in the series and is quite well-known. This has to be it.  Let's give them a clear and concise response.
