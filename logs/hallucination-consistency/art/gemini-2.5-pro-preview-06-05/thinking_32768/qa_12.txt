Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a specific piece of information: the name of a famous book by Khaled Hosseini published on a specific date. I need to break this down methodically to make sure I get it right.

First, I need to identify the core question: They want the title. Next, I'll extract the key details: Author: Khaled Hosseini. Date: May 29, 2003. And the type is a 'famous book'. That's the target.

Now, let's tap into my knowledge base. I know Khaled Hosseini has written a few well-known novels. I need to quickly recall them. I've got: *The Kite Runner*, *A Thousand Splendid Suns*, *And the Mountains Echoed*, and *Sea Prayer*.

Next step: verify the publication dates. I'll double-check each title against the given date. *The Kite Runner*... ah, I recall it was a huge hit. I’ll verify the date. Okay, May 29, 2003. Perfect! *A Thousand Splendid Suns* was later. *And the Mountains Echoed* and *Sea Prayer* are also later.

So, *The Kite Runner* is the correct match. It's by Hosseini, and the publication date fits perfectly. It was also his debut novel, so it’s definitely a famous one.

Now for the response. I'll be precise and complete. I'll start by directly answering the question. The response should include the title, author, and date. I will also mention that it was his debut novel, to provide some additional context. I need to format it correctly to comply with the user's requests. The final answer goes on a new line at the end.

Okay, drafting the response: "The famous book by Khaled Hosseini that was released on May 29, 2003, is his debut novel, *The Kite Runner*."

Now, one last check. Does it answer the question directly? Yes. Is the information correct? Yes. Does it follow all instructions regarding formatting? Yes. Perfect. Let's get it right.

*The Kite Runner*
