Okay, let's break this down. The user needs the name of a famous book. Easy enough, my area of expertise.

First, I need to extract the key details: author (Thomas Harris), date (June 8, 1999), and the type of item, a "famous book." Got it. Now for the search strategy. I'll need to use my internal database. First, I'll search "Thomas Harris books 1999". That might be too broad. I can also search the specific date, June 8, 1999, combined with the author's name to narrow it down. Or, if I get stuck, I can always consult a Thomas Harris bibliography, checking publication dates.

Right, time to execute the search, mostly in my head, drawing on my existing knowledge. Thomas Harris. The Hannibal Lecter series is his most well-known work, and there are a few books: *Red Dragon*, *The Silence of the Lambs*, *Hannibal*, and *Hannibal Rising*. Let's mentally check those publication dates. *Red Dragon*, I know that's early 80s. *Silence of the Lambs*, definitely before the 1990s. Okay, and *Hannibal*... that one's definitely the right timeframe. *Hannibal Rising* is the prequel, so that came later. Let's verify that *Hannibal* date. Yep, a quick check confirms *Hannibal* was published in 1999. Now, let's confirm the precise date. I'll do a quick search for "Hannibal book release date". Perfect, it's June 8, 1999.

Alright, synthesize the answer. I'll start with a confirming sentence, then the book title, adding a little context, and stick to the formatting rules.

The famous book by Thomas Harris released on June 8, 1999, is...

*Hannibal*, the third book in the Hannibal Lecter series.
