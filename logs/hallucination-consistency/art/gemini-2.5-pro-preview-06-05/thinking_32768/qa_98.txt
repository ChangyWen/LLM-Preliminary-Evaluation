Now, let's see. Author: Michael Crichton, Check. Release Date: September 8, 1995, Check. Famous book? Well, it's the sequel to *Jurassic Park* and a huge bestseller. Absolutely, that fits. I'm ready to answer.

The answer structure is important. I need to be direct but also provide some context. I should mention it's the sequel to *Jurassic Park* to add depth, plus I need to follow the prompt's directions and present my final answer on a new line.
