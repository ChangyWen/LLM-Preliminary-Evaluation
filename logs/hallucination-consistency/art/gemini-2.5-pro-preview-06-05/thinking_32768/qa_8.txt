Okay, let's see... the user wants a book, and specifically a *famous* one. Right, I need to pinpoint the title based on the clues provided. First, I'll grab the key facts: 2001-06-19 and Neil Gaiman. That's my starting point.

My immediate thought is to formulate a search. Something like "Neil Gaiman book released 2001-06-19" would work. Or maybe a simpler approach: "Neil Gaiman bibliography" and filter by the publication year. I'll go with the first strategy, it feels more targeted.

But before I start searching externally, let's see what I can pull from my internal knowledge base. Neil Gaiman, of course. I know his work. Let's see... *Sandman* (the comic series), *Good Omens* (with Pratchett, a classic!), *Stardust*, *Coraline*, *The Graveyard Book*, and *American Gods*. Now, which of those lines up with the date? *Sandman* is way off, *Good Omens* too. *Stardust*... no. *Coraline*... nope. *The Graveyard Book*... after. Ah, *American Gods*! That feels right.

Now, let's confirm that date. Iâ€™ll need to specifically check *American Gods*' release date. "American Gods publication date" should do the trick. Yep, Wikipedia and other sources corroborate that initial US release of June 19, 2001.

Hang on a moment, let's double-check the author's full name. I always appreciate verifying that. "Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman." Okay, seems legit.

Right, synthesizing everything. The book is definitely *American Gods*. Author: Neil Gaiman. Date: June 19, 2001. It fits perfectly. And yes, it's *famous*. It's won awards, and there's a TV show. That's solid proof.

Now for the response. I'll be direct. The user wants the book title on a new line. Here it is:

The famous book by Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman that was released on June 19, 2001, is *American Gods*.

American Gods
