Okay, so the user wants to know the name of a famous book. Got it. Let's see... they've given me the date of April 12, 2005, and the author's name, Stephen Dubner. Hmm, Dubner... that rings a bell. And that date is pretty specific, which is good.

Right away, that "Stephen Dubner" and "2005" combination... *Freakonomics* immediately pops into my head. But I need to confirm. Who was it co-authored with? Ah, yes, Steven Levitt. So Dubner is definitely a "creator," as the user specified. Now, what about that release date? *Freakonomics*... let me just... yep, April 12, 2005. Nailed it.

So, to the user, the answer is *Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything*. And the user wanted it in a specific format. Let's summarize it and make sure we cover all the bases and follow the user's instructions.

The famous book created by Stephen Dubner (along with co-author Steven D. Levitt) and released on April 12, 2005, is *Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything*.
