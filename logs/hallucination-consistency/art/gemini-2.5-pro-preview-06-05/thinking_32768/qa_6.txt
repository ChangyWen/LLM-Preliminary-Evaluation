Okay, so the user is asking for the name of a famous book. My job is to figure out what they want. Let's see, I have the release date, the author, and the fact that it's considered "famous." Alright, first things first, I need to extract those key pieces of information: 2002-02-28, Richard K. Morgan, and "famous."

Now, how do I find it? My search strategy will be crucial. I'll start with the basics: "Richard K. Morgan books," then refine it with "Richard K. Morgan book released 2002," and finally, if needed, I can narrow it down with "Richard K. Morgan 2002-02-28."

Let's tap into my internal knowledge... Richard K. Morgan is a well-known figure in science fiction. Ah, right, he's best known for the Takeshi Kovacs series. And the first book is *Altered Carbon*. I seem to recall that book being released in 2002, so let's confirm that quickly... Yes, a quick search confirms the publication date, February 28, 2002, by Gollancz.

Is *Altered Carbon* actually "famous" though? It did win the Philip K. Dick Award. And there was that popular Netflix series adaptation. Plus, it's a major work in the cyberpunk genre. Absolutely, it fits the bill.

Time to formulate the answer. I'll start with a direct, informative sentence. The user will get the author and the release date too, to fully satisfy their question. So, "The famous book by Richard K. Morgan released on February 28, 2002, is *Altered Carbon*." And then I'll provide the answer as requested on a new line.

Now, I need to format it exactly as the prompt asks. Introductory sentence, a blank line, and then the book title. Okay, I'm happy with it! "The famous book by Richard K. Morgan released on February 28, 2002, is *Altered Carbon*." The response is accurate and complete. Ready to go.

*Altered Carbon*
