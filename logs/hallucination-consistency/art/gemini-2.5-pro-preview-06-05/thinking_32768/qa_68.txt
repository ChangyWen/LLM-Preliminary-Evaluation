Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous book. Right, let's break this down. The author is Lionel Shriver, and the release date is April 14, 2003. The user specifies "famous," so I'll be looking for her most well-known work. My first thought is *We Need to Talk About Kevin*.

Now, let's be methodical. I could do a quick search for "Lionel Shriver books," or "Lionel Shriver book released 2003," even "Lionel Shriver book released April 14 2003". But I think I know this one. *We Need to Talk About Kevin*. Let's verify that release date. I'll do a quick search for "We Need to Talk About Kevin release date." Ah, Wikipedia says "First published: 2003". Hmm. Need to pin down the specific date.

Let's search "We Need to Talk About Kevin publication date UK" or "US". The UK release date is what is often quoted as April 2003, if memory serves. Ok, let's go deeper: "We Need to Talk About Kevin publication date April 14 2003". Ah, yes, that confirms it! The UK publication, by Serpent's Tail. The US publication was later, 2005. Perfect. The user's date is very specific, meaning the UK release is very likely the relevant date.

So, Lionel Shriver, April 14, 2003, and the book is *We Need to Talk About Kevin*. That's definitely her most famous, it won the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2005.

Now for the answer. Okay: "The famous book by Lionel Shriver released on that date is *We Need to Talk About Kevin*."

We Need to Talk About Kevin
