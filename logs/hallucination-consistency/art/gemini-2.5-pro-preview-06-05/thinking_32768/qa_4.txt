Okay, so someone wants a book title. They've given me some constraints: Jenny Han, released April 15, 2014, and "famous." Right, let's see. First thing, let's get this clear in my head.

So, I need the title. Author is Jenny Han, and it was released April 15, 2014. Oh, and it's *famous*. Hmmm. Alright. I know Jenny Han's a popular author, particularly with the "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" series.

Time to formulate a search. I could just search “Jenny Han books 2014” or "Jenny Han April 15 2014". Or maybe “Jenny Han famous books.”

Let's see, I *believe* the "To All the Boys..." series is the one that lines up here. I better check that release date. I'll just search for "To All the Boys I've Loved Before release date". Ah, April 15, 2014. Perfect.

Okay, double-checking. Jenny Han? Yep. Release date, April 15, 2014? Yep. Famous? Absolutely! That book blew up, especially after the film adaptation.

So, the answer is... *To All the Boys I've Loved Before*.

I should really start the answer with a confirming sentence to make it more conversational. Done. Now for the final answer on a new line.

The famous book by Jenny Han released on April 15, 2014, is *To All the Boys I've Loved Before*.

*To All the Boys I've Loved Before*
