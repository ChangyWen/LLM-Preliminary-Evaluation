Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core question is clear: find the name of a famous Robert A. Heinlein book published on June 1, 1961. Right, so, let's break this down. Heinlein... a sci-fi titan. Got it.

I know his big hitters. *Starship Troopers*, *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress*, *Stranger in a Strange Land*, *Friday*, *Glory Road*... that's just off the top of my head. But which one came out in '61?

Time for a quick check. "Robert Heinlein book published 1961"? Or maybe, "Stranger in a Strange Land publication date," because that one feels right. I seem to recall it being a big one.

Yep, *Stranger in a Strange Land* definitely resonates. Alright, let's confirm that date. Quick search... Aha! G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1961. Now to be precise, because these details matter. Wikipedia, the ISFDB, they'll have the exact date. And there it is: June 1, 1961. Perfect.

So, the answer: *Stranger in a Strange Land*. Heinlein. June 1, 1961. Famous. Done. Now, how to phrase this for the user...

The famous book by Robert A. Heinlein that was released on June 1, 1961, is *Stranger in a Strange Land*.

Stranger in a Strange Land
