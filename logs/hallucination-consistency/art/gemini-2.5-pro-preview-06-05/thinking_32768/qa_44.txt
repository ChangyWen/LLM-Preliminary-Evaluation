Okay, let's get this done. First, I need to figure out what the user actually wants. It seems they're asking for a famous book by Michael Crichton, released on November 20, 1990. Alright, that's my core question.

Next, I need to break down what I already know and what I need to find. I have the author, Michael Crichton, and the release date, November 20, 1990. The book is also supposed to be "famous". Okay, so where do I start?

I know a few search strategies that would work. I could search for "Michael Crichton books 1990", or I could go more specific with "Michael Crichton book release date November 20 1990". I could also try finding a list of Crichton's books and checking their publication dates.

Now, I have a lot of information on Crichton books. I know he wrote *Jurassic Park*. Let's see, I *think* it was around that time, let me just verify the publication date. A quick check of my internal knowledge confirms *Jurassic Park* was indeed a November 1990 release, but let's get the exact date. I will search "Jurassic Park book publication date" and see what I find. Ah, November 20, 1990. Perfect.

Okay, so to put it all together: the book is *Jurassic Park*. It was written by Michael Crichton, and released on November 20, 1990. That matches all the criteria.

Now, I need to format the response exactly as requested. First, a quick sentence or two to provide the context and the answer. Then, a blank line, and then the final answer on a new line.

The book is *Jurassic Park*, written by Michael Crichton, which was released on November 20, 1990.
