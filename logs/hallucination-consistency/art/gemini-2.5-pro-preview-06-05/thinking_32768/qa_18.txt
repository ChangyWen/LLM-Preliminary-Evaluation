Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous book. Alright, so I need to extract the important details. The release date is October 18, 2007, the author is Jay Asher, and it's supposed to be "famous." Hmm... that's enough to get started.

My first thought is to formulate a search query - either internal memory or maybe a quick external search. Let's try "Jay Asher book 2007" or perhaps "Jay Asher book released October 18 2007." Yeah, that's the way to go.

Ah, yes, *Thirteen Reasons Why* by Jay Asher. I know that book. And I seem to recall the release date was right around then... Let me just double-check that *Thirteen Reasons Why* was indeed October 18, 2007. Yep, Razorbill, an imprint of Penguin Books. Okay. And is it famous? Definitely. Number one New York Times bestseller, wildly popular Netflix series... Yep, definitely checks that box too.

Now, how to phrase the answer. The user wants it simple and direct. So: the book, the author, the date. And the final answer needs to be on a new line.

I've got it: "The famous book by Jay Asher that was released on October 18, 2007, is *Thirteen Reasons Why*." Perfect. Concise and clear.

*Thirteen Reasons Why*
