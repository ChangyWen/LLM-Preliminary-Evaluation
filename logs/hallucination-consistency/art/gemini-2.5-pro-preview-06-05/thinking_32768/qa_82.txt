Okay, let's get this done. The user needs the name of a famous book by Joël Dicker published on September 19, 2012. Alright, first things first, I know Dicker's most well-known work. Now, let's make sure I get the date right. I need a solid search strategy to confirm this. I can just look for Joël Dicker books, but narrowing it down by year and specific date is better: "Joël Dicker book released 2012-09-19".

My gut tells me it's *The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair*. I'm pretty confident, but I'm a stickler for accuracy, so let's quickly verify the release date. "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair release date" should do the trick. Ah yes, the original French title is *La Vérité sur l'affaire Harry Quebert*. Wikipedia or publisher websites will surely have the original publication date. Checking Wikipedia for the French title confirms it - "Date de parution : 19 septembre 2012". Excellent! That's the exact date the user provided.

Alright, synthesizing the response now. The book is definitely *The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair*. It's a perfect fit for "famous book," considering its critical acclaim and widespread success. Giving both the English and French title makes sense, even though the query is in English. Let's format it to the user's instructions.

The famous book by Joël Dicker released on September 19, 2012, is *The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair* (original French title: *La Vérité sur l'affaire Harry Quebert*).
