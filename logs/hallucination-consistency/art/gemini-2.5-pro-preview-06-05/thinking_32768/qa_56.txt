Okay, let's get this done. First, I need to understand the core of the query: the user needs the title of a famous Agatha Christie novel released on November 3, 1958. Right, got it.

So, I'll break this down. The important things are: Agatha Christie, publication date of November 3, 1958, and it has to be a famous book.  I'll quickly strategize my approach: I'll start by searching for "Agatha Christie books published in 1958" to get a manageable list. Then I can refine that with a more specific search: "Agatha Christie book release date November 3 1958" if the first search doesn't pinpoint it immediately.  I know a good place to look would be Wikipedia, perhaps official Christie sites, or a literary database if I have access to them, and cross-reference the information.

Right, let's think. Agatha Christie...1958... The first book that immediately springs to mind is *Ordeal by Innocence*. Let's verify the date. "Ordeal by Innocence publication date"... hmm, I think that's the one. According to my internal knowledge base - and I could double-check with a quick search of any reliable sources - *Ordeal by Innocence* was, indeed, published on the 3rd of November 1958.

So, synthesize the answer now: The book is *Ordeal by Innocence*. The author is correct. The date fits. It’s a pretty well-known Christie. That's the answer.

Now, how to structure the response… The instructions said to present the final answer on a new line. Simple enough.  So it'll be a confirmatory sentence, followed by the book title on the next line.

Therefore, the answer is: The book by Agatha Christie released on November 3, 1958, is

Ordeal by Innocence
