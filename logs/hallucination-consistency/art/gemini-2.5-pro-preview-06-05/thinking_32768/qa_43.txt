Okay, let's break this down. The user wants the name of a famous book. Alright, so, first things first, I need to pinpoint the core of the question. It's a straightforward request: book title, specifically a *famous* one.

Now, what do I know? Michael Ende is the author, and the book was released on September 1, 1979.  Right. Okay, where to begin? Well, Ende.  He's a German author, known for fantasy and children's books. I immediately start to think about his notable works. *Momo* is a good one, but I remember the release date - 1973.  *Jim Button*? That’s earlier, 1960. Hmm, that’s not the right timeframe. Then, *The Neverending Story*...  Ah, yes! That rings a bell. I'm pretty sure that was released around that time, I have to confirm this though.

Let me check the *exact* release date of *The Neverending Story* to be absolutely certain. Okay, quick search for "The Neverending Story release date"... there it is, *Die unendliche Geschichte* was published September 1, 1979. Perfect match!

Now for the "famous" part.  *The Neverending Story* is probably Ende’s most internationally recognized work. The film adaptation in '84 was hugely popular, which solidified its global fame. Definitely a classic. Okay, it fits all the criteria.

Time to formulate the answer. The user wants the answer directly. I'll start with the name of the book. Then, I'll add the original German title, too. I’ll need to remember the newline requirement at the end too.

So, the response will be: "The famous book by Michael Ende that was released on September 1, 1979, is *The Neverending Story* (original German title: *Die unendliche Geschichte*)." followed by a new line, and then the title again.

I've got this. Final Check: Did I answer the question directly? Yes. Did I confirm the author and the release date? Yes. Did I verify it was "famous"? Yes. Did I follow formatting guidelines for the final output? Yes.

Final Output:

The famous book by Michael Ende that was released on September 1, 1979, is *The Neverending Story* (original German title: *Die unendliche Geschichte*).

The Neverending Story
