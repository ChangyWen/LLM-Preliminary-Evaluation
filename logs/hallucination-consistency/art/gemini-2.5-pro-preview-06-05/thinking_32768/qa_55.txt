Okay, let's break this down. The user wants a specific book by Tom Bissell. The key parameters are: it's a "famous book," it's by Tom Bissell, and it was released on October 10, 2013. Hmm, a precise date. Alright.

First, the simplest approach: "Tom Bissell books 2013." That should yield a decent starting point. Okay, the search results point directly to *The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made*.  Ah, of course, the collaboration with Greg Sestero! Tom Bissell is the co-author, which definitely fits the description. Now, to verify the release date… Let me check... "The Disaster Artist" was published in October 2013 by Simon & Schuster. The date isn't *exactly* October 10th; it looks like October 1st.

That's close enough, though. October 1st versus October 10th... it’s probably a nuance of the publishing schedule, or perhaps the user has the date a little off. Let's see, *Magic Hours* came out in 2012, *Apostle* was in 2016. So, it's almost certainly *The Disaster Artist*. The subject matter – the making of *The Room* – makes it undeniably "famous."

So, to answer the question:

*The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made*
