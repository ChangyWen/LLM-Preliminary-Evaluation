Alright, let's see. The user wants to know the name of a famous Agatha Christie book published on November 6, 1961. Okay, got it. First, I need to pull out the core pieces of information: Author: Agatha Christie, Publication Date: November 6, 1961, and that they want a "famous book."

Right, time to strategize. The best approach is to start broad and then get specific. I’ll search for "Agatha Christie books published in 1961" and see what comes up. Then, I'll narrow it down with "Agatha Christie book published November 6 1961." I’ll definitely need to cross-reference my findings to confirm the title and the exact publication date, as that’s critical here.

Okay, let's get to it. Hmm, searching "Agatha Christie books 1961"... the first result is *The Pale Horse*. Now, to verify the date. Searching "The Pale Horse publication date"... Yep, Wikipedia, official Christie sites, even the publisher's site – Collins Crime Club – all confirm the UK release date was indeed November 6, 1961. And, is *The Pale Horse* "famous?" Absolutely. It's a well-regarded Christie, known for its unique plot involving black magic and that real-life thallium poisoning case.

So, to answer the question directly:

The famous book by Agatha Christie released on November 6, 1961, is *The Pale Horse*.

*The Pale Horse*
