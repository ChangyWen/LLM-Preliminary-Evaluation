Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a specific piece of information: the name of a famous book by Philip Pullman, released on October 10, 2000. Straightforward enough. First, I'll break down the request: Author: Philip Pullman, Release Date: October 10, 2000, Type: Famous book.

Right away, I know Philip Pullman is best known for *His Dark Materials*. Let me quickly run through the books in that trilogy in my head: *The Golden Compass* (or *Northern Lights*), *The Subtle Knife*, and *The Amber Spyglass*. Now, I need to jog my memory about the publication dates to narrow down the search. Hmm, *Northern Lights* was 1995, *The Subtle Knife* was 1997. So, that leaves the 2000 release to be *The Amber Spyglass*.

Hold on, the user's date is super specific: October 10, 2000. I need to confirm that *The Amber Spyglass* aligns with this date. A quick search should do the trick. Let me just type in "The Amber Spyglass release date"... Aha! Wikipedia confirms: "It was published on 10 October 2000". Perfect match.

Now to formulate the answer. I'll start by confirming the book in question is indeed a famous one. I'll explicitly state the book's name and give context about the trilogy it's part of. I have to make sure the answer is clear, accurate, and follows the formatting instructions.

So, the final answer should be something like: The famous book by Philip Pullman that was released on October 10, 2000, is *The Amber Spyglass*. It is the third and final novel in his acclaimed *His Dark Materials* trilogy.

*The Amber Spyglass*
