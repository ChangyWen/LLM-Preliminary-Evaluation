Okay, let's see. The user wants to know the name of a famous George Saunders book released on February 14, 2017. Alright, I can handle this.

First, let's break this down. The key pieces of information are: George Saunders, a specific release date (February 14, 2017), and the fact that the book is "famous." That's my primary cue.

So, where to begin? Well, given my expertise, I know George Saunders is a pretty significant contemporary author. Immediately, a search strategy comes to mind. I could try variations: "George Saunders books 2017," or "George Saunders book released February 14 2017," or even a more direct approach like "George Saunders famous book 2017."

But, instead of a broad search, let's leverage what I *know*. I *know* he's a prominent author. I also *recall* his most famous novel, which won a major literary award. That's the key. I'll quickly mentally check what that book is; it's *Lincoln in the Bardo*. Now to double-check the release date. A quick mental search confirms this.

Alright, let's verify. Author: George Saunders. Check. Release Date: February 14, 2017. Check. And, it's certainly "famous" â€“ it won the 2017 Man Booker Prize. That seals it.

Now, to formulate the answer. I'll start by directly answering the question, giving the book's title. Then, I'll add a bit of context to confirm the "famous" aspect and show that I understood the intent of the question. I need to ensure my formatting is correct, as requested: the book's title on a new line.

So, my answer is: The famous book by George Saunders released on February 14, 2017, is his first full-length novel, *Lincoln in the Bardo*. It went on to win the 2017 Man Booker Prize.

*Lincoln in the Bardo*
