Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the name of a well-known book. Right, let's break this down. I know Michael Lewis is the author, and the key details are the release date, June 17, 2003, and the fact that the book is "famous".

First, I'll need to formulate a good search strategy. I can search for "Michael Lewis books released in 2003." Or maybe I can get even more specific: "Michael Lewis book release date June 17 2003." Then I'll need to make sure whatever I find is actually famous.

Let's tap into my internal knowledge. Michael Lewis... definitely rings a bell. He's written a ton of nonfiction, mostly about finance and sports. *Liar's Poker*, *The Big Short*, *The Blind Side*, and *Moneyball* come to mind as his most famous works. Let me quickly check the publication dates of those... *Liar's Poker* was in the late '80s. *The Big Short* and *The Blind Side* were more recent, definitely not 2003. Ah, *Moneyball*! I think that might be the one.

Okay, let's verify the publication date of *Moneyball*. I'll quickly search "Moneyball Michael Lewis publication date." Bingo! *Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game* was published on June 17, 2003.

Now, let's confirm the "famous" aspect. *Moneyball* was a huge bestseller, and it was adapted into a major motion picture starring Brad Pitt. It revolutionized how people thought about baseball. Clearly, it's very well known.

So, I'll start by directly answering the user's question. Then, I'll add a little context to show I really know my stuff â€“ mentioning the full title and that it's about the Oakland A's and sabermetrics. That should seal the deal.

The famous book by Michael Lewis released on June 17, 2003, is *Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game*.

Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game
