*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's see. The user needs the name of a famous Jodi Picoult book released on April 6, 2004. Right. My first thought is to nail down the core question: find a famous Jodi Picoult book released on a specific date. Simple enough.

Next, I need to extract the crucial information. Author: Jodi Picoult. Release date: 2004-04-06. The key attribute is "famous". Got it.

Now, I'll strategize. Hmm... Where to start? "Jodi Picoult books released in 2004" is the obvious first query. I'm also going to guess *My Sister's Keeper* since that one feels like a strong contender. I might also check a "Jodi Picoult bibliography with release dates" to be sure.

Right, let's run a quick search for "Jodi Picoult books 2004." Ah, there it is: *My Sister's Keeper*. Now, a quick check to confirm the release date with a search for "My Sister's Keeper publication date". Wikipedia, Goodreads, or the publisher's site should do the trick. Let's go with Wikipedia; it's usually reliable. The infobox should have the date. Bingo! "April 6, 2004." Perfect match.

Okay, but is *My Sister's Keeper* actually *famous*? Yes, without a doubt. Bestseller, book club favorite, major film adaptation. The "famous" criterion is satisfied.

Time to construct the answer. Start with a direct and helpful sentence. State the book's name clearly. Mention author and release date to provide all the information, and the end result needs to be on a new line.

So, the response will be: "The famous book by Jodi Picoult that was released on April 6, 2004, is *My Sister's Keeper*." That should do it.

And the answer:

*My Sister's Keeper*
