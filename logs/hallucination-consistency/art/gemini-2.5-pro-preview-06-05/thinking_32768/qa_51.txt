Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous book by Donna Tartt, specifically the one published on September 16, 1992. Right, so I need to isolate the key elements: Donna Tartt, a famous book, and the date, which is quite specific.

First, who's Donna Tartt? Ah, a well-regarded American author. She's got a few notable works. Okay, let's think... *The Secret History*, *The Little Friend*, and *The Goldfinch*. Now, publication dates. *The Secret History*... that feels right, I believe it was around that time. *The Little Friend* was much later, 2002, and *The Goldfinch* even later, in 2013.

So, *The Secret History* is the prime suspect, but I need to confirm that exact date, September 16, 1992. Alright, a quick check. Let's see...searching online for "The Secret History publication date September 16, 1992"... yes! Several sources, including Goodreads and other book databases, list September 16, 1992, as the official US publication date. Excellent. That confirms it. The data is spot on.

So, the answer is clear: Donna Tartt, book published September 16, 1992... it's *The Secret History*. And a very famous book at that.

The Secret History
