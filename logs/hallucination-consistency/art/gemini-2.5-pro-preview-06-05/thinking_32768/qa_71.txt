*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a specific book by Philip Pullman, released on July 22, 1997. Right, so, Pullman... I know he's practically synonymous with *His Dark Materials*. That trilogy is the obvious place to start. Let's see, *The Golden Compass* (or *Northern Lights*, depending where you are), then *The Subtle Knife*, and finally *The Amber Spyglass*. I'll need to nail down those publication dates. I'll do a mental search—or maybe a quick internal database lookup—to double-check the release years. I'm pretty sure *The Golden Compass* came out earlier, maybe '95 or so. Ah, yes, *The Subtle Knife*... That's the one that's likely to fit. I'll cross-reference the year against that specific date, July 22nd, 1997. I'll check Wikipedia, Goodreads, all those reliable sources to be absolutely sure. And then, to be extra safe, I'll verify that the US release date matches. Hmm... okay, the UK release was indeed in 1997. I'm confident now. The date is very specific, so that's definitely the key. The user wants the single book title, so let's get straight to the point.

*The Subtle Knife*
