Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the name of a well-known book. Let's see...I've got to find a famous book by Michael Lewis, published on March 15, 2010.

First, I'll brainstorm a search strategy. I'll try "Michael Lewis books released in 2010," maybe followed by "Michael Lewis book release date March 15 2010." Then I'll cross-reference the results.

Alright, let's see. Immediately, "Michael Lewis books 2010" brings up *The Big Short*. I'll need to confirm the release date, which, is going to be the key. A quick search for "The Big Short release date" should do the trick. Wikipedia's usually good, as are publisher sites. Yes! Wikipedia says "Publication date: March 15, 2010." Amazon also confirms the date. Spot on.

Now, is *The Big Short* actually famous? Absolutely. It was a huge bestseller, critically acclaimed, and even adapted into an Oscar-winning movie. Definitely a cornerstone of Lewis's work alongside *Moneyball*, *The Blind Side*, and *Liar's Poker*. So, "famous" is perfectly accurate.

I need to put the answer together now. I'll start with a direct answer, the book title, and some context to show I know what I'm talking about.

Here's the structure: the answer, a blank line, and the final answer as requested. Okay, here goes:
