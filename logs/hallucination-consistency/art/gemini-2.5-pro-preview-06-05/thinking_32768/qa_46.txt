Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know the title of a famous Haruki Murakami book released on May 29, 2009. Straightforward enough. First, let's break it down.

I need to identify the core question: *Name of a famous Murakami book released on 2009-05-29*. Thatâ€™s the core.

Then, I'll pull out the specifics. Author: Haruki Murakami. Release date: May 29, 2009. The book needs to be famous. Got it.

Now for the strategy. I could start with a broad search, something like "Haruki Murakami books 2009." Or, I could get more specific: "Haruki Murakami book release date 2009-05-29." Another option, considering the timeframe and his popularity, would be to check if it's *1Q84* and then look up the release date.

Let's see... Searching for "Haruki Murakami book release date 2009-05-29" immediately brings up *1Q84*. Hmm, I think I'm remembering correctly, that's the one, and it was a big deal. Let me just confirm with Wikipedia. Yep! The first two volumes were published in Japan on May 29, 2009. Perfect match. And yes, *1Q84* is definitely a famous Murakami book.

So, the answer is *1Q84*. But wait, I should provide a bit more context. The date given was the original Japanese release date for the first two volumes. That adds some helpful specificity.

Right, and the user specifically requested the final answer on a new line. So, the response needs to provide some context first, then, a new line with the answer. Let's see... The format should be *informative sentence*... *blank line*... *book title*.

*The famous book by Haruki Murakami released on May 29, 2009, is* 1Q84*. *This was the original release date in Japan for the first two volumes of the novel.*
