Okay, so the user is asking for the name of a famous book. My first step is to zero in on what I actually know. I see the key pieces: author Deborah Feldman, release date February 14, 2012, and the "famous" attribute. Right away, the name "Unorthodox" pops into my mind. It was a huge hit, wasn't it?

Let's make sure. I need to search my memory, and if that fails, use an external source. I immediately recall that Feldman wrote a memoir about leaving the Hasidic community. That's where my mental database says the book comes from. "Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots." I know the date is important, so I need to check. Let's search for the release date… bingo, February 14th, 2012.

Now, is it truly "famous"? Absolutely. It was a *New York Times* bestseller. More recently, it was adapted into that incredibly successful Netflix miniseries in 2020. So, "famous" is accurate. Excellent.

Now, I need to format this response to follow the user’s request. It should begin with a little context, then a blank line, and finally the title.

The famous book by Deborah Feldman released on February 14, 2012, is her memoir, *Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots*. It details her experience growing up in and eventually leaving the Satmar Hasidic community in Brooklyn, New York. The book was later adapted into a popular Netflix miniseries.
