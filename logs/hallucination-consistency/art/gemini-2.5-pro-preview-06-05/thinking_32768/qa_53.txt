Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a specific answer: the title of a well-known Shirley Jackson book published on September 21, 1962. Right, let's break this down.

First, I need to lock onto the core of the question: identifying a particular book, and I've got the critical details: "Shirley Jackson" and "1962-09-21." My next move is formulating a plan to find that book. My usual approach would be to either run the facts through my mental Rolodex, or check an external source, like Google.

Let's start internally. Shirley Jackson... I immediately think *The Haunting of Hill House* and *We Have Always Lived in the Castle.* *Hill House* rings an older bell, but *We Have Always Lived in the Castle* is her last, so let's go with that. I need to verify the publication date, though. If my memory is failing me, I know a quick search of the internet will get me the final answer I need.

Yes! A quick look confirms it: *We Have Always Lived in the Castle* was published on the correct date. Now I need to check my answer to make sure it has everything the user needs: Author, Publication Date, and it is a well-known book by the author, as the user said. The facts check out.

Now, the writing. First and foremost, I need to give a direct, correct answer with a clear statement of the book title. Then the date has to match the one given. And finally, I'll just put the book title on a new line at the end, as requested.

*The famous book by Shirley Jackson that was released on September 21, 1962, is *We Have Always Lived in the Castle*.*

We Have Always Lived in the Castle
