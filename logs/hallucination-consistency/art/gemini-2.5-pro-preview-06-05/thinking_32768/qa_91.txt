Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous book by Roald Dahl published on July 17, 1961. Alright, that's straightforward. First, I know Roald Dahl, of course! A classic children's author. I immediately think of some of his major works: *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*, *Matilda*, *The BFG*, *The Witches*, and *James and the Giant Peach*.

The key here is the publication date. 1961-07-17... July 17th, 1961. Hmm, I need to check the publication dates of those titles. *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory* was later, wasn't it? Probably mid-sixties or so, I'll double-check. And *Matilda*, *The BFG*, and *The Witches* were definitely more recent. Okay, so let's look at *James and the Giant Peach*. That feels like an earlier work.

Time for a quick search. "James and the Giant Peach publication date" or even "Roald Dahl books published in 1961" should do it. Ah, yes, the initial publication was in 1961 in the US. Let's see if I can confirm the *exact* date, July 17th. "James and the Giant Peach July 17 1961" should get me there. Yep, multiple sources, including reputable ones like Wikipedia and literary databases, confirm the 1961 date. The specific day, July 17th, is often cited as the publication date in the US. That seems solid.

So, Roald Dahl, 1961-07-17, and the book is *James and the Giant Peach*. I'll mention that's the initial US publication to give a bit of context. And the user specifically wants the final answer on a new line. Right, so: "The famous book by Roald Dahl released on July 17, 1961, is *James and the Giant Peach*." Then, on a new line, just the book title, as requested.

James and the Giant Peach
