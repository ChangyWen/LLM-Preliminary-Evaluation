Alright, let's see. The user needs a book title. The key details are: the author is Jenny Han, it was released on May 2, 2017, and it's "famous". Okay, I know Jenny Han's work pretty well, especially her most popular series. My strategy will be straightforward. I'll immediately think about the "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" series because that's what she's best known for. I should just be able to recall the publication dates, and one of them *should* be the one. Let's see... The first one was in 2014, the second in 2015... ah yes, the third book, *Always and Forever, Lara Jean*, that was in 2017, wasn't it? I can recall the books' contents too, so I'll just verify that May 2, 2017 is correct. Yep, quick fact-check confirms it. Excellent. Okay, time to synthesize the answer. The final response needs to state the book title first and foremost. I'll add a little context to ensure the user knows why I consider this book famous, so I'll mention it's the final book in the series. And of course, I'll state the author and the release date. And finally, I'll stick the title on a new line, because that's what was requested. That seems about right. Let's make it happen.

The famous book by Jenny Han released on May 2, 2017, is *Always and Forever, Lara Jean*. It is the third and final novel in the popular "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" series.

Always and Forever, Lara Jean
