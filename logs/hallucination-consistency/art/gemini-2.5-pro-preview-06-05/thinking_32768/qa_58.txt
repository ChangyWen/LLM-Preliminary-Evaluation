Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the name of a famous book, and they've given me some clues: the author is Emma Donoghue, and it was released around August 6, 2010.

First, I'll need to jog my memory. Emma Donoghueâ€¦ right, she's a well-known author. Let me think about the most famous book she wrote. *Room*! Yes, that's definitely her most famous work. Now, when was *Room* actually published? I seem to remember it was around 2010. Let me double-check that date. Ah, yes. The UK/Ireland release was actually on August 4th, 2010 and the Canadian publication was August 13th, 2010. The US edition was published on September 13, 2010. So, August 6th falls right in that timeframe, making it even more likely that's the book they're after.

Now, just to be certain, let's verify everything. Emma Donoghue? Check. Release date in August 2010? Check, with their given date falling in that range. And is *Room* famous? Absolutely! It was a massive bestseller, was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, and was turned into an award-winning film. It's definitely *the* famous book.

So, to answer the question directly and give some helpful context, I'll say: The famous book by Emma Donoghue released around that time is *Room*.
