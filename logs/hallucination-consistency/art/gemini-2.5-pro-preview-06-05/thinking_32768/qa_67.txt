Okay, let's see. The user needs the title of a book. Right, I get it. It seems they already know the author and the approximate release date. Let's see… Paul Kalanithi, 2016… A famous book, they say.

Right, right. Paul Kalanithi. He's the neurosurgeon, of course. I immediately think of his memoir, a deeply moving piece. Now, the date… 2016, was it? I should have that in my internal database, but just to be absolutely certain, let's double-check that release date. I'll do a quick search, just to be absolutely sure. Yes, that's right, posthumous release on January 12th, 2016.

Okay, so, famous book, Paul Kalanithi, released January 12, 2016... That has to be *When Breath Becomes Air*. It's the only book I know of by him, and the timing is perfect.

The famous book by Paul Kalanithi released on January 12, 2016, is titled *When Breath Becomes Air*.

When Breath Becomes Air
