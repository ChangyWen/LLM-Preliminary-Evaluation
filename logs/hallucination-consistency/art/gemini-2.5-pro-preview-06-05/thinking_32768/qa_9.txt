*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a specific piece of information: the name of a famous book by Jordan Peterson that was released on January 16, 2018. My job is to find that book and give the user the answer.

First, I need to break down the request. I've got an author (Jordan Peterson), a specific date (January 16, 2018), and the type of information needed (a famous book).

Next, I'll consult my internal knowledge base, or rather, I'll perform a quick search. "Jordan Peterson book 2018-01-16" should do it. Then I need to verify what comes up. Did Jordan Peterson actually *have* a famous book? Absolutely. And did he release something significant in 2018? Aha, *12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos* springs to mind. I need to confirm the release date. A quick search confirms the North American release date as January 16, 2018 â€“ perfect!

Now, to formulate the answer. I'll start by directly stating the name of the book, and then reiterate the author and the release date to provide context and confirm I've addressed the query completely. And finally, I have to incorporate the formatting request. They want the final answer on a new line.

So, I'll construct the response: "The famous book by Jordan Peterson that was released on January 16, 2018, is titled *12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos*." And then, because of the explicit instruction, I add a newline and the final answer.

Before sending it off, I need to double-check myself. Does this actually answer the question accurately? Yes. Does it satisfy the formatting requirement? Yes. Okay, I'm ready.

*12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos*
