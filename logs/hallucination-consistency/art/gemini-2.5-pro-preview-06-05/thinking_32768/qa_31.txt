Okay, so the task is to identify a famous book by Jon Krakauer released on January 13, 1996. Right. Jon Krakauer, I know his work well. Let's see, his big hits are *Into the Wild*, *Into Thin Air*, *Under the Banner of Heaven*, *Where Men Win Glory*, and *Missoula*. The specific date is the key here. January 13, 1996... Hmm. *Into the Wild* is definitely the most likely. It's about Christopher McCandless. I recall that it was published around that time. *Into Thin Air* was about the Everest disaster, so that came out later, in '97, I think. *Under the Banner of Heaven*? Nope, that was in the early 2000s. And the others were even later. I'm pretty sure *Into the Wild* came out in January of '96. Let's do a quick search to verify the exact date... Ah, January 1996. The specific day might be a little tricky to pin down precisely â€“ publishers can vary. But January 1996 is the timeframe, and it's definitely the most famous one. *Into Thin Air* was '97, and the others even later. Okay. Given the question and the timeframe, the answer *has* to be *Into the Wild*.

*Into the Wild*, about Christopher McCandless.
