Okay, let's see. The user wants to know the name of a famous book, right? Got it. First, I need to grab the key details: author and release date. Alright, Christopher Paolini, August 26, 2003. Noted. Now, to my knowledge base... right, Christopher Paolini. He's most known for, let me thinkâ€¦ Ah, yes, the *Inheritance Cycle*! Now, which one was released around that time? Ah, *Eragon*, the first book. Let's check the publication details. Yep, self-published in 2002, then picked up by Knopf and released... aha! August 26, 2003. Perfect match! And it was *Eragon*, the first book, that really launched his career. A massive hit. Absolutely. Right. Time to formulate the answer. Just the book title first, then the extra context. The author and the release date to show how it all fits together. Everything checks out. Formatting is easy, just the book title on its own line at the end. Let me run through the plan one last time... question, constraints, answer format... all good. Okay. Here we go...

The book is *Eragon*, the first novel in the *Inheritance Cycle* series by Christopher Paolini. The release date was August 26, 2003.

*Eragon*
