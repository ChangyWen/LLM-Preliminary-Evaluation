Okay, let's see. The user wants to know the name of a famous Stephen King book released on June 8, 1987. Right, so I need to pull up my mental library, or, well, maybe a quick search is the best approach.

First, I'll extract the core facts: Author is Stephen King, date is June 8, 1987, and it's a "famous book". Got it.

I could try "Stephen King book released June 8 1987," or perhaps a more targeted approach, like checking his 1987 bibliography. Or, I have a hunch... *Misery*? That feels right. Also, I should check the release date of *The Eyes of the Dragon*.

A quick search... Yep, there it is. King had two big novels that year. *The Eyes of the Dragon*, published in mass market edition on Feb 2, 1987. And *Misery*... ah, there it is - published on June 8, 1987! Perfect. The date and author match exactly. And *Misery* *is* certainly famous, adapted into a classic film, and a cornerstone of King's oeuvre.

Now, to construct the answer. Direct and clear, just the book title, with a bit of context. I'll mention its genre. And then... adhere to the formatting instructions. Okay, all set. I need to state the name of the book and then place the final answer on a new line at the end, after my initial thoughts and answer.

The famous book by Stephen King that was released on June 8, 1987, is the psychological horror novel *Misery*.

Misery
