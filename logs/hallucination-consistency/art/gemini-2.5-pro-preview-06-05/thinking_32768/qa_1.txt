Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous Stephen King book released on September 15, 1986. Right. My first thought is to break this down: Author is Stephen King, the date is the key, and the type is a "famous book". Hmm… September 15, 1986… that's pretty specific. My mind immediately starts racing through King's major works, especially those from the 80s. I'm thinking *It*, *The Stand*, maybe *Misery*?

First, I'll cross-reference the date with my internal library. "Stephen King books 1986," I think. Okay, let's quickly confirm the release date of *It*. Aha! "First published: September 15, 1986." Nailed it. Now, is *It* famous? Absolutely! Pennywise the Clown, the miniseries, the films… it's definitely iconic. It meets all the criteria. So, the final answer is…

The famous book by Stephen King released on September 15, 1986, is *It*.
