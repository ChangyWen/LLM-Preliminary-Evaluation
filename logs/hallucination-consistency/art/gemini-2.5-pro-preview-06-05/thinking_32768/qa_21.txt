Okay, so someone's asking about a specific John Steinbeck book from a specific date. My immediate thought is to break this down. First, what's the core of the question? Right, they want the name of a Steinbeck book published on September 19, 1952.

Next, let's pull out the key info: John Steinbeck, a famous book, and the date September 19, 1952. I'll need to form a quick search strategy. Let's see… I could search for Steinbeck's books published in 1952, but that might be too broad. I could try "John Steinbeck East of Eden publication date," since I *think* that's a contender, or maybe "famous John Steinbeck book 1952" – that's likely to get me the answer quickly.

Now, let's access my internal database. Steinbeck... *The Grapes of Wrath*, *Of Mice and Men*, *East of Eden*, *The Pearl*... I know *Grapes of Wrath* was way earlier, in the 30s, and so was *Of Mice and Men*. *East of Eden* feels right, right? And it's a big novel, so it's a likely candidate for “famous.” Okay, let’s double-check that publication date. A quick mental search… ah, yes, *East of Eden* was published in the 1950s, so let's verify the date.

Okay, I'm almost there. Based on the date, and my knowledge, it's almost certainly *East of Eden*. The author's Steinbeck, and the date matches perfectly – September 19, 1952. And it *is* one of his most important works.

Time to construct the answer. I need to be direct, get right to the point. The name of the book, and then I can flesh it out a bit with some extra context. Perfect. And, the final answer has to be on a separate line.

Therefore:

The famous book by John Steinbeck that was released on September 19, 1952, is *East of Eden*.
This epic novel is often regarded as Steinbeck's most ambitious work.

*East of Eden*
