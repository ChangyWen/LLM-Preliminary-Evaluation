*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a specific piece of information: the name of a famous Roald Dahl book published on January 17, 1964. Alright, let's break this down. I need to find a Roald Dahl book... *specifically* one published on that particular date.

First, I'll start with "Roald Dahl books." My memory already knows he wrote some very well-known children's books. Then I'll narrow it down by searching for "Roald Dahl books published in 1964." And finally, I'll be *really* specific, searching for "Roald Dahl book published January 17, 1964."

My mind immediately conjures *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*. That's the one! I'll quickly double-check the date though, just to be absolutely certain. A quick scan of my internal and external databases confirms it. It was indeed published in the US on January 17, 1964. The UK release was later, but the date provided matches the US publication.

So, let's put this all together. The answer has to be clear, and I need to provide it on a separate line. I'll start by saying, "The famous book by Roald Dahl released on January 17, 1964, is *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*."

Then, to format as required...

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
