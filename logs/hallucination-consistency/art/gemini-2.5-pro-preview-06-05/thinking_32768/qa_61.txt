Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to figure out exactly what the user wants – they're asking for a book title, I get that.

Next, let's pull out the key data points: Suzanne Collins, August 24, 2010, and that it's a famous book. Right. Now, I'll tap into my knowledge of Suzanne Collins and her work. She's basically synonymous with *The Hunger Games*. Okay, let's quickly recall the release dates for those books. Hmm... I remember the main trilogy. *The Hunger Games* came first, in 2008. Then *Catching Fire* in 2009. Ah, and *Mockingjay* – that's the one I'm thinking of – released on August 24, 2010! And the prequel, *The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes*, released in 2020.

Now to verify. Collins? Check. August 24, 2010? *Mockingjay*! The date is the key. And "famous"? Absolutely, it's the finale.

Alright, the response: I'll directly answer the question with the book title. I'll add a quick context of the trilogy just to be helpful. And, most importantly, I'll follow the instructions and put the final answer on a new line.

So, here it is: "The famous book by Suzanne Collins released on August 24, 2010, is *Mockingjay*. It is the third and final book in the original *Hunger Games* trilogy."

And, now, for the final piece, the new line, which is:

*Mockingjay*
