Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the name of a famous Patricia Highsmith book published on November 30, 1955. Right, that's a specific date. My initial approach is going to be straightforward: I need to identify the author, the date, and the context â€“ "famous book". Highsmith... hmm, Ripley. That immediately pops to mind. I need to confirm the details.

I know Highsmith and I know Ripley. I seem to recall *The Talented Mr. Ripley* was the first, so that's a good starting point. Time to mentally check the date. Okay, I can either look at a mental bibliography or do a quick online search just to confirm. Searching "The Talented Mr. Ripley publication date" quickly. Yes, November 30, 1955. Perfect. Highsmith, November 30, 1955, and *The Talented Mr. Ripley*. That's it. Now to the answer. It's definitely her most well-known work, especially considering the adaptations. I'll keep it concise. "The famous book by Patricia Highsmith that was released on November 30, 1955, is *The Talented Mr. Ripley*." And then, as requested:

The Talented Mr. Ripley
