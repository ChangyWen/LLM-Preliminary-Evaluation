I'll start with a quick search strategy: "Jenny Han books released in 2015." That should narrow it down. Or, I could search directly with "Jenny Han book release date May 26 2015". Okay, time to execute.

Wait! I know! Jenny Han is known for the "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" series! Let's check those dates. Book one was April 15, 2014, so not it. Let me think... wait... *P.S. I Still Love You*! That was it, and the date? May 26, 2015! YES!

Now to formulate the answer. I'll directly answer the question first. Then I'll add some context about it being the second book in the series to cement the "famous" attribute.

Okay, the answer is: *P.S. I Still Love You*. And it’s a perfect fit for the request.

I’ll make sure the formatting is correct and deliver the final, requested answer on a new line. Ready!
