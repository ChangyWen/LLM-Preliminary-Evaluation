Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a book title. Right, I need to zero in on what they actually want.

First, I'll need to extract the crucial details. Okay, it looks like I have the author's name, Pierce Brown, and the release date, January 28, 2014.

Now, I can use this information. I could try "book by Pierce Brown released 2014-01-28" or something like "Pierce Brown first book release date," though, given my familiarity, I think I can just *recall* the information. I know Pierce Brown is the author of the *Red Rising* series, and I'm pretty sure the first book is self-titled *Red Rising*.

I need to check the publication date of the first book. A quick check confirms that *Red Rising* was, in fact, published on January 28, 2014.

Synthesizing, the author is Pierce Brown, the date is spot on, and the book they're asking about is *Red Rising*.

I can simply state the answer, and remember the blank line and the answer is on the next line, as requested. The response should be clear and straightforward.

The famous book by Pierce Brown that was released on January 28, 2014, is *Red Rising*.
