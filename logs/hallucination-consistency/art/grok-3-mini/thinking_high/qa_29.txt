*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book. The details given are: released on 2017-05-23 and created by Kevin Kwan.

I need to recall or know about Kevin Kwan. He's the author of the "Crazy Rich Asians" series. The first book in that series is "Crazy Rich Asians," which was published in 2013. But the date given is 2017-05-23, so it might not be the first one.

Let me think about Kevin Kwan's books. After "Crazy Rich Asians" in 2013, he wrote "China Rich Girlfriend" in 2015, and then "Rich People Problems" in 2017. I believe "Rich People Problems" was released in 2017.

Confirming the date: 2017-05-23. That sounds familiar. I think "Rich People Problems" was indeed published on May 23, 2017.

Is it famous? Yes, it's part of the popular trilogy that includes "Crazy Rich Asians," which was adapted into a successful movie. So, "Rich People Problems" is well-known.

The user specified "famous book," and given the context, it should be "Rich People Problems."

Now, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start by confirming the details and then state the answer.

Final answer should be just the book name on a new line.

So, to summarize:

- Book: Rich People Problems

- Author: Kevin Kwan

- Release date: May 23, 2017

That matches.
