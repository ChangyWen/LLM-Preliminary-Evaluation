*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1953-04-13, created by Ian Fleming.

I know that Ian Fleming is the author of the James Bond series. The first James Bond book is "Casino Royale."

Now, I need to confirm the release date. I recall that "Casino Royale" was published in 1953. Let me make sure about the exact date. The user specified 1953-04-13, which is April 13, 1953.

From my knowledge, "Casino Royale" was indeed published in April 1953. I think it was on April 13, 1953, in the UK. That matches the date given.

The user says "famous book," and "Casino Royale" is certainly famous as it's the first in the James Bond series.

Ian Fleming's other works are mostly James Bond novels, and the first one is "Casino Royale." Subsequent books came later, so 1953 should be "Casino Royale."

Just to double-check, Ian Fleming's bibliography: "Casino Royale" (1953), "Live and Let Die" (1954), and so on. Yes, 1953 is definitely "Casino Royale."

The user asks for the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, but keep it concise.

Final answer should be just the book name on a new line.

So, the book is "Casino Royale."
