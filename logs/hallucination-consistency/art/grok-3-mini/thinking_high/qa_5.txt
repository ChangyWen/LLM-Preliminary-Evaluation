*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Stephen King that was released on October 3, 1978. I need to recall Stephen King's bibliography and find which book was published on that exact date.

Stephen King is a prolific author, and one of his most famous books is "The Shining." I think "The Shining" was published in 1977, not 1978. Let me double-check that.

I recall that "The Shining" was indeed published in 1977. So, what book did Stephen King release in 1978?

I think "The Stand" was published in 1978. But was it on October 3? I'm not sure about the exact date.

The user specified the date: 1978-10-03, which is October 3, 1978. I need to confirm if there's a book by Stephen King released on that exact date.

From my knowledge, Stephen King's book "The Stand" was first published in 1978. Let me verify the exact publication date.

Upon thinking, I believe "The Stand" was published on October 3, 1978. Yes, that sounds familiar. It's one of his most famous works, often considered a masterpiece.

Other books by King around that time: "Carrie" was 1974, "Salem's Lot" in 1975, "The Shining" in 1977, and then "The Stand" in 1978. That sequence makes sense.

Now, to confirm the exact date: I think October 3, 1978, is indeed the publication date for "The Stand." I should make sure there isn't another book.

Stephen King also wrote "Night Shift," which is a collection of short stories, published in 1978. But I think "Night Shift" was published later in 1978 or possibly in a different month. I'm not sure.

Upon second thought, "The Stand" is the one that's famously associated with 1978, and I believe the date matches.

The user said "famous book," and "The Stand" is indeed very famous. It's been adapted into movies and miniseries.

So, my final answer should be "The Stand."

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

I should keep my response clear and not verbose, as per the instruction. So, I'll just confirm the information and then state the answer.

Response structure:
- Acknowledge the query.
- State the book name.
- End with the answer on a new line.

Finally, box the answer as per the format. Wait, no, the user didn't specify boxing, but in the context of this exercise, I think I need to provide the answer clearly.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I'll do that.
