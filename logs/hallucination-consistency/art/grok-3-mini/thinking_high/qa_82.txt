*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2012-09-19 and created by Joël Dicker. I need to recall or know about Joël Dicker's books.

Joël Dicker is a Swiss author, and one of his most famous books is "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair." I think that book was published around that time. Let me confirm the release date.

From my knowledge, "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair" was first published in French in 2012. I believe the exact date is September 19, 2012. That matches the date given: 2012-09-19.

Is this book famous? Yes, it became a bestseller and was translated into many languages. It won several awards and was adapted into a TV series.

Are there other books by Joël Dicker released around that time? His debut novel was this one, I think. "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair" is his breakthrough novel, published in 2012.

The user specified the date 2012-09-19, which is likely the release date for the French version, as Dicker is Swiss and writes in French.

Now, the user asks for the name of the book and to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be straightforward: I can confirm the book and then state it clearly at the end.

Final answer should be: The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair

But I should make sure about the title. In English, it's "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair," but originally in French, it's "La Vérité sur l'Affaire Harry Quebert." Since the user is asking in English, I'll provide the English title, as it's more commonly known internationally.

The user didn't specify the language, but the date matches the French release, and the book is famous in English too.

To be precise, I can just state the title as it's commonly known.

Structure my response: I should answer directly, perhaps with a bit of context, but keep it concise, and end with the answer on a new line.

Response outline:

- Acknowledge the query.

- Confirm the book details.

- End with the answer.

Final answer: The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair

Make sure the date is correct. Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, it was released on September 19, 2012, in France.

I think that's accurate.
