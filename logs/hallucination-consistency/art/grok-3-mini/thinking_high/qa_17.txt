*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on January 17, 1964, created by Roald Dahl. I need to recall if I know any books by Roald Dahl from that time.

Roald Dahl is a famous author known for children's books like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, and Matilda. I need to check the release date of these books.

I think Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was published in 1964. Let me confirm the exact date. The user specified January 17, 1964. Is that the exact release date for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?

Upon thinking, I recall that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was first published in the United States in 1964. But is the date exactly January 17? I'm not entirely sure. I should verify this.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll assume that based on common knowledge, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the most famous book by Roald Dahl from 1964. Let me think about other books he wrote around that time.

Roald Dahl's bibliography: James and the Giant Peach was published in 1961, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in 1964, and then The Magic Finger in 1966. So, 1964 points to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

Now, the specific date: January 17, 1964. I need to confirm if that's accurate. In reality, I know that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was published in the US on January 17, 1964, by Alfred A. Knopf. Yes, that sounds right.

The user said "released in 1964-01-17", which is a date format, so it's specifying the exact date. And Roald Dahl is the author.

Is there any other book by Roald Dahl released on that exact date? Probably not, as books are often released on specific dates, but Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the one that matches.

The user asks for the name of the book and to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be concise, and end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer should be: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

To be precise, let me make sure. Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, it was published on January 17, 1964, in the United States.

Also, it's famous, which it is.

So, I think that's the answer.
