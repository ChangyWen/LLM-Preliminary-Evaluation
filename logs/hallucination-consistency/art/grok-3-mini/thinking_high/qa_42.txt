*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 1, 1979, created by Michael Ende.

I need to recall who Michael Ende is. He's a German writer, famous for fantasy books. His most well-known work is "The Neverending Story," which I believe was published in 1979.

Let me confirm the date. The user specified 1979-09-01, which is September 1, 1979. I think "The Neverending Story" was indeed published in 1979, but I should verify if it's exactly on that date. Upon thinking, I recall that the original German version, titled "Die unendliche Geschichte," was published in 1979. I'm not sure about the exact day, but it's often cited as 1979, and the user might be referring to that.

Is there any other famous book by Michael Ende released on that exact date? I don't think so. His other works include "Momo," which was published in 1973, so that's earlier. "The Neverending Story" is his most famous one from 1979.

The user said "created by Michael Ende," and "released in 1979-09-01." I should confirm if September 1 is the exact release date. From my knowledge, "Die unendliche Geschichte" was published in Germany in 1979, and it's commonly accepted as that year. The specific date might not be crucial, but since the user specified it, perhaps that's the date.

Now, the book is famous, and "The Neverending Story" fits that description. It was adapted into movies and is widely known.

The user asks for the answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

Finally, I should give the answer as "The Neverending Story," but since the original is in German, and the user might expect the English title, but the question didn't specify language. However, Michael Ende is German, and the book is often referred to by its English title in international contexts. To be precise, the original title is "Die unendliche Geschichte."

Looking back at the question: "famous book," and it's likely they mean the English title or the common name. But to be accurate, I should probably use the title as it's known.

Upon second thought, the user said "created by Michael Ende," and the date is given, so I'll go with "The Neverending Story."

Let me outline my response:

- I can start by acknowledging the query.

- Then, provide the answer directly at the end in a new line.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I should have some response text, and then the answer on a new line.

For example:

"I believe the famous book you're referring to is The Neverending Story. It was indeed released in 1979 and is one of Michael Ende's most celebrated works.

Final answer:
The Neverending Story"

But to be precise, the original title is "Die unendliche Geschichte," and it was published in German. However, in English-speaking contexts, it's known as "The Neverending Story."

I think for this purpose, "The Neverending Story" is acceptable.

Confirming the date: Upon quick mental search, I recall that "Die unendliche Geschichte" was first published on September 1, 1979, in Germany. Yes, that matches the user's date.

So, I'm confident with this.
