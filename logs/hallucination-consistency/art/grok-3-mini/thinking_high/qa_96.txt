*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book. The book was released on 2001-04-26, which is April 26, 2001, and it was created by Eoin Colfer.

I need to recall who Eoin Colfer is. He's an Irish author, best known for his Artemis Fowl series. Artemis Fowl is a popular young adult fantasy series.

Now, the release date is April 26, 2001. I should check when the first Artemis Fowl book was published. I believe the first book in the series, "Artemis Fowl," was published in 2001. Let me confirm the exact date.

Upon thinking, I recall that "Artemis Fowl" by Eoin Colfer was indeed published in 2001. I think the UK release was in April 2001, and it might match the date given.

The user specified the date as 2001-04-26, which is April 26, 2001. I need to verify if that's the exact release date for "Artemis Fowl."

From my knowledge, "Artemis Fowl" was first published in the UK on April 12, 2001, and in the US on May 8, 2001. That doesn't match April 26. Maybe I'm wrong.

Perhaps it's not the first book. Let me think about other books by Eoin Colfer. The Artemis Fowl series started in 2001, and subsequent books came later. For example, the second book, "Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident," was published in 2002.

The date given is 2001-04-26. Maybe it's the release date in a specific region. Perhaps it's a different book.

I think "Artemis Fowl" is the most famous book by Eoin Colfer, and it's from 2001. Maybe the date is approximate or I'm misremembering.

Perhaps the user meant 2001-04-26 as the date, and I need to confirm. Upon second thought, I believe "Artemis Fowl" was released on April 26, 2001, in some editions or regions. I should assume that's the case since the user specified it.

The user says "famous book," and "created by Eoin Colfer," with that specific date. So, likely, it's "Artemis Fowl."

To be precise, let me think if there's any other book. Eoin Colfer has written other books, but Artemis Fowl is his breakout hit.

Perhaps it's the first book in the series. Yes, I think that's it.

So, the book is "Artemis Fowl."

Now, the user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should lead to that, and then on a new line, say the name.

Finally, answer: Artemis Fowl
