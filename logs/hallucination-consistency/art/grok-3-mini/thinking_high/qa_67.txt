*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book. The details given are: released on 2016-01-12, created by Paul Kalanithi.

I need to recall or know about Paul Kalanithi. I remember that Paul Kalanithi was a neurosurgeon and writer who wrote a memoir about his experiences with terminal illness. The book is called "When Breath Becomes Air."

Now, let me confirm the release date. The user specified 2016-01-12, which is January 12, 2016. I believe "When Breath Becomes Air" was indeed published in 2016. I think it was released posthumously since Paul Kalanithi passed away in 2015. Upon quick recall, yes, the book was published on January 12, 2016.

Is this book famous? Absolutely, it became a bestseller and is widely acclaimed for its poignant reflection on life, death, and medicine.

The user asked for the name of the book, and to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be straightforward: I can provide a bit of context if needed, but since the instruction is to reason step by step and then give the answer, I'll keep it concise.

Final answer should be: When Breath Becomes Air

Make sure the date is correct. 2016-01-12 is January 12, 2016, and yes, that's the release date for "When Breath Becomes Air."

I don't think Paul Kalanithi wrote any other famous books, as this was his only published work, released after his death.

So, I'm confident with this.
