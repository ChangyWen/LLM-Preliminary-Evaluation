*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 14, 2004, created by Lionel Shriver. The date given is 2003-04-14, but that might be a typo because 2003-04-14 is April 14, 2003. However, the user wrote "2003-04-14" but then said "released in 2003-04-14", and in the question, it's "released in 2003-04-14". Looking back: "released in 2003-04-14". But in the text, it's written as "2003-04-14", which is April 14, 2003. But the user might have meant 2004, or it could be a mistake. No, the user said "2003-04-14", but in the question, it's clearly "2003-04-14". Let me read it again: "released in 2003-04-14". Okay, so it's April 14, 2003.

But I know that Lionel Shriver's famous book "We Need to Talk About Kevin" was published in 2003. I think it was released on April 14, 2003. Let me confirm that in my knowledge.

From my knowledge, "We Need to Talk About Kevin" by Lionel Shriver was indeed published in 2003. I believe the exact date is April 14, 2003. Yes, that sounds familiar.

The user said "2003-04-14", which is April 14, 2003, and "created by Lionel Shriver". So, the book is "We Need to Talk About Kevin".

Is there any other famous book by Lionel Shriver released on that date? I don't think so. "We Need to Talk About Kevin" is her most famous work, and it won the Orange Prize in 2005.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be straightforward, and end with the book name on a new line.

Also, the user said "2003-04-14", but in the question, it's written as "2003-04-14", which might be interpreted as April 14, 2003. But just to be precise, in some notations, it could be confused, but it's standard YYYY-MM-DD, so 2003-04-14 is April 14, 2003.

I recall that "We Need to Talk About Kevin" was published in the UK in 2003, and the date might be April 14. Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, it's correct.

So, the answer should be "We Need to Talk About Kevin".

Finally, structure the response: I can say something like, "The famous book released on April 14, 2003, by Lionel Shriver is We Need to Talk About Kevin." Then, on a new line, put the answer.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, perhaps I should have some explanation or just directly answer, but to make it natural, I can have a short response.

Since this is an AI response, I should be helpful and confirm.

But to keep it concise: "The book you are referring to is We Need to Talk About Kevin."

Then, on a new line: We Need to Talk About Kevin

Or perhaps just state it.

Final answer on a new line.
