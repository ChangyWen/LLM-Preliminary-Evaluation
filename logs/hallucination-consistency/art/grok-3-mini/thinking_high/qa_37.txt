*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Stephen King that was released on June 8, 1987. I need to recall or know which book that is.

Stephen King is a famous author, and he has written many books. I need to think about his bibliography and see if there's a book released on that specific date.

I remember that Stephen King wrote "Misery," which was published in 1987. Let me confirm the exact date. I think "Misery" was indeed released in 1987, but I need to verify the date.

Upon thinking, I recall that "Misery" was published on June 8, 1987. That sounds familiar. It's one of his most famous works, adapted into a film starring Kathy Bates.

To be thorough, I should consider if there are any other books by Stephen King released in 1987. I know he wrote "The Eyes of the Dragon" in 1987 as well, but that was published earlier in the year, I think in February. And "Misery" is the one specifically tied to June 8.

The user specified "famous book," and "Misery" is certainly famous, having won awards and been adapted into a successful movie.

Now, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly. I should probably not just blurt out the answer but provide a bit of context or confirmation, but since the instruction is to reason step by step, I'll do that in my thought process, and then give a clean response.

Finally, the answer should be just the name of the book on a new line.

So, my response should end with:

Misery

But to make it clear, I'll write a short response leading up to it.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I can have some text before it, and then the answer.

For example: "After checking, the famous book by Stephen King released on June 8, 1987, is Misery.

Misery"

But perhaps I should keep it concise.

Since this is an AI response, I can be helpful and confirm.

But to stick to the instruction, I'll provide the answer as specified.
