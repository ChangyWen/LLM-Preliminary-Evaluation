*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2009-04-30 and created by Hilary Mantel. I need to recall or know about Hilary Mantel's works.

Hilary Mantel is a well-known author, famous for her historical fiction, particularly the Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell. I think one of her books was released around that time.

The date given is 2009-04-30, which is April 30, 2009. I need to confirm if that's the release date of one of her books.

From my knowledge, Hilary Mantel's book "Wolf Hall" was published in 2009. I believe it was released in the UK on April 30, 2009. Yes, that sounds right. "Wolf Hall" won the Man Booker Prize in 2009, which made it very famous.

I should double-check if there's any other book by Hilary Mantel released on that exact date. Her other major works include "Bring Up the Bodies" (2012) and "The Mirror and the Light" (2020), so 2009 is specifically for "Wolf Hall."

The user specified "famous book," and "Wolf Hall" is indeed famous, having won several awards.

Now, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start by confirming the details and then state the answer.

Final answer should be just the book name on a new line.

So, to summarize:

- Book: Wolf Hall

- Author: Hilary Mantel

- Release date: April 30, 2009

- It's famous.

Therefore, the answer is "Wolf Hall".
