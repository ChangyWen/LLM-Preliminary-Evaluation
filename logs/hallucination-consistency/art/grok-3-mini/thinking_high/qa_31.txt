*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1996-01-13, created by Jon Krakauer. I need to recall or know what book that is.

Jon Krakauer is a well-known author and journalist. One of his most famous books is "Into the Wild," which is about the story of Christopher McCandless. I think that book was published in 1996. Let me confirm the exact date.

The user specified the release date as 1996-01-13, which is January 13, 1996. I should verify if "Into the Wild" was indeed released on that date.

From my knowledge, "Into the Wild" by Jon Krakauer was published in 1996, and I believe January 13 is the correct date. It's a famous book that was adapted into a movie as well.

Other books by Jon Krakauer include "Into Thin Air" about the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, but that was published in 1997. So, it can't be that one.

"Into the Wild" is definitely the one from 1996. Let me make sure about the date. Upon thinking, yes, it was released on January 13, 1996.

The user asked for the name of the book and to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be straightforward: I can say something like, "The famous book released on January 13, 1996, by Jon Krakauer is 'Into the Wild'."

Then, at the end, on a new line, just put the answer: Into the Wild.

To be precise, I should confirm if there's any other book. Jon Krakauer's bibliography: "Eiger Dreams" was earlier, in 1990. "Into the Wild" in 1996, "Into Thin Air" in 1997. So, yes, it's "Into the Wild."

The date 1996-01-13 is specific, and I recall that's the publication date for "Into the Wild."

Finally, structure the response: Start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.
