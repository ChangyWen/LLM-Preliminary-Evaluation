*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on October 17, 1990, created by William Steig. I need to recall or know about William Steig's works.

William Steig was an American cartoonist and author, known for children's books. One of his most famous works is "Shrek!", which was published in 1990. I think it was released on October 17, 1990. That sounds familiar.

Let me confirm the date. From my knowledge, "Shrek!" by William Steig was indeed published in 1990, and I believe the specific date is October 17, 1990. The user specified that date, so it's likely correct.

Is "Shrek!" the famous book they're referring to? Yes, because it became extremely popular, especially after the animated film adaptations. It's one of Steig's most well-known works.

William Steig wrote other books, like "Sylvester and the Magic Pebble" or "Doctor De Soto," but those were published earlier. "Sylvester and the Magic Pebble" was in 1969, and "Doctor De Soto" in 1982. So, in 1990, "Shrek!" is the one that fits.

The user said "created by William Steig," and "released in 1990-10-17," which is October 17, 1990. I should verify if that's accurate, but based on common knowledge, it is.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start by confirming the details and then state the answer.

Final answer should be just the book name, probably "Shrek!".

Is it "Shrek!" or just "Shrek"? I think the book title is "Shrek!" with an exclamation mark.

Yes, that's correct.

So, to summarize:

- Book: Shrek! by William Steig

- Release date: October 17, 1990

- It's famous due to the franchise.

Now, for the response format: I need to have the final answer on a new line at the end.

Something like:

After considering the details, the famous book by William Steig released on October 17, 1990, is Shrek!.

Then, on a new line: Shrek!

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I should have some explanatory text, and then the answer separately.

To make it clear, I can say:

The famous book is Shrek! by William Steig, released on October 17, 1990.

But to follow the instruction precisely, I'll put the answer on a new line.

Final response structure:

- Optional: A brief confirmation or explanation.

- Then, on a new line, the answer.

Since the user might expect just the name, I'll keep it simple.
