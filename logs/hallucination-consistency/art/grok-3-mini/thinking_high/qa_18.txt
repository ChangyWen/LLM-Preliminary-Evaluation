*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book. The book was released on 2007-10-18, which is October 18, 2007, and it was created by Jay Asher.

I need to recall or know what book that is. I think Jay Asher is the author of "Thirteen Reasons Why." Let me confirm the release date.

From my knowledge, "Thirteen Reasons Why" was indeed published in 2007. I believe the exact date is October 18, 2007. That sounds familiar.

To be thorough, I should make sure there aren't other books by Jay Asher that might fit this description. Jay Asher is most famous for "Thirteen Reasons Why," which became a bestseller and was adapted into a Netflix series. I don't recall any other major books by him released around that time.

The user specifies "famous book," so it's likely referring to his most well-known work, which is "Thirteen Reasons Why."

Now, the user asks to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly. I should probably provide a bit of context or confirmation in the response, but keep it concise, and then put the answer on a new line.

Response structure:
- Start with a brief acknowledgment or confirmation.
- End with the answer on a new line.

Final answer should be just the book name: "Thirteen Reasons Why"

Make sure the date is correct. Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, "Thirteen Reasons Why" was released on October 18, 2007.

So, my response should be helpful and direct.
