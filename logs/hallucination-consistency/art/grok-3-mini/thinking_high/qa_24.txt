*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2020-05-19 and created by Suzanne Collins. I need to recall who Suzanne Collins is. She's the author of the Hunger Games series, which is very famous.

Now, the release date given is 2020-05-19. I need to think about what book she released around that time. I remember that in 2020, Suzanne Collins released a new book in the Hunger Games universe. I think it's called "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes." Let me confirm the release date in my knowledge base.

From what I know, "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" was indeed released in 2020. I believe the exact date is May 19, 2020. That matches the date provided: 2020-05-19.

Is this book famous? Yes, it's a prequel to the Hunger Games series and was highly anticipated and well-received, so it qualifies as famous.

The user specified "created by Suzanne Collins," which is correct, as she is the author.

Now, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly. I can provide a brief explanation and then state the answer clearly.

Final answer should be: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes

To make sure, let me double-check if there's any other book by Suzanne Collins released on that date. From my knowledge, that's the only major release around that time. Her previous works were the Hunger Games trilogy, which ended in 2010, and this prequel came out in 2020.

So, I'm confident with this.
