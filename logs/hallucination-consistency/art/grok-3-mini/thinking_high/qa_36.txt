*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book. The details given are: released on 2014-01-28, and created by Pierce Brown.

I need to recall or know about Pierce Brown's books. Pierce Brown is an author known for his science fiction series. His most famous work is the "Red Rising" series. The first book in that series is "Red Rising."

Now, I need to confirm the release date. I believe "Red Rising" by Pierce Brown was published in 2014. Let me think about the exact date. The user specified 2014-01-28, which is January 28, 2014.

From my knowledge, "Red Rising" was indeed released in 2014. I think it was published on January 28, 2014. That sounds familiar.

To be thorough, I should consider if there's any other book by Pierce Brown that might fit this description. Pierce Brown's debut novel is "Red Rising," and it's his most famous work. Subsequent books in the series came later, like "Golden Son" in 2015 and "Morning Star" in 2016.

So, the book released on January 28, 2014, should be "Red Rising."

The user asks for the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, but since the user asked for the name, I don't need to add extra fluff. Just provide the answer clearly.

Final answer should be: Red Rising

And it should be on a new line at the end.

So, in my response, I'll say something like: "The famous book by Pierce Brown released on January 28, 2014, is Red Rising."

Then, on a new line, just "Red Rising" as the final answer.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I should have some response text, and then the answer separately.

For example:

After considering the details, the book in question is "Red Rising."

[New line]

Red Rising

But to make it clear, I can phrase it nicely.

Since this is an AI response, I should be accurate. I am confident that "Red Rising" was released on January 28, 2014. I can double-check my internal knowledge, but based on standard knowledge, it's correct.

Alright, let's outline the response:

- Acknowledge the query.

- State the answer.

- End with the final answer on a new line.
