First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on November 20, 1990, created by Michael Crichton. I need to recall or know about Michael Crichton's works.

Michael Crichton is a well-known author, famous for books like Jurassic Park, which was turned into a movie. I think Jurassic Park was released around that time. Let me confirm the release date.

I remember that Jurassic Park the book was published in 1990. Now, the specific date given is November 20, 1990. Is that the exact release date for Jurassic Park?

From my knowledge, Jurassic Park was indeed published in 1990, but I need to verify the exact date. I think it was released in November 1990. Yes, I believe November 20, 1990, is the correct date for the publication of Jurassic Park.

Is there any other famous book by Michael Crichton released on that exact date? I don't think so. His other works include The Andromeda Strain, Congo, Sphere, but those were published in different years. For example, The Andromeda Strain was in 1969, Congo in 1980, Sphere in 1987. So, 1990 is specifically tied to Jurassic Park.

Jurassic Park became extremely famous, especially after the movie adaptation in 1993, but the book itself was a bestseller.

The user specified "famous book," and Jurassic Park fits that description perfectly.

Now, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly. Maybe I can add a bit of context or confirmation, but keep it concise.

Final answer should be: Jurassic Park

To be precise, the book is titled "Jurassic Park" by Michael Crichton.

I should make sure that the date is correct. Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, yes, Jurassic Park was published on November 20, 1990.

So, my response should end with the answer on a new line.
