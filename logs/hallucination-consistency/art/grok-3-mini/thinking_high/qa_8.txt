*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book. The book was released on 2001-06-19, which is June 19, 2001, and it's created by Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman. I know that Neil Gaiman is a well-known author, and his full name is Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman, so that matches.

Now, I need to recall what book Neil Gaiman released around that date. I'm familiar with his works. Some of his famous books include "American Gods," "Coraline," "The Sandman" series (which is graphic novels), "Neverwhere," etc.

Let me think about the release dates. I believe "American Gods" was published in 2001. Yes, I think it was released in June 2001. Let me confirm the exact date. The user specified 2001-06-19, so June 19, 2001.

Upon my knowledge, "American Gods" by Neil Gaiman was indeed published in 2001. I think the US release was on June 19, 2001. That sounds right.

To be thorough, let's consider if there are other books by Gaiman around that time. "Coraline" was published in 2002, so that's later. "Neverwhere" was in 1996, so earlier. "The Sandman" series ended in the 1990s. So, 2001 is likely "American Gods."

The user said "famous book," and "American Gods" is one of his most famous works. It won several awards and was adapted into a TV series.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward question, I can just confirm and answer.

Finally, the answer should be the name of the book: "American Gods."

Let me double-check the date. Upon quick recall, yes, "American Gods" was released on June 19, 2001, in the US.

So, I'm confident with this.
