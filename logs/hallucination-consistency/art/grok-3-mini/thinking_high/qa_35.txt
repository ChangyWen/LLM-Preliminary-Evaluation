*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2015-08-04 and created by N. K. Jemisin. I need to recall or know about N. K. Jemisin's works.

N. K. Jemisin is a well-known author, especially in the fantasy genre. She's famous for her Broken Earth trilogy. Let me think about the release dates.

The Broken Earth trilogy includes:

- The Fifth Season, which I believe was released in 2015.

- The Obelisk Gate in 2016.

- The Stone Sky in 2017.

Now, the specific date given is 2015-08-04. I need to confirm if that's the release date for The Fifth Season.

From my knowledge, The Fifth Season was indeed published in 2015. Let me verify the exact date. I think it was August 4, 2015. Yes, that sounds familiar.

To be thorough, I should ensure there aren't other books by N. K. Jemisin released on that date. Her other works include the Inheritance trilogy and the Dreamblood duology, but those were published earlier. For example, The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms was in 2010.

So, The Fifth Season is the one that matches the 2015 release.

The user specifies "famous book," and The Fifth Season is indeed famous; it won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2016.

Now, the user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start by confirming the details and then state the answer.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

Answer: The Fifth Season
