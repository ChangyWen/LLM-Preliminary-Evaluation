*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2016-09-13 and created by Mark Manson. I need to recall or know what book that is.

Mark Manson is an author, and one of his most famous books is "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck." I think that's the one. Let me confirm the release date.

From my knowledge, "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" was published in 2016. I believe the exact date is September 13, 2016. That matches the date given: 2016-09-13.

Is there any other book by Mark Manson that might have been released on that date? I don't think so. He's known for that book, and it's his bestseller. His other works might not be as famous or released on that specific date.

The user specified "famous book," so it's likely referring to his most well-known work, which is "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck."

Now, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly. Maybe I can add a bit of context or confirmation, but keep it concise.

Final answer should be: The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck

I should make sure about the title. It's often abbreviated, but the full title is "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck." Sometimes it's written with asterisks to censor, but in formal responses, it's fine to use the common title.

Also, ensure the date is correct. Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, it was released on September 13, 2016.

Response structure: I can say something like, "Based on the information, the famous book by Mark Manson released on September 13, 2016, is 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck'." Then, on a new line, put the answer.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I should have some explanatory text, and then the answer separately.

For example:

"I believe the book you're referring to is 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck' by Mark Manson, which was indeed published on September 13, 2016.

Final answer: The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck"

That should work.

Make sure the answer is accurate. I'm confident with this.
