*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2005-04-12 and created by Steven Levitt. I need to recall if I know about this book.

I remember that Steven Levitt is an economist, and he's famous for co-authoring a book with Stephen Dubner. The book is "Freakonomics". Let me confirm the release date.

From my knowledge, "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything" was published in 2005. I think the exact date is April 12, 2005. That matches the date given: 2005-04-12.

Is there any other book by Steven Levitt that might fit this description? Levitt is primarily known for "Freakonomics" and its sequels, but the first one was in 2005. The sequels came later, like "SuperFreakonomics" in 2009, so 2005 should be "Freakonomics".

The user specified "created by Steven Levitt", but technically, it's co-authored with Stephen J. Dubner. However, Levitt is often credited as the main author in popular references, and the book is famously associated with him. I think it's safe to assume they mean "Freakonomics".

The date 2005-04-12 is specific, and I believe that's the release date for "Freakonomics". I should confirm this, but since I'm an AI, I'll rely on my trained knowledge.

Finally, the user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

Response structure:
- I can briefly acknowledge the query.
- Then, directly state the answer at the end on a new line.

Final answer should be: Freakonomics

To be precise, the full title is "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything". But the user asked for "the name of the famous book", so probably just "Freakonomics" is sufficient, as it's commonly known.

I'll go with that.
