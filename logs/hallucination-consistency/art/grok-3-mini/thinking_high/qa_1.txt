*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Stephen King that was released on September 15, 1986.

I need to recall Stephen King's bibliography. He's a prolific author, and one of his famous books from that time period is "It." I think "It" was published in 1986. Let me confirm the exact date.

From my knowledge, "It" by Stephen King was indeed published in 1986. I believe the release date is September 15, 1986. That matches the date given in the query.

Is there any other book by Stephen King released on that exact date? Stephen King has many books, but "It" is one of his most famous, and it's specifically tied to that date. Other books around that time include "The Eyes of the Dragon" in 1984 and "Misery" in 1987, so 1986 is likely "It."

The user specified "famous book," and "It" is extremely famous, adapted into movies and miniseries.

Now, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly. I can provide a brief explanation and then state the answer clearly.

Response structure:
- Start with a confirmation or brief explanation.
- End with the answer on a new line.

Final answer should be just the book name, probably "It".

To be precise, let me double-check the release date. Upon recalling, yes, "It" was published on September 15, 1986, in the United States.

So, my response should be helpful and direct.
