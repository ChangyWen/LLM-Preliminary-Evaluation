*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1961-06-01 and created by Robert A. Heinlein. I need to recall or know about Robert A. Heinlein's works.

Robert A. Heinlein is a famous science fiction author. Some of his well-known books include "Stranger in a Strange Land," "Starship Troopers," and "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress."

The specific release date given is 1961-06-01, which is June 1, 1961. I need to remember which book by Heinlein was published on that date.

I think "Stranger in a Strange Land" was published in 1961. Let me confirm the exact date. From my knowledge, "Stranger in a Strange Land" was indeed published in 1961, and I believe it was on June 1, 1961. That sounds familiar.

To be thorough, let's consider if there are other books by Heinlein from around that time. "Starship Troopers" was published in 1959, and "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" was in 1966, so 1961 should be "Stranger in a Strange Land."

The user specified the exact date, 1961-06-01, so I should verify if that's accurate. Assuming my knowledge is correct, "Stranger in a Strange Land" is the book.

The user asks for the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start by confirming the details and then state the answer.

Final answer should be just the book name on a new line.

So, the book is "Stranger in a Strange Land."
