*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1996-08-17, created by Chuck Palahniuk. I need to recall or know what book that is.

Chuck Palahniuk is a well-known author, and one of his most famous books is "Fight Club." I think "Fight Club" was published in 1996. Let me confirm the exact date.

From my knowledge, "Fight Club" was indeed published in 1996. The user specified the date 1996-08-17, which is August 17, 1996. I should verify if that's the correct release date.

Upon thinking, I recall that "Fight Club" was released in August 1996. Yes, that sounds right. It's one of his most famous works, and it was adapted into a famous movie in 1999.

Now, to be thorough, I should make sure there aren't any other books by Chuck Palahniuk released on that exact date. But "Fight Club" is his debut novel and the most prominent one from that time.

The user asked for the name of the book and to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start by confirming the details and then state the answer.

Final answer should be on a new line, so I'll write something like:

The famous book is Fight Club.

But to make it clear, I'll put it in a new line as specified.

Also, ensure that the answer is accurate. Let me double-check the release date. From my knowledge, "Fight Club" was published on August 17, 1996, in the United States. Yes, that matches.

So, the book is "Fight Club."
