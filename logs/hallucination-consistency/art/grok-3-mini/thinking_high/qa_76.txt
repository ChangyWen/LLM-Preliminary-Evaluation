*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2005-04-12 and created by Steven Levitt. I need to recall or know what book that is.

Steven Levitt is an economist, and he's famous for co-authoring a book with Stephen Dubner. The book is "Freakonomics". I think that's the one.

Now, I need to confirm the release date. The user specified 2005-04-12, which is April 12, 2005. I believe "Freakonomics" was published in 2005. Let me make sure about the exact date.

From my knowledge, "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything" was indeed published in 2005. I think the release date is April 12, 2005, but I should confirm that. Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll assume that's correct based on common knowledge.

The user said "created by Steven Levitt". Actually, Steven Levitt co-authored it with Stephen J. Dubner. But the user specified "created by Steven Levitt", so I'll go with that, as Levitt is the primary economist behind it.

Is there any other famous book by Steven Levitt released on that date? I don't think so. "Freakonomics" is his most famous work.

The user asks for the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start by confirming the book and then state the answer.

Final answer should be just the book name, probably "Freakonomics".

To be precise, let me double-check the date. Upon quick recall, yes, "Freakonomics" was released on April 12, 2005.

So, the answer is "Freakonomics".
