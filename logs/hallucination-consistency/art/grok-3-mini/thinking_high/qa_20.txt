*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on January 17, 1966, created by Truman Capote. I need to recall if I know about Truman Capote and his works.

Truman Capote is a famous American author known for books like "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and "In Cold Blood." "In Cold Blood" is a non-fiction novel that I think was published around that time.

I remember that "In Cold Blood" was published in 1966. Let me confirm the exact date. The user specified January 17, 1966. Is that the release date for "In Cold Blood"?

From my knowledge, "In Cold Blood" was indeed published in 1966. I think it was serialized in The New Yorker magazine starting in 1965, and then published as a book in 1966. But is January 17 the exact date?

I'm not 100% sure about the exact date, but the user specified it, so probably that's correct. I should verify if "In Cold Blood" is the book they're referring to.

Let me think about Truman Capote's bibliography. His other famous works include "Breakfast at Tiffany's" which was published in 1958, so that's earlier. "In Cold Blood" is his most famous work after that, and it's often cited as a groundbreaking true crime novel.

Assuming the date is correct, "In Cold Blood" should be the answer. The user said "released in 1966-01-17," which is January 17, 1966. I should confirm if that's accurate.

Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, I recall that "In Cold Blood" was published on January 17, 1966, in the United States. Yes, that sounds right.

The user asked for the name of the book and to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be straightforward: I can say something like, "The famous book released on January 17, 1966, by Truman Capote is 'In Cold Blood'."

Then, on a new line, just the answer: "In Cold Blood"

To make it clear, I should ensure that my response is helpful and directly addresses the query.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
