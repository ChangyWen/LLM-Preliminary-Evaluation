First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book. The details given are:

- Released on 2002-07-02

- Created by Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman

I know that Neil Gaiman is a well-known author, and his full name is Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman. That matches.

Now, I need to recall or know which book of his was released on July 2, 2002. I'm familiar with some of his works. Let me think about his bibliography.

Some famous books by Neil Gaiman:

- "American Gods" – I think this was published in 2001. Wait, no, let me confirm. Actually, "American Gods" was first published in 2001.

- "Coraline" – That was published in 2002. I think it was released in July 2002. Let me double-check that.

Upon thinking, yes, "Coraline" by Neil Gaiman was published in 2002. Specifically, I believe the US release was on July 2, 2002. That sounds right.

Let me confirm the date: 2002-07-02 is July 2, 2002. Yes, "Coraline" was indeed released on that date in the US.

Is "Coraline" famous? Absolutely, it's one of his most popular works, especially known for its adaptation into a film by Henry Selick.

Other books by Gaiman around that time:

- "American Gods" was 2001.

- "Anansi Boys" was 2005.

- "The Ocean at the End of the Lane" was much later, in 2013.

So, 2002 points to "Coraline."

The user specified "created by Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman," which is correct, and the date matches.

Now, the user asks to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. Since this is a straightforward question, I can confirm the details and then state the answer.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

So, the book is "Coraline."
