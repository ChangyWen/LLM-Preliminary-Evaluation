*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Stephen King that was released on September 8, 1981.

I need to recall Stephen King's bibliography. He's a prolific author, and one of his famous books from around that time is "Cujo." Let me confirm the release date.

I think "Cujo" was published in 1981. Let me make sure about the exact date. The user specified September 8, 1981.

Upon thinking, I recall that "Cujo" was indeed released in 1981. But is the exact date September 8? I'm not entirely sure, but I think that's correct.

Stephen King has written many books. Other books from around that time include "The Shining" (1977), "The Stand" (1978), "The Dead Zone" (1979), "Firestarter" (1980), and then "Cujo" in 1981. Yes, "Cujo" is the one for 1981.

Now, to confirm the exact release date. From my knowledge, "Cujo" was published on September 8, 1981. That sounds familiar.

The user said "famous book," and "Cujo" is indeed one of his famous works, adapted into a movie as well.

I should ensure there isn't another book by Stephen King released on that exact date. I don't think so; "Cujo" is the primary one.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, but since the instruction is to reason step by step (which I'm doing here), in the actual response, I should be concise.

The reasoning is for me to think through, but the response to the user should be clear.

So, final answer: The book is "Cujo."

Let me double-check the date. Upon quick mental search, yes, "Cujo" by Stephen King was released on September 8, 1981.

Alright, I'm confident.
