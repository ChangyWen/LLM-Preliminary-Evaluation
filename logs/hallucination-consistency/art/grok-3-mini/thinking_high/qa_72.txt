*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on February 19, 1963, created by Betty Friedan. I need to recall what that book is.

Betty Friedan is a well-known feminist author. Her most famous book is "The Feminine Mystique." I believe that's the one released in 1963.

Let me confirm the date. The user specified February 19, 1963. I think "The Feminine Mystique" was indeed published in 1963, but I should verify the exact date. From my knowledge, it was published in February 1963, and I think February 19 is correct, but I'm not 100% sure. Since this is a common fact, I'll assume it's accurate for this context.

The book is famous for sparking the second wave of feminism in the United States. It's a landmark work.

Now, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly. I should probably provide a bit of context or confirmation in the response, but keep it concise, and then put the answer on a new line.

Response structure:
- Start with a brief acknowledgment or confirmation.
- End with the answer on a new line.

Final answer should be just the name of the book: "The Feminine Mystique"

Make sure the answer is accurate. I don't think Betty Friedan has another famous book from that exact date. "The Feminine Mystique" is her most prominent work.

Date confirmation: Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, "The Feminine Mystique" was published on February 19, 1963.

So, my response should be helpful and direct.
