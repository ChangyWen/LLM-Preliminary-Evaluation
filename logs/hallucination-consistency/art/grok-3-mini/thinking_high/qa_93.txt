First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2006-10-02, created by Richard Dawkins. I need to recall what book that is.

Richard Dawkins is a well-known evolutionary biologist and author. One of his famous books is "The God Delusion." I think that was published around that time. Let me confirm the date.

I remember "The God Delusion" was published in 2006. The specific date given is 2006-10-02, which is October 2, 2006. I should verify if that's the correct release date.

From my knowledge, "The God Delusion" was indeed released in October 2006. I think the exact date might be October 2, 2006, but I'm not 100% sure. Since the user specified that date, and it's a famous book by Dawkins, it's likely referring to that one.

Dawkins' other books include "The Selfish Gene" (1976), "The Blind Watchmaker" (1986), "Climbing Mount Improbable" (1996), "The Ancestor's Tale" (2004), and then "The God Delusion" in 2006. After that, he had "The Greatest Show on Earth" in 2009. So, 2006 is specifically for "The God Delusion."

The date 2006-10-02 matches the release of "The God Delusion." I believe that's correct.

The user asks for the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly. I should probably give a brief response and then put the answer on a new line.

My response should be helpful and accurate. Since this is based on my knowledge, I'll assume it's correct.

Final answer: The book is "The God Delusion."

Now, to format it as instructed: end with the answer on a new line.
