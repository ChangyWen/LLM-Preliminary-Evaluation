*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2005-04-12 and created by Stephen Dubner. I need to recall or know about Stephen Dubner's works.

Stephen Dubner is known for co-authoring books with Steven Levitt. The most famous one is "Freakonomics". I think "Freakonomics" was published in 2005. Let me confirm the date.

The date given is 2005-04-12, which is April 12, 2005. I believe "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything" was indeed published in 2005. I should verify if that's the exact date.

Upon thinking, I recall that "Freakonomics" was released in April 2005. Yes, April 12, 2005, sounds familiar. Stephen Dubner is the co-author along with Steven Levitt.

The user says "created by Stephen Dubner". While Dubner is a co-author, it's often attributed to both. But the question specifies Dubner, so "Freakonomics" should be the answer.

Is there any other book by Stephen Dubner released on that exact date? Dubner is primarily known for "Freakonomics" and its sequels. His first major work was "Freakonomics", and before that, he might have written other things, but nothing as famous with that release date.

Let me double-check the release date. From my knowledge, "Freakonomics" was published on April 12, 2005, in the US. Yes, that matches.

The user asks for the name of the book and to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should be concise, and end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer should be: Freakonomics

To be precise, the full title is "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything".

But the user asked for "the name of the famous book", so probably "Freakonomics" is sufficient, as it's commonly referred to.

In the response, I should not add extra information unless necessary, but since the user specified to reason step by step, I can include my thought process, but the final answer should be clean.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I need to have my reasoning, and then on a new line, just the answer.

Also, ensure that the answer is accurate. I think it is.
