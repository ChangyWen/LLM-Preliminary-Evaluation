*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book. The details given are: released on 1996-09-05, and created by Frank McCourt.

I need to recall who Frank McCourt is. He's an Irish-American author, famous for his memoir about his childhood in Ireland.

The book that comes to mind is "Angela's Ashes." I think that's his most famous work. Let me confirm the release date.

From my knowledge, "Angela's Ashes" was published in 1996. The date given is 1996-09-05, which is September 5, 1996. I believe that's the correct release date for "Angela's Ashes."

To double-check, I know that "Angela's Ashes" won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography in 1997, which aligns with a 1996 publication.

Frank McCourt's other works include "Tis" and "'Tis," which is a sequel, but that was published later, in 1999. So, the 1996 book should be "Angela's Ashes."

The user specified the date as 1996-09-05, which is specific. I should ensure that this is accurate. Based on standard knowledge, yes, "Angela's Ashes" was released on September 5, 1996.

The user asks for the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, but since the instruction is to give the final answer in a new line, I'll keep it concise.

Final answer should be: Angela's Ashes

Make sure it's in a new line. So, in text, that would be after my response, on a new line.

Response structure:

- Acknowledge the query.

- Provide the answer clearly.

- End with the answer on a new line.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I should have some response text, and then the answer.

For example:

"I believe the famous book you're referring to is Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, which was indeed published on September 5, 1996.

Final answer: Angela's Ashes"

But to be precise, I'll put it on a new line.

Also, ensure that the answer is just the book name, as per the question.

The question is: "What is the name of the famous book..." so the answer should be the name.

Confirm if there's any other book by Frank McCourt from that date. I don't think so; "Angela's Ashes" is his debut and most famous work.

I'm confident with this.
