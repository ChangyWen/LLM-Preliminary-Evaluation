*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2017-05-02 and created by Jenny Han. I need to recall or know about Jenny Han's books.

Jenny Han is an author known for young adult fiction. Some of her famous works include the "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" series. Let me think about the release dates.

The book "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" was released in 2014. That's not 2017. The sequels might be later. I think "P.S. I Still Love You" is the second book in the series. I believe that was released in 2015. Still not 2017.

There's a third book in the series. I think it's called "Always and Forever, Lara Jean." When was that released? I think it was in 2017. Let me confirm the date.

The user specified the release date as 2017-05-02, which is May 2, 2017. I need to check if "Always and Forever, Lara Jean" was released on that exact date.

From my knowledge, "Always and Forever, Lara Jean" by Jenny Han was indeed published in 2017. I think the release date is May 2, 2017. That sounds familiar.

Is this book famous? Yes, it's part of a popular series that was adapted into a Netflix movie, so it's well-known.

Are there any other books by Jenny Han released on that date? I don't think so. Her main works are the "To All the Boys" trilogy and perhaps some others, but "Always and Forever, Lara Jean" fits the description.

Just to be thorough, let me recall her bibliography. She also wrote "The Summer I Turned Pretty" series, but I think those were released earlier. "The Summer I Turned Pretty" was in 2009, and sequels in 2010 and 2011. Not 2017.

She might have other books, but 2017 is specifically tied to the third book in the "To All the Boys" series.

So, the book should be "Always and Forever, Lara Jean."

The user asked for the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start by confirming the details and then state the answer.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
