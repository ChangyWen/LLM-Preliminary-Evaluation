First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Stephen King that was released on April 5, 1974. I need to recall if Stephen King has a book that matches this date.

Stephen King is a famous author, and one of his early works is "Carrie." I think "Carrie" was his first published novel. Let me confirm the release date.

From my knowledge, "Carrie" was published in 1974. I believe it was released in April 1974. Specifically, I think it was on April 5, 1974. That sounds familiar.

Let me double-check my facts. Stephen King's "Carrie" was indeed published in 1974, and I recall that it was a breakthrough for him. The exact date—April 5, 1974—seems correct based on what I know.

Are there any other books by Stephen King from 1974? I don't think so. "Carrie" was his debut novel, and it was published in that year. Subsequent books came later, like "Salem's Lot" in 1975.

The user specified "famous book," and "Carrie" is certainly famous, as it was adapted into movies and has become a classic in horror genre.

The user asked for the answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should not be verbose; I should keep it clear and direct. But since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll think step by step here, but in the actual response, I'll be concise.

Final answer should be just the name of the book, probably "Carrie," on a new line.

To confirm: Release date of "Carrie" is April 5, 1974. Yes, that's accurate.

So, the answer is "Carrie."
