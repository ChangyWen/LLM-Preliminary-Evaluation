*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2012-09-19 and created by Joël Dicker. I need to recall or know about Joël Dicker's books.

Joël Dicker is a Swiss author, and one of his most famous books is "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair." I think that book was published around that time.

Let me confirm the release date. The user specified 2012-09-19, which is September 19, 2012. I believe "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair" was indeed published in 2012. I should verify if the exact date matches.

Upon thinking, I recall that the book was first published in French as "La Vérité sur l'Affaire Harry Quebert" in 2012. Let me check the exact date. From my knowledge, it was released in September 2012, but I'm not sure about the 19th specifically. The user gave a precise date, so I need to assume that's correct or recall accurately.

Assuming the date is correct, and Joël Dicker's famous book matches that, it should be "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair."

Is there any other book by Joël Dicker that might have been released on that date? I don't think so. His debut novel was this one, and it became very popular.

The book won several awards and was a bestseller, so it fits the "famous" description.

Now, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start by confirming the information and then state the answer.

Final answer should be just the book name on a new line.

So, the book is "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair." But should I use the English title or the original French? The user asked in English, and the book is often referred to in English, so I'll go with that.

To be precise, the original title is "La Vérité sur l'Affaire Harry Quebert," but since the question is in English, I'll use the English translation.

Confirming the release date: Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, it was published on September 19, 2012, in French.

Alright, so my answer is clear.
