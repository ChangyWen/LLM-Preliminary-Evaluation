*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1999-06-08, created by Thomas Harris. I need to recall who Thomas Harris is and what books he's known for.

Thomas Harris is the author of the Hannibal Lecter series. His most famous books include "Red Dragon," "The Silence of the Lambs," and "Hannibal."

Now, the release date given is 1999-06-08. I need to remember which book was released around that time. Let me think about the publication dates:

- "Red Dragon" was published in 1981.

- "The Silence of the Lambs" was published in 1988.

- "Hannibal" was published in 1999. I think that's the one. Let me confirm the exact date.

From my knowledge, "Hannibal" by Thomas Harris was indeed published in 1999. I believe the release date is June 8, 1999, which matches the date given: 1999-06-08.

To be thorough, let's ensure there aren't any other books by Thomas Harris released on that date. His next book after "Hannibal" was "Hannibal Rising" in 2006, so 1999 should be "Hannibal."

The user specifies "famous book," and "Hannibal" is quite famous, being part of the popular series that includes the Oscar-winning film adaptation of "The Silence of the Lambs."

So, the book is "Hannibal."

The user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, but since the instruction is to give the final answer in a new line, I'll keep it concise.

Final answer: Hannibal

I should make sure the date is correct. Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, "Hannibal" was released on June 8, 1999.

So, I'm confident with this.
