*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 1, 2000, created by Robert Kiyosaki. I need to recall what book that is.

Robert Kiyosaki is known for his book "Rich Dad Poor Dad." I think that's his most famous book. Now, I need to confirm the release date.

From my knowledge, "Rich Dad Poor Dad" was first published in 1997. That doesn't match the date given: 2000-04-01. The user specified 2000-04-01, which is April 1, 2000.

Maybe there's a specific edition or something. Perhaps the user meant a different book or there's a mistake in the date.

Let me think about Robert Kiyosaki's bibliography. After "Rich Dad Poor Dad" in 1997, he might have released other books. But is there one specifically on April 1, 2000?

I recall that "Rich Dad Poor Dad" was updated or had new editions. Perhaps there was a release or a significant event on that date.

Maybe the user is referring to the date when it became famous or something, but the question says "released in 2000-04-01."

Perhaps it's "Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant" or another book in the series. Let me recall the publication dates.

Upon thinking, "Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant" was published in 2000. I think it was released around that time. Let me confirm: yes, "Cashflow Quadrant" was published in 2000.

Now, the exact date: April 1, 2000. I'm not sure about the exact day, but it's possible. The user specified the date, so I should go with that.

But the most famous book is "Rich Dad Poor Dad," but it was 1997. Unless there's a re-release.

Perhaps the user has the date wrong, but I should answer based on standard knowledge.

Maybe it's "Rich Dad Poor Dad" that was released in a different format or edition on that date.

But to be accurate, I think "Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant" is the book that came out in 2000.

Let me double-check my memory: Robert Kiyosaki's "Rich Dad Poor Dad" was 1997, and "Cashflow Quadrant" is indeed from 2000.

Regarding the exact date, April 1, 2000, might be specific, but since the user mentioned it, I'll assume that's correct.

Now, is "Cashflow Quadrant" as famous? It's part of the series, but "Rich Dad Poor Dad" is the flagship.

The question says "famous book" and "created by Robert Kiyosaki," and specifies the date.

Perhaps I should confirm if there's a book released on that exact date.

Maybe it's a trick, and April 1 is April Fool's Day, but that seems unlikely.

Another thought: perhaps the user meant 1997, but typed 2000 by mistake. But I have to go with what's asked.

Let's think: Robert Kiyosaki's books â€“ "Rich Dad Poor Dad" (1997), "Cashflow Quadrant" (2000), "Guide to Investing" (2000 or later), etc.

Upon recollection, "Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant: Rich Dad's Guide to Financial Freedom" was published in 2000.

I think the exact release date might not be April 1, but since the user specified it, and it's close, perhaps that's it.

Maybe it's "Rich Dad Poor Dad" that had a paperback release or something in 2000.

But to answer the question, I think the book released in 2000 by Kiyosaki is "Cashflow Quadrant."

Now, is it famous? Yes, it's well-known in financial literacy circles.

The user said "famous book," and while "Rich Dad Poor Dad" is more iconic, the date doesn't match.

Perhaps the user is referring to the date when it was published in a certain region or edition.

But I need to provide an answer.

Let me see the question again: "released in 2000-04-01" which is April 1, 2000.

Upon a quick mental search, I think "Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant" was indeed published in 2000, and it's possible the date is correct.

To be precise, I'll go with "Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant."

But let's make sure. I recall that "Rich Dad Poor Dad" was first published in 1997, and it gained popularity later, but the release was 1997.

Perhaps the user meant the book that made him famous around that time, but the question specifies the release date.

Another book: "Rich Dad's Guide to Investing" was published in 2000 as well, I think.

Actually, upon thinking, Kiyosaki released several books in the series.

But "Cashflow Quadrant" is from 2000.

Now, for the final answer, I need to put it in a new line at the end.

So, I'll say the book is "Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant."

But is that the most famous? The question says "famous book," but it specifies the date, so it should be the one released on that date.

Perhaps it's "Rich Dad Poor Dad" if there's a misremembered date.

But I think I should stick with the date.

Let's assume that "Cashflow Quadrant" is the answer.

So, my response will be: After reasoning, I believe the book is "Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant."

Then, final answer on a new line.
