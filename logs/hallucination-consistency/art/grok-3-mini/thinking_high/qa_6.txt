*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2002-02-28 and created by Richard K. Morgan. I need to recall or know about Richard K. Morgan's works.

Richard K. Morgan is a science fiction author. One of his famous books is "Altered Carbon," which is part of a series. I think "Altered Carbon" was published in 2002. Let me confirm the exact date.

The user specified the release date as 2002-02-28, which is February 28, 2002. I need to verify if that's the release date for "Altered Carbon."

From my knowledge, "Altered Carbon" was indeed published in 2002. I should check if the exact date matches. Upon thinking, I recall that "Altered Carbon" was released in the UK on February 28, 2002, by Gollancz. That sounds right.

Is it famous? Yes, "Altered Carbon" became very popular, especially after it was adapted into a Netflix series in 2018.

Are there any other books by Richard K. Morgan released on that exact date? I don't think so. His debut novel is "Altered Carbon," and it's his most well-known work.

Just to be thorough, let's list some of his other works:

- Altered Carbon (2002)

- Broken Angels (2003)

- Woken Furies (2005)

- Market Forces (2004)

- Black Man/Thirteen (2007)

So, in 2002, "Altered Carbon" is the one. And the date 2002-02-28 seems specific, so it's likely correct.

The user asked for the name of the book and to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be straightforward, perhaps with a bit of confirmation, but keep it concise.

Final answer should be: Altered Carbon

Make sure it's in a new line. So, I'll write a short response and then the answer on a new line.
