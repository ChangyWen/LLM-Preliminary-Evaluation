*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 21, 1962, created by Shirley Jackson. I need to recall or know what book that is.

Shirley Jackson is a famous author, known for her short story "The Lottery" and her novels. One of her most famous works is "The Haunting of Hill House," but I need to check the release date.

I think "The Haunting of Hill House" was published in 1959, not 1962. That doesn't match.

What about other books by Shirley Jackson? She wrote "We Have Always Lived in the Castle." I believe that was published in 1962. Let me confirm the date.

Yes, "We Have Always Lived in the Castle" by Shirley Jackson was indeed published in 1962. And the specific date mentioned is September 21, 1962. I should verify if that's accurate.

Upon thinking, I recall that "We Have Always Lived in the Castle" was published on September 21, 1962, in the United States. That seems correct.

Is this book famous? Yes, it's considered one of her masterpieces, often studied for its themes of isolation and psychological horror.

The user specified the date as 1962-09-21, which is September 21, 1962. I need to make sure there isn't another book by her released on that exact date. From my knowledge, "We Have Always Lived in the Castle" is the one.

Shirley Jackson passed away in 1965, so 1962 is plausible for her last major work. "We Have Always Lived in the Castle" was her final novel.

So, the answer should be "We Have Always Lived in the Castle."

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start by confirming the details and then state the answer.

Final answer format: Just the book name on a new line.
