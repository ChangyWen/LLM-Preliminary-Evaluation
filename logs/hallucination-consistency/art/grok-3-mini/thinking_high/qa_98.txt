First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 8, 1995, created by Michael Crichton. I need to recall if I know any books by Michael Crichton from that time.

Michael Crichton is known for books like Jurassic Park, which was published in 1990. That's before 1995. What about other books?

I think Michael Crichton wrote "Disclosure" in 1994, and then "The Lost World" in 1995. "The Lost World" is a sequel to Jurassic Park.

Let me confirm the release date. I believe "The Lost World" by Michael Crichton was published in 1995. The user specified September 8, 1995. Is that the exact date?

Upon thinking, I recall that "The Lost World" was indeed released in 1995. But is the exact date September 8? I'm not entirely sure, but the user mentioned it, so perhaps that's correct.

Michael Crichton's bibliography: After "Jurassic Park" in 1990, he wrote "Rising Sun" in 1992, "Disclosure" in 1994, and then "The Lost World" in 1995. Yes, that sounds right.

Now, is "The Lost World" famous? Absolutely, it's a bestseller and was adapted into a movie.

The user said "released in 1995-09-08", which is September 8, 1995. I should verify if that's accurate. Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll assume the date is correct based on the query.

Could there be another book by Crichton released on that exact date? I don't think so. "The Lost World" is the one that fits.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be concise, and end with the book name on a new line.

Answer: The famous book is "The Lost World".
