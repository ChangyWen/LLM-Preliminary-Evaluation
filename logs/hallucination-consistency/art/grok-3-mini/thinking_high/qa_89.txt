*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on October 21, 1977, created by Katherine Paterson. I need to recall or know about Katherine Paterson's works.

Katherine Paterson is a well-known children's author. One of her most famous books is "Bridge to Terabithia." I think that was published in 1977. Let me confirm the date.

I believe "Bridge to Terabithia" was indeed published in 1977. Now, the specific date given is October 21, 1977. I need to check if that's the exact release date.

From my knowledge, "Bridge to Terabithia" is a famous book, and it won the Newbery Medal in 1978, which suggests it was published in 1977. But is the exact date October 21? I'm not entirely sure, but the user specified that date, so probably that's correct for this context.

Other books by Katherine Paterson include "Jacob Have I Loved," which won the Newbery in 1981, so that's later. "The Great Gilly Hopkins" was published in 1978. So, 1977 should be "Bridge to Terabithia."

To confirm, I should think if there's any other book by her from that exact date. But based on common knowledge, "Bridge to Terabithia" is the one.

The user said "released in 1977-10-21," which is October 21, 1977. I need to verify if that's accurate. Upon quick reflection, I think the publication date might be around that time, but I'm not 100% sure. However, since the user stated it, and it's a famous book, I'll go with that.

Finally, the user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "The famous book released on October 21, 1977, by Katherine Paterson is 'Bridge to Terabithia'."

Then, on a new line, just the answer.

To be precise, I'll box the answer as per the instruction.

Final answer should be: Bridge to Terabithia

But let me make sure. Is there any chance it's another book? I don't think so. Katherine Paterson's bibliography confirms "Bridge to Terabithia" as her 1977 work.

So, I'll proceed.
