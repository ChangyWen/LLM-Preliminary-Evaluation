*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 1, 1979, created by Michael Ende. I need to recall who Michael Ende is and what books he's known for.

Michael Ende is a German writer, famous for fantasy novels. His most well-known book is "The NeverEnding Story." I think that's the one.

Now, I need to confirm the release date. The user specified 1979-09-01, which is September 1, 1979. I believe "The NeverEnding Story" was published in 1979. Let me make sure about the exact date. I'm not 100% sure about the day, but the year is correct. Upon thinking, I recall that the original German version, "Die unendliche Geschichte," was published in 1979. Yes, that matches.

Is there any other famous book by Michael Ende released on that exact date? I don't think so. His other works include "Momo," which was published in 1973, so that's earlier. "The NeverEnding Story" is his most famous one from 1979.

The user said "created by Michael Ende," and the date is specific. I should confirm if September 1 is accurate. In my knowledge, the book was published in 1979, but I might not have the exact day. However, since the user specified it, and it's likely correct, I'll go with that.

The book is famously known as "The NeverEnding Story" in English, but originally it's "Die unendliche Geschichte." Since the user is asking in English, I should probably give the English title.

The user didn't specify the language, but the date and the name "Michael Ende" suggest it could be the original or the translated version. But "The NeverEnding Story" was published in German in 1979 and later translated.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, "Die unendliche Geschichte" was first published on September 1, 1979, in Germany. That seems to match.

So, the famous book is "The NeverEnding Story."

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "The famous book by Michael Ende released on September 1, 1979, is 'The NeverEnding Story'."

But to be precise, the original title is in German, but in English, it's commonly known as "The NeverEnding Story." I think that's fine.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

So, response structure:

- Acknowledge the query.

- Provide the answer.

- Then, on a new line, state the book name.
