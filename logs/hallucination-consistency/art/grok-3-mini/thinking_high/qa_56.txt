*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Agatha Christie that was released on November 3, 1958. I need to recall or know about Agatha Christie's works.

Agatha Christie is a famous mystery writer, known for books like "Murder on the Orient Express," "And Then There Were None," and many others. I need to find out which one was published on that specific date.

The date given is 1958-11-03, which is November 3, 1958. I should check if I know any of her books from that year.

I remember that Agatha Christie wrote "Cat Among the Pigeons," but I'm not sure about the exact publication date. Let me think about her bibliography.

Upon recalling, I think "Cat Among the Pigeons" was published in 1959, not 1958. That might not be it.

Another book is "Ordeal by Innocence," which I think was published in 1958. Let me confirm that.

Yes, "Ordeal by Innocence" was first published in 1958. Now, I need to check the exact date. The user specified November 3, 1958. Is that the release date for "Ordeal by Innocence"?

I'm not entirely sure about the exact date, but based on common knowledge, "Ordeal by Innocence" is a novel by Agatha Christie published in 1958. I should verify if the date matches.

Perhaps the user has the date correct, and I need to recall the book. Let me think if there's another book.

Agatha Christie's books often have specific publication dates. Maybe I can reason that "Ordeal by Innocence" is the one.

Upon double-checking my memory, I believe "Ordeal by Innocence" was indeed published in November 1958 in the UK. Let me confirm the exact day.

The user said "released in 1958-11-03," which is November 3, 1958. I need to see if that's accurate.

Assuming that the date is correct, and based on standard knowledge, "Ordeal by Innocence" is the book that fits.

To be precise, I should state the book name.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should lead to the answer, and then on a new line, just the book name.

Let me outline the response:

- Acknowledge the query.

- Confirm the book based on knowledge.

- State the answer clearly.

Final answer should be: Ordeal by Innocence

I think that's it.
