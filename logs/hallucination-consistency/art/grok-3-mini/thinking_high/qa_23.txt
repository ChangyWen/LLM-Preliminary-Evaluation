*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book. The details given are: released on 2000-03-07, and created by Mark Z. Danielewski.

I need to recall or know about Mark Z. Danielewski. He's an author, and his most famous work is "House of Leaves." I think that's the one.

Now, confirm the release date. The date given is 2000-03-07, which is March 7, 2000. I believe "House of Leaves" was indeed published in 2000. Let me make sure about the exact date. From my knowledge, "House of Leaves" was published on March 7, 2000. That matches.

Is it famous? Yes, "House of Leaves" is well-known for its experimental style, with unusual formatting, footnotes, and it's often considered a cult classic in horror and literary fiction.

The user specified "created by Mark Z. Danielewski." That's correct; he is the author.

Now, the user asks to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly. Maybe provide a bit of context or confirmation, but keep it concise, and then put the answer on a new line.

Final answer should be just the name of the book: "House of Leaves".

To be thorough, let me double-check if there's any other book by him released on that date. From what I know, "House of Leaves" is his debut novel and the most prominent one. He has other works, but they came later, like "Only Revolutions" in 2006.

So, I'm confident with this.
