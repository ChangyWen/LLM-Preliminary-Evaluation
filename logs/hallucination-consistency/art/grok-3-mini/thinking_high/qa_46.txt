*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Haruki Murakami that was released on 2009-05-29. I need to recall or know which book that is.

Haruki Murakami is a well-known Japanese author. Some of his famous books include "Norwegian Wood," "Kafka on the Shore," "1Q84," and "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle." I need to pinpoint the one released on May 29, 2009.

The date given is 2009-05-29, which is May 29, 2009. I should think about which book was published around that time.

I remember that "1Q84" is one of his major works. Let me confirm the release date. I think "1Q84" was published in Japan in 2009. Specifically, the first volume might have been released on May 29, 2009.

Upon thinking, yes, "1Q84" by Haruki Murakami was indeed released in Japan on May 29, 2009. It's a very famous book, often considered one of his masterpieces.

To be thorough, I should make sure there aren't other books by him released on that exact date. Murakami's books are usually released in Japan first, and "1Q84" is a trilogy, but the initial release was in 2009.

The user specified "created by Haruki Murakami," which matches, and "famous book," which "1Q84" certainly is.

Now, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start by confirming the details and then state the answer.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

So, the book is "1Q84".
