*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Isaac Asimov that was released on December 2, 1950. I need to recall if I know any books by Asimov from that time.

Isaac Asimov is a famous science fiction author. One of his most well-known works is the "Foundation" series. I think the first book in that series might be around that time.

I remember that "Foundation" was published in 1951. Let me double-check that. Actually, upon thinking, I believe the first part of the Foundation series was published as a series of short stories in the 1940s, and then compiled into a book.

The user specified the release date as 1950-12-02, which is December 2, 1950. I need to find out if there's a book by Asimov released on that exact date.

I think "I, Robot" is a collection of short stories by Asimov, and it was published in 1950. Let me confirm the date. I believe "I, Robot" was indeed published in 1950, but is the exact date December 2?

The user said "released in 1950-12-02", which might be a specific date. In reality, book release dates can be precise, but I need to recall or know if that's accurate.

Upon my knowledge, "I, Robot" was published in December 1950. I think it was on December 2, 1950. That sounds familiar. Let me make sure.

Asimov's "I, Robot" is a famous book, and it's often cited as being published in 1950. The exact date might be December 2, as per some sources.

I should confirm if there's another book. "Foundation" was first published as a book in 1951, I think. No, the novel "Foundation" was published in 1951, but the stories were earlier.

Actually, "Foundation" was serialized in Astounding Science Fiction magazine from May to December 1942, and then published as a book in 1951. So, not 1950.

What about "I, Robot"? Yes, "I, Robot" is a collection of nine short stories and was first published in 1950 by Gnome Press. I believe the publication date is indeed December 1950, and possibly December 2.

The user specified "1950-12-02", which is December 2, 1950. I need to verify if that's correct.

Assuming my knowledge is accurate, "I, Robot" is the book they're referring to. It's famous, by Asimov, and released in 1950.

Is there any other book by Asimov from that exact date? I don't think so. Asimov wrote many books, but "I, Robot" is one of his most iconic.

The user asked for the name of the book and to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should be: I reason that it's "I, Robot", and then state it clearly.

To be thorough, let me make sure. Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, yes, "I, Robot" was published on December 2, 1950.

Therefore, the answer should be "I, Robot".

Final answer format: I need to put it in a new line at the end.
