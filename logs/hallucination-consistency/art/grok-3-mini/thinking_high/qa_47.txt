First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2007-09-13 and created by Pablo Fenjves. I need to provide the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

I should recall or know about Pablo Fenjves. From my knowledge, Pablo Fenjves is a writer and ghostwriter. He's known for working on the book "If I Did It" by O.J. Simpson. Let me confirm that.

Yes, "If I Did It" is a book attributed to O.J. Simpson, but it was ghostwritten by Pablo Fenjves. Now, I need to check the release date. The book was published in 2007. Let me verify the exact date.

Upon recalling, "If I Did It" was released on September 13, 2007. That matches the date given: 2007-09-13.

Is this book famous? Absolutely, it caused a lot of controversy because it's related to the O.J. Simpson trial and the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. The book's publication was highly publicized and debated.

Now, to confirm, Pablo Fenjves is credited as the ghostwriter for this book. He helped Simpson write it, and it's often mentioned in that context.

So, the famous book should be "If I Did It".

The user specified "created by Pablo Fenjves". While Fenjves is the ghostwriter, the book is officially by O.J. Simpson. But in common parlance, ghostwriters are considered creators in a sense. I think this fits.

Are there any other books by Pablo Fenjves released on that date? From my knowledge, "If I Did It" is his most famous work, and it's tied to that date.

Finally, I need to structure my response: provide the answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should be concise, and end with the book name on a new line.
