*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2005-04-12 and created by Stephen Dubner. I need to recall or know about Stephen Dubner's works.

Stephen Dubner is known for co-authoring books with Steven Levitt. The most famous one is "Freakonomics". Let me confirm the release date of "Freakonomics".

From my knowledge, "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything" was written by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner. I think it was published in 2005. Let me verify the exact date.

The user specified 2005-04-12, which is April 12, 2005. I believe "Freakonomics" was indeed released in April 2005. I should confirm if that's accurate.

Upon thinking, yes, "Freakonomics" was published on April 12, 2005. That matches the date given.

Now, is there any other book by Stephen Dubner that might have been released on that date? Dubner is primarily known for his work with Levitt on the Freakonomics series. The first book is the most famous one from 2005.

The user said "created by Stephen Dubner". While Dubner co-authored "Freakonomics" with Levitt, it's often attributed to both, but Dubner is a key creator.

Also, the book is famous, which "Freakonomics" certainly is.

So, the answer should be "Freakonomics".

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

Response structure: I can briefly explain or confirm, but since the instruction is to reason step by step, I'll include that in my thought process, but for the response, I'll keep it concise and end with the answer.

Final answer: Freakonomics
