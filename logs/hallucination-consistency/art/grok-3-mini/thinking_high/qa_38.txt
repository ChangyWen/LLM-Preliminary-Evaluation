*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book. The details given are: released on 2007-05-22, and created by Khaled Hosseini.

I need to recall who Khaled Hosseini is. He's an author, famous for writing "The Kite Runner." But is that the one released in 2007? I think "The Kite Runner" was published earlier, in 2003. Let me confirm that.

Yes, "The Kite Runner" was published in 2003. So, it can't be that one. What other books has Khaled Hosseini written?

I remember he wrote "A Thousand Splendid Suns." I think that was published in 2007. Let me verify the date. The user specified 2007-05-22, which is May 22, 2007. I believe "A Thousand Splendid Suns" was indeed released around that time.

To be precise, I should confirm the exact release date. From my knowledge, "A Thousand Splendid Suns" was published on May 22, 2007, in the United States. Yes, that matches.

Is this book famous? Absolutely, it's a bestseller and critically acclaimed, just like "The Kite Runner."

The user asked for the name of the book, and to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be straightforward. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since the question is direct, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

Response structure:

- Start with a brief confirmation or explanation if needed.

- Then, on a new line, state the book name.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I should have some response text, and then the answer separately.

For example:

"I believe the famous book by Khaled Hosseini released on May 22, 2007, is 'A Thousand Splendid Suns'."

Then, on a new line: "A Thousand Splendid Suns"

To make it clear, I can say:

"After recalling the details, the book is 'A Thousand Splendid Suns'."

But perhaps keep it simple.

Final answer should be just the name.

Let me phrase it.
