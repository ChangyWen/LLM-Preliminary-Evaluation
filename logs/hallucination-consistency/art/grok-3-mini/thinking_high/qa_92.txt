*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book. The details given are: released on 2016-05-10, and created by Garrard Conley.

I need to recall or know about books by Garrard Conley. I think Garrard Conley is an author, and I believe he wrote a memoir about his experiences with conversion therapy. The book is called "Boy Erased."

Let me confirm the release date. The user specified 2016-05-10, which is May 10, 2016. I should verify if "Boy Erased" was indeed released on that date.

From my knowledge, "Boy Erased: A Memoir" by Garrard Conley was published in 2016. I think it was released in May 2016. Let me make sure about the exact date. Upon thinking, I recall that it was published on May 10, 2016, in the US.

Is it famous? Yes, "Boy Erased" became well-known, especially after it was adapted into a film in 2018 starring Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe. So, it fits the description of being famous.

Now, the user asked for the name of the book, and to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be straightforward. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a direct question, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Structure my response:

- Start with a brief acknowledgment or confirmation.

- Then, end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer should be: Boy Erased

To be precise, the full title is "Boy Erased: A Memoir."

But the user asked for "the name of the famous book," so "Boy Erased" should suffice, but including the subtitle might be accurate.

Looking back at the question: "What is the name of the famous book..." and it's specified by author and date, so "Boy Erased" is clear.

Ensure there are no other books by Garrard Conley released on that date. From my knowledge, "Boy Erased" is his debut book, and it's the one from 2016.

So, I'm confident with this.
