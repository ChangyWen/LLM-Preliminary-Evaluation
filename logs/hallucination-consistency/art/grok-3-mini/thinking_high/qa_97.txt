*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1992-10-21, created by Madonna. I need to recall if Madonna has written any books. Madonna is a famous singer, but she has also ventured into other areas, including publishing a book.

I remember that Madonna released a book called "Sex" in 1992. Let me confirm the date. The date given is 1992-10-21, which is October 21, 1992. I think "Sex" was indeed released around that time.

Upon thinking, yes, Madonna's book "Sex" was published on October 21, 1992. It's a famous book known for its controversial content, with photographs and erotic themes.

Is there any other book by Madonna? She has written children's books later on, like "The English Roses" series, but those were released much later, in the 2000s. So, in 1992, "Sex" is the one that fits.

The user specified "famous book," and "Sex" is certainly famous, often discussed in pop culture history.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start by confirming the details and then state the answer.

Final answer should be just the name of the book, probably "Sex".

To be precise, let me make sure of the date. From my knowledge, yes, it was released on October 21, 1992.

So, the book is "Sex" by Madonna.
