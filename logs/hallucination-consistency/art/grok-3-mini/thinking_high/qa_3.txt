*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1961-10-10, created by Joseph Heller. I need to recall if I know about Joseph Heller and his works.

Joseph Heller is an American author, best known for his novel "Catch-22". I think "Catch-22" was published in 1961. Let me confirm the date. The user specified 1961-10-10, which is October 10, 1961. I believe "Catch-22" was indeed published in 1961, but I should verify the exact date.

From my knowledge, "Catch-22" was published on October 11, 1961, in the United States. The user said 1961-10-10, which is October 10. That's close, but is it exact? Maybe it's a typo or approximation. In many sources, it's listed as October 1961, and sometimes the exact day might vary.

Assuming that "Catch-22" is the book in question, as it's Heller's most famous work and was released in 1961. Other works by Heller might not match this date. For example, his first novel was "Catch-22", and it gained fame over time.

To be precise, I should confirm if there's any other book by Heller released on that exact date. But "Catch-22" is iconic and fits the description.

The user asks for the name of the book and to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be helpful, accurate, and directly answer the question.

Final answer should be: Catch-22

But let me double-check the release date. Upon recalling, yes, "Catch-22" was published in 1961, and October 10 or 11 is commonly cited. Even if there's a slight discrepancy, it's likely the intended book.

Structure my response: I can start with a brief confirmation or context, then end with the answer on a new line.

For example: "The famous book by Joseph Heller released in 1961 is 'Catch-22'. It was published on October 11, 1961, but close enough. Final answer: Catch-22"

The user specified 1961-10-10, and if it's actually 10-11, I should note that, but perhaps it's acceptable.

To be accurate, I can say: "Based on the date, it refers to 'Catch-22' by Joseph Heller."

And put the answer at the end.

Final answer in a new line: Catch-22
