*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2001-09-11, created by Yann Martel. I need to recall if I know about Yann Martel's books.

Yann Martel is a Canadian author, and he's most famous for his book "Life of Pi." I think "Life of Pi" was published in 2001. Let me confirm the date. The user specified 2001-09-11, which is September 11, 2001. That's the same date as the 9/11 attacks, but I don't think that's relevant here. I need to check if "Life of Pi" was indeed released on that exact date.

From my knowledge, "Life of Pi" was published in September 2001. I believe it was released on September 11, 2001, in some regions. Yes, that sounds familiar. It's a well-known fact that the book was published on the same day as the 9/11 attacks, which might have affected its initial reception.

The book is indeed famous; it won the Man Booker Prize in 2002 and was adapted into a successful film.

So, the book should be "Life of Pi."

Now, the user asked for the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly. I should probably give a brief confirmation or explanation before stating the answer.

Let me outline my response:

- Start with a direct answer or a confirmation.

- Then, end with the answer on a new line.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I should have some text before, and then the answer separately.

Also, ensure that the answer is just the name of the book, probably "Life of Pi."

Is there any other book by Yann Martel released on that date? I don't think so. "Life of Pi" is his most famous work, and it was published in 2001. His other books like "The High Mountains of Portugal" came later.

Confirm the date: Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, "Life of Pi" was first published on September 11, 2001, in Canada.

So, I'm confident with this.

Final response structure:

- I can say something like: "The famous book by Yann Martel released on September 11, 2001, is Life of Pi."

- Then, on a new line, just "Life of Pi" as the final answer.

To make it clear, I should have a sentence or two, and then the answer.

Since the user specified "final answer in a new line," I'll do that.
