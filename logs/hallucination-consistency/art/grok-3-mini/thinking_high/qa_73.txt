First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2010-03-15, created by Michael Lewis. I need to recall or know what book that is.

Michael Lewis is a well-known author. Some of his famous books include "Moneyball", "The Big Short", "Liar's Poker", and "Flash Boys". I need to check which one was released on March 15, 2010.

I think "The Big Short" was published around that time. Let me confirm the release date. From my knowledge, "The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine" was indeed published in 2010. I believe the exact date is March 15, 2010.

Yes, that sounds right. "The Big Short" is a famous book that deals with the financial crisis of 2008, and it was adapted into a movie later on.

Now, to make sure, let's think about other books by Michael Lewis. "Moneyball" was published in 2003, so that's earlier. "Liar's Poker" was in 1989. "Flash Boys" was in 2014, which is later. So, 2010 should be "The Big Short".

The user specified the date 2010-03-15, which is March 15, 2010. I should confirm if that's accurate. Based on standard knowledge, yes.

The user asks for the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly. I shouldn't just blurt out the answer; I can provide a bit of context, but keep it concise.

Finally, the answer should be just the book name on a new line.

So, my response could be: I recall that Michael Lewis released "The Big Short" on March 15, 2010. It's a famous book about the financial crisis.

Then, on a new line: The Big Short

To be precise, the book title is "The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine".

But in common reference, it's often just called "The Big Short".

I think that's correct.
