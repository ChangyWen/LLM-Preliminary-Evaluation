*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2013-10-10, created by Greg Sestero. I need to recall or know about Greg Sestero and his works.

Greg Sestero is known for his involvement in the movie "The Room," which is often called one of the worst movies ever made. He co-wrote a book about the making of that film.

The book is called "The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made." I believe that's the one.

Now, the release date given is 2013-10-10. I need to confirm if that's the correct release date for "The Disaster Artist."

From my knowledge, "The Disaster Artist" by Greg Sestero was indeed published in 2013. I think October 10, 2013, sounds familiar. Let me double-check that.

Assuming my knowledge is up to date, I recall that the book was released in October 2013. Specifically, October 10, 2013, matches what I know.

The book became famous, especially after it was adapted into a movie in 2017 starring James Franco, which won awards and brought more attention to it.

So, the famous book is "The Disaster Artist."

The user specified "created by Greg Sestero." While Greg Sestero wrote it, he co-wrote it with Tom Bissell. But the book is primarily attributed to Sestero.

The date 2013-10-10 is likely October 10, 2013, in YYYY-MM-DD format.

I don't think Greg Sestero has other famous books. "The Disaster Artist" is his most well-known work.

Finally, the user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be straightforward, and end with the answer on a new line.
