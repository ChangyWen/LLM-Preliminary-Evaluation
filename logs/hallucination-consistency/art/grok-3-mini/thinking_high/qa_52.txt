First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 19, 1988, created by Thomas Harris.

I need to recall who Thomas Harris is. He's the author of "The Silence of the Lambs," which is a famous book and was adapted into a movie.

Now, I need to confirm the release date of "The Silence of the Lambs." I think it was published in 1988. Let me verify that. Yes, according to my knowledge, "The Silence of the Lambs" by Thomas Harris was published in 1988.

The user specified the exact date: May 19, 1988. I should check if that's accurate. From what I remember, the book was indeed released in 1988, but I'm not sure about the exact day. However, since the user provided that date, and it's a specific query, I'll assume that's correct or that it's the release date.

Thomas Harris's famous works include:

- "Red Dragon" (1981)

- "The Silence of the Lambs" (1988)

- "Hannibal" (1999)

- "Hannibal Rising" (2006)

So, in 1988, "The Silence of the Lambs" is the one that matches.

Now, is May 19, 1988, the correct release date? I don't have real-time access to verify, but based on common knowledge, "The Silence of the Lambs" was published in 1988, and it's plausible that the date is correct. If I'm unsure, I should go with what I know.

The user said "famous book," and "The Silence of the Lambs" is indeed very famous, winning awards and being adapted into an Oscar-winning film.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "The famous book released on May 19, 1988, by Thomas Harris is 'The Silence of the Lambs'."

Then, put the final answer on a new line.
