First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 19, 1952, created by John Steinbeck. I need to recall if John Steinbeck wrote a book released on that specific date.

John Steinbeck is a famous author, known for books like "The Grapes of Wrath," "Of Mice and Men," and "East of Eden." I think "East of Eden" was published in 1952. Let me confirm the date.

From my knowledge, "East of Eden" was indeed published in 1952. Now, the user specified the exact date: September 19, 1952. I need to verify if that's accurate.

Upon thinking, I recall that "East of Eden" was published on September 19, 1952. That sounds familiar. It's one of Steinbeck's major works, and it's famous.

To be thorough, let me make sure there aren't other books by Steinbeck released around that time. Steinbeck's bibliography includes:

- "The Grapes of Wrath" (1939)

- "Of Mice and Men" (1937)

- "East of Eden" (1952)

- "The Winter of Our Discontent" (1961)

- Etc.

So, 1952 is specifically associated with "East of Eden." And the date September 19 is correct for its publication.

The user asked for the name of the book, and to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward question, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

So, the book is "East of Eden."
