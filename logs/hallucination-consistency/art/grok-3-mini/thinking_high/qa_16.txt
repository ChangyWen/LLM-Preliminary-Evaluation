*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2015-05-26 and created by Jenny Han. I need to recall or know about Jenny Han's books.

Jenny Han is an author known for young adult fiction. Some of her famous works include the "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" series. Let me think about the release dates.

The book "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" was released in 2014. That doesn't match 2015-05-26. So, it might be a sequel or another book.

I think the sequel is "P.S. I Still Love You." I believe that was released in 2015. Let me confirm the date. From my knowledge, "P.S. I Still Love You" was published on May 26, 2015. That matches the date given: 2015-05-26.

Is this book famous? Yes, it's part of a popular series that was adapted into a Netflix movie, so it's well-known.

Jenny Han has other books, like "The Summer I Turned Pretty" series, but I think that was released earlier or later. "The Summer I Turned Pretty" was first published in 2009, so not in 2015.

Confirming the date: 2015-05-26 is May 26, 2015. And "P.S. I Still Love You" was indeed released on that date.

The user specified "famous book," and this one fits. There might be other books by Jenny Han, but this seems to be the one that matches the date.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start by confirming the details and then state the answer.

Final answer: P.S. I Still Love You

Make sure the format is correct. The user said "in a new line at the end," so I'll write a sentence or two, and then on a new line, just the book name.

Response structure:

- Acknowledge the query.

- Provide the answer clearly.

- End with the book name on a new line.
