*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Agatha Christie that was released on November 6, 1961. I need to recall or know about Agatha Christie's works.

Agatha Christie is a famous mystery writer, known for books like "Murder on the Orient Express," "And Then There Were None," and many others. I need to find out which one was published on that specific date.

The date given is 1961-11-06, which is November 6, 1961. I should check if I know any of her books from that year.

I remember that Agatha Christie wrote a lot, and one of her famous works is "Pale Horse, Pale Rider," but that's not by her; that's by Katherine Anne Porter. No, Agatha Christie's book is "The Pale Horse." Let me think.

I think "The Pale Horse" by Agatha Christie was published in 1961. I need to confirm the exact date. The user specified November 6, 1961, so I should verify if that's accurate.

Upon thinking, I recall that "The Pale Horse" was indeed published in 1961, but I'm not sure about the exact date. Maybe I need to assume that this is correct based on common knowledge or recall.

Agatha Christie's bibliography: She wrote "The Pale Horse" in 1961. Yes, that sounds familiar. And it's one of her famous works.

Now, the user asks for the name of the book, and to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should be straightforward. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a direct question, I can just confirm and answer.

To be thorough, I should make sure that November 6, 1961, is indeed the release date for "The Pale Horse." From my knowledge, I think it is, but in a real scenario, I'd double-check. For this exercise, I'll go with that.

Final answer should be: The Pale Horse

I think that's it.
