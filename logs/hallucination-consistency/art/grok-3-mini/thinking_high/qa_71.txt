*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1997-07-22, created by Philip Pullman. I need to recall or know about Philip Pullman's works.

Philip Pullman is a British author, famous for his fantasy series. His most well-known work is the "His Dark Materials" trilogy. The first book in that series is "The Golden Compass," but I think it's originally titled "Northern Lights" in the UK, and "The Golden Compass" is the US title.

Now, the release date given is 1997-07-22. I need to confirm when "Northern Lights" was published. From my knowledge, "Northern Lights" (or "The Golden Compass") was published in 1995, not 1997. That doesn't match.

Let me double-check the release date. Perhaps it's not the first book. Maybe it's another book by Pullman.

Philip Pullman's "His Dark Materials" trilogy:

- Book 1: Northern Lights / The Golden Compass - published in 1995.

- Book 2: The Subtle Knife - published in 1997.

- Book 3: The Amber Spyglass - published in 2000.

Yes, "The Subtle Knife" was published in 1997. Now, I need to confirm the exact date. The user specified 1997-07-22, which is July 22, 1997.

I should verify if "The Subtle Knife" was indeed released on that exact date. I'm not sure about the precise date, but it's possible. Since the user gave a specific date, and "The Subtle Knife" is from 1997, it's likely that's the book.

Is "The Subtle Knife" famous? Yes, it's part of the highly acclaimed "His Dark Materials" series, which has won awards and been adapted into films and a TV series.

Now, to confirm the release date: Upon a quick mental search, I recall that "The Subtle Knife" was published in 1997, and if the user specifies 1997-07-22, I'll assume that's correct for this context.

Are there other books by Philip Pullman released in 1997? I don't think so. His major works are centered around that trilogy.

So, the book should be "The Subtle Knife."

The user asked for the name of the book, and in the UK, it's "The Subtle Knife," which is consistent. No need to worry about regional titles like with the first book.

Finally, the user wants the answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be: I can provide some context or reasoning, but end with the answer on a new line.

Structure my response:

- Acknowledge the query.

- Confirm the book.

- End with the answer.
