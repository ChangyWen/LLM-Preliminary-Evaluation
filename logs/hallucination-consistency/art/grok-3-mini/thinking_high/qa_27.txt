*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 27, 1959, created by Richard Condon. I need to recall or know about Richard Condon's works.

Richard Condon is an author, and one of his most famous books is "The Manchurian Candidate." I think that was published in 1959. Let me confirm the date.

I believe "The Manchurian Candidate" was indeed published in 1959. Now, the specific date given is April 27, 1959. I should verify if that's accurate.

From my knowledge, "The Manchurian Candidate" is a well-known novel, later adapted into films, and it's associated with Richard Condon. I think the publication date is 1959, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact day, April 27.

Since the user specified the date, I should assume that's correct or check if it matches. In reality, I don't have real-time access to databases, so I'll rely on general knowledge.

Upon thinking, I recall that "The Manchurian Candidate" was published in 1959, and it's possible that April 27 is the exact date. If it's a famous book and matches the description, that's likely it.

Are there other books by Richard Condon from 1959? I think "The Manchurian Candidate" is his most famous work, and it's from that year. Other works might not be as prominent.

So, probably, the answer is "The Manchurian Candidate."

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "Based on the information, the famous book by Richard Condon released on April 27, 1959, is 'The Manchurian Candidate'."

Then, end with the answer on a new line.

Finally, box the answer as per the instruction, but the user didn't specify boxing, but in the context, I think it's for the final answer.

Looking back: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I'll write a brief response and then the answer on a new line.
