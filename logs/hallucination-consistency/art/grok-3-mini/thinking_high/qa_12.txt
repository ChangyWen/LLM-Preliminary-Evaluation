*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book. The details given are: released on 2003-05-29, and created by Khaled Hosseini.

I need to recall who Khaled Hosseini is. He's an author, and his most famous book is "The Kite Runner." I think that's the one that was published around that time.

Let me confirm the release date. I believe "The Kite Runner" was published in 2003. The date given is 2003-05-29, which is May 29, 2003. I should verify if that's accurate.

From my knowledge, "The Kite Runner" was indeed published in 2003. I think it was a bestseller and made Hosseini famous.

Now, are there any other books by Khaled Hosseini? He has written others like "A Thousand Splendid Suns" and "And the Mountains Echoed," but those were published later. "A Thousand Splendid Suns" was in 2007, and "And the Mountains Echoed" in 2013. So, in 2003, "The Kite Runner" should be the one.

The date is specific: 2003-05-29. I should make sure that this matches the release date of "The Kite Runner." Upon thinking, I recall that "The Kite Runner" was first published in the US on May 29, 2003. Yes, that sounds right.

The user says "famous book," and "The Kite Runner" is indeed very famous. It's been adapted into a film and is widely read.

So, the answer should be "The Kite Runner."

The user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or just state it, but since it's a straightforward question, I don't need to add much fluff.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

Response structure:

- Optionally, a short intro or confirmation.

- Then, the answer on a new line.
