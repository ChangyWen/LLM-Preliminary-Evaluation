*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2013-10-10, created by Tom Bissell. I need to recall or know about Tom Bissell's works.

Tom Bissell is a writer, known for non-fiction, essays, and video game-related writing. He's written books like "Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter" and "The Father of All Things."

The specific release date given is 2013-10-10, which is October 10, 2013. I need to think about what book he might have released around that time.

I recall that Tom Bissell co-wrote a book with Jeff Alexander. Let me think: one of his notable works is "The Disaster Artist," but that's by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell? No, "The Disaster Artist" is primarily by Greg Sestero, and Tom Bissell helped with the adaptation or something, but I think Bissell co-wrote the book version.

Upon thinking, I believe Tom Bissell co-authored "The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made" with Greg Sestero. Now, when was that released?

I think "The Disaster Artist" was published in 2013. Let me confirm the date. The user specified 2013-10-10, so perhaps that's the release date.

After a quick mental search, yes, "The Disaster Artist" by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell was indeed released in 2013. I think the exact date might be October 10, 2013, but I'm not 100% sure. It could be close.

The user said "created by Tom Bissell," but technically, it's co-authored. However, in common parlance, he is credited as a co-creator.

Is there another book by Tom Bissell released on that exact date? I'm not aware of any other major works by him in 2013.

Tom Bissell's other books: "Chasing the Sea" (2003), "Extra Lives" (2010), and then "The Father of All Things" (2007). So, 2013 seems to align with "The Disaster Artist."

Moreover, "The Disaster Artist" became famous, especially after the movie adaptation in 2017, which won awards.

So, it's likely that this is the book in question.

Now, the user asks for the name of the book and to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

My response should be concise, and end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer should be: The Disaster Artist

To be precise, the full title is "The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made" by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell.

But the user said "created by Tom Bissell," so I should just give the name as commonly known.

I think "The Disaster Artist" is sufficient.

Confirm the release date: Upon double-checking my knowledge, I believe it was published in October 2013, and 10/10/2013 could be the date.

If I'm wrong, another possibility: Did Tom Bissell release something else? I think he might have written articles or other works, but a famous book on that date should be this one.

I'll go with that.
