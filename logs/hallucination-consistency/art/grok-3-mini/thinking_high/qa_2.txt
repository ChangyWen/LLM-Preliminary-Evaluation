*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Dean Koontz that was released on May 10, 1981. I need to recall or know about Dean Koontz's bibliography.

Dean Koontz is a well-known author, especially in the thriller, horror, and suspense genres. Some of his famous books include "Watchers," "Intensity," "Odd Thomas," but I need to find one specifically released on May 10, 1981.

I should think about his books from around that time. 1981 is relatively early in his career. I know he started writing in the 1960s or 1970s. Let me recall some titles.

One book that comes to mind is "The Voice of the Night," but I'm not sure about the release date. Another is "Whispers," which I think was published in the early 1980s.

I need to be precise. The user specified the exact date: May 10, 1981. So, I should try to remember or infer which book that is.

Upon thinking, I believe Dean Koontz's book "The Funhouse" was published in 1980, but that's not 1981. "Whispers" was published in 1980 as well. Let me double-check my knowledge.

Actually, I think "The Eyes of Darkness" was published in 1981, but I'm not sure about the exact date. "The Voice of the Night" might be from 1980 or 1981.

Perhaps it's "Howling Mad," but that doesn't sound right. Dean Koontz has written under pseudonyms too, but the user specified "created by Dean Koontz," so probably under his real name.

Let me try to recall accurately. I think "Whispers" was his breakthrough novel, published in 1980. For 1981, I believe he published "The Mask" or something else.

I should consider that the user might be referring to a specific book. Upon searching my memory, I recall that Dean Koontz's book "The Voice of the Night" was published in 1980, but maybe there's another one.

Perhaps it's "The Key to Midnight," but that was written under a pseudonym and later republished.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to assume that the book is "Whispers," but it was 1980. The user said 1981-05-10, which is May 10, 1981.

Let me think differently. Perhaps it's "The House of Thunder," but that was 1982.

I think I have it: Dean Koontz's book "The Door to December" was published in 1985, not 1981.

Maybe "Darkfall" in 1984.

Perhaps the user has the date wrong, but I need to answer based on the query.

Upon further reflection, I believe Dean Koontz's book "The Voice of the Night" was actually published in 1980, but let's confirm the date.

I think there might be a book called "The Funhouse," which is a novelization, published in 1980.

Perhaps it's "Whispers," and the date is approximate.

But the user specified May 10, 1981, so I need to find a book with that release date.

After thinking, I recall that Dean Koontz's book "The Key to Midnight" was first published in 1979 under the pseudonym Leigh Nichols, and later republished under his name, but not in 1981.

This is confusing. Maybe I should consider that the famous book is "Whispers," and the date might be a mistake, but I have to go with the information given.

Perhaps it's "The Vision," which was published in 1977.

Let's list some of his books:

- 1976: Midnight

No, "Midnight" is 1989.

Early works: "Star Quest" in 1968, but that's science fiction.

In 1981, I think he published "The Face of Fear," but that was 1977.

Upon accurate recollection, I believe Dean Koontz's book "The Voice of the Night" was published on May 12, 1980, not 1981. Close but not exact.

Perhaps the user meant 1980, or maybe it's a different book.

Another book: "Shattered," published in 1973.

I think I found it: Dean Koontz's book "The Servants of Twilight" was published in 1984.

This is not helping. Maybe I need to admit that I'm not sure, but as an AI, I should provide the most likely answer.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, I recall that Dean Koontz's book "Whispers" was published in December 1980, and perhaps there's a paperback edition or something in 1981.

But the date is specific: May 10, 1981.

After thinking, I believe the book might be "The Mask," which was published in 1981. Let me confirm: "The Mask" by Dean Koontz was published in 1981.

Yes, I think "The Mask" was released in 1981. And it could be on May 10.

I'm not sure about the exact date, but it's a possibility.

"The Eyes of Darkness" was first published in 1981 under the title "The Servants of Twilight" or something? No, "The Eyes of Darkness" was 1981.

Upon accurate memory, "The Eyes of Darkness" by Dean Koontz was published in 1981. And it might be the one.

Let me confirm: "The Eyes of Darkness" is a novel by Dean Koontz, first published in 1981.

And it could be on May 10, 1981. I'm not 100% sure about the date, but it's a famous book by him from that year.

Another book is "The Voice of the Night," but that's 1980.

So, probably "The Eyes of Darkness" is the answer.

But is it famous? It's one of his works, and it has gained popularity, especially with themes of prophecy and such.

Perhaps "Whispers" is more famous, but date doesn't match.

I think "The Eyes of Darkness" is the correct one.

So, I'll go with that.
