*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1990-05-10, created by Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman. I know that Neil Gaiman is a well-known author, and his full name is Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman, so that matches.

Now, I need to recall what book he released on May 10, 1990. I'm familiar with Neil Gaiman's works. Some of his famous books include "The Sandman" series, but that's a comic book series, not a single book release. "The Sandman" started in 1989, but the specific issue or volume might not align with a date like 1990-05-10.

Perhaps it's a specific graphic novel or a collection. But the user says "book," so it could be a novel or a graphic novel.

Let me think about his bibliography. In 1990, Neil Gaiman was working on "The Sandman," which was serialized in comics. The first issue of "The Sandman" was released in 1989, and by 1990, more issues were coming out.

But the date given is 1990-05-10, which is May 10, 1990. I need to find out if there's a specific book or issue released on that exact date.

Maybe it's not "The Sandman." Let me recall other works. His first novel was "Good Omens," co-written with Terry Pratchett, but that was published in 1990. When was "Good Omens" released?

I think "Good Omens" was published in May 1990. Let me confirm the exact date. I believe it was released on May 10, 1990, in the UK. That sounds familiar.

Yes, upon my knowledge, "Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch" by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett was first published on May 10, 1990.

Is that exact date correct? I'm pretty sure it's around that time. Let me double-check my internal knowledge.

Neil Gaiman has confirmed in interviews that "Good Omens" was published in 1990, and I think the specific date is May 10.

Moreover, it's a famous book, which matches the query.

Now, the user specified "created by Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman," which is his full name, so it's correct.

Other possibilities: Was there another book by him in 1990? I don't think so. "The Sandman" is a series, and while individual issues might have been released on that date, it's not typically referred to as a "book" in the same way a novel is.

"Good Omens" is a standalone novel and very famous.

So, I believe the answer is "Good Omens."

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should lead up to it and then state the answer clearly.
