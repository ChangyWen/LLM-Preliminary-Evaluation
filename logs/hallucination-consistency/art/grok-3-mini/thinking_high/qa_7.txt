*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Stephen King that was released on 2013-09-24. I need to recall or know which book that is.

Stephen King is a well-known author, and he has written many books. The date given is 2013-09-24, which is September 24, 2013. I need to think about what book he released on that specific date.

I remember that Stephen King released a book called "Doctor Sleep" in 2013. Let me confirm the release date. I think "Doctor Sleep" is the sequel to "The Shining," and it was published in 2013. Is the exact date September 24?

Upon thinking, I believe "Doctor Sleep" was indeed released on September 24, 2013. That sounds familiar. It's one of his famous works.

To be thorough, I should make sure there aren't other books by Stephen King released on that date. Stephen King typically releases one major book per year, and 2013 is associated with "Doctor Sleep."

Let me double-check my knowledge: "Doctor Sleep" was published in 2013, and I think the release date is correct. It's a famous book, as it's a continuation of a popular story.

The user specified "famous book," and "Doctor Sleep" fits that description. It's well-known among King fans and was a bestseller.

Now, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly. I should probably just state the answer clearly without additional fluff, but since this is a response, I can have a bit of reasoning, but keep it concise.

Finally, the answer should be: Doctor Sleep

I think that's it.
