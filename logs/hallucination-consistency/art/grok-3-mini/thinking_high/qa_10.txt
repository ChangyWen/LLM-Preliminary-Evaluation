First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 15, 1977, created by J. R. R. Tolkien.

I know J. R. R. Tolkien is the author of "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Hobbit." I need to recall if there's a book by him released on that specific date.

Tolkien passed away in 1973, so he didn't release any books after that. The date given is 1977-09-15, which is after his death. That means the book might have been published posthumously.

I remember that "The Silmarillion" was published after Tolkien's death. Let me confirm the release date. I think "The Silmarillion" was edited by his son Christopher Tolkien and published in 1977.

Yes, "The Silmarillion" was released on September 15, 1977. That matches the date given.

Is it famous? Absolutely, it's a key part of Tolkien's legendarium and is well-known among fans.

The user specified "created by J. R. R. Tolkien," which is true, as he wrote the content, even though it was compiled and edited posthumously.

Now, the user asks for the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief explanation and then give the answer.

Final answer should be just the book name on a new line.

So, the book is "The Silmarillion."
