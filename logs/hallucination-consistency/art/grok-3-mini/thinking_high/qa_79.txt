*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2005-04-12 and created by Stephen Dubner. I need to recall or know about Stephen Dubner's works.

Stephen Dubner is known for co-authoring books with Steven Levitt. The most famous one is "Freakonomics". Let me confirm the release date and the author.

"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything" was written by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner. Now, I need to check the release date. I think it was published in 2005. Let me verify the exact date.

Upon my knowledge, "Freakonomics" was indeed published in April 2005. I believe the exact date is April 12, 2005. That matches the date given: 2005-04-12.

Is there any other book by Stephen Dubner that might fit this description? Dubner is primarily known for "Freakonomics" and its sequels, but "Freakonomics" is the most famous one from 2005.

Let me double-check: Stephen Dubner co-authored "Freakonomics" with Steven Levitt, and it was a bestseller. The release date is correct.

The user said "created by Stephen Dubner". While Dubner is a co-author, it's accurate to say he created it as part of the team. No other solo works by Dubner are as famous or match the date.

So, the book should be "Freakonomics".

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, but since the instruction is to give the final answer at the end, I'll keep it concise.

Final answer: Freakonomics

I should make sure the format is correct. The user said "in a new line at the end", so I'll write something like:

After reasoning, the famous book is Freakonomics.

But to follow the instruction precisely, I'll put it in a new line.

Also, ensure that the answer is accurate. Upon quick search in my knowledge base, yes, "Freakonomics" was published on April 12, 2005.
