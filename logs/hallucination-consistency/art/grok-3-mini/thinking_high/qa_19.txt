*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on January 17, 1966, created by Truman Capote. I need to recall if I know about Truman Capote and his works.

Truman Capote is a famous American author known for books like "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and "In Cold Blood." "In Cold Blood" is a non-fiction novel that I think was published around that time.

I remember that "In Cold Blood" was published in 1966. Let me confirm the exact date. The user specified January 17, 1966. Is that accurate?

Upon thinking, I believe "In Cold Blood" was indeed published in 1966, but I'm not sure about the exact date. I should verify this based on my knowledge.

From what I know, "In Cold Blood" is Truman Capote's most famous work, and it was released in 1966. It's often cited as a groundbreaking work in the true crime genre.

Now, the user mentioned the specific date: January 17, 1966. I need to check if that's correct. In my training data, I recall that "In Cold Blood" was serialized in The New Yorker magazine starting in 1965, and then published as a book in 1966. I think the book was released on January 17, 1966. That sounds familiar.

To confirm, Truman Capote's other famous work, "Breakfast at Tiffany's," was published in 1958, so it's not that one. "In Cold Blood" is the one from 1966.

The user asks for the name of the book and to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be straightforward: I can say something like, "The famous book released on January 17, 1966, by Truman Capote is 'In Cold Blood'."

Then, end with the answer on a new line.

Finally, box the answer as per the instruction, but since this is a response, I'll just write it clearly.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I need to have the answer on a new line.

Also, ensure that it's accurate. Based on standard knowledge, "In Cold Blood" was published on January 17, 1966.

I think that's correct. I'm confident with that.
