*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2018-01-16 and created by Jordan Peterson. I need to recall if I know about Jordan Peterson and his books.

Jordan Peterson is a Canadian psychologist and author. He's known for his book "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos." I think that's the one that was released around that time.

Now, the date given is 2018-01-16. I need to confirm if that's the release date for "12 Rules for Life." From my knowledge, "12 Rules for Life" was published in January 2018. Let me think about the exact date.

Upon recalling, I believe "12 Rules for Life" was released on January 23, 2018, in Canada and the US. The user said 2018-01-16, which is January 16, 2018. That's close but not exactly the same. Maybe it's a typo or approximation.

I should double-check the exact release date. Based on standard knowledge, "12 Rules for Life" is indeed the book in question. Jordan Peterson's other famous book is "Maps of Meaning," but that was published much earlier, in 1999. So, it can't be that one.

Confirming the release date: After a quick mental search, I think "12 Rules for Life" was released on January 23, 2018. The user said January 16, which might be incorrect or perhaps it's the release date in a different region. But in most sources, it's listed as January 23.

Perhaps the user meant approximately that time, or it's a mistake. But the book is famously associated with early 2018.

Jordan Peterson's bibliography: His major works are "Maps of Meaning" (1999) and "12 Rules for Life" (2018). He might have other writings, but "12 Rules for Life" is the one that became a bestseller in 2018.

Given that, I think the answer is "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos."

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "Based on the information, the famous book by Jordan Peterson released in early 2018 is '12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos.' Note that the exact release date might be January 23, 2018, but it's commonly associated with that period."

But to be precise, I should confirm. Since I'm an AI, I can rely on general knowledge. In this case, it's safe to assume that's the book.

Final answer should be just the book name on a new line.

So, my response: I can briefly explain and then give the answer.

Response structure:

- Acknowledge the query.

- Provide the answer.

- End with the book name on a new line.
