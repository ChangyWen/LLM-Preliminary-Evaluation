*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 12, 1969, created by Michael Crichton. I need to recall or know about Michael Crichton's works.

Michael Crichton is a well-known author, famous for books like Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain, and others. I need to find out which book was released on that specific date.

The date given is 1969-05-12, which is May 12, 1969. I should check if I know any of Crichton's books from that time.

I remember that "The Andromeda Strain" is one of his early works. Let me think about its publication date. I believe "The Andromeda Strain" was published in 1969. Is it exactly on May 12?

I'm not sure about the exact date, but I can reason based on what I know. If the user specifies the date, it's likely that "The Andromeda Strain" is the book they're referring to, as it's one of his most famous and was indeed published in 1969.

Confirming: "The Andromeda Strain" was published in 1969. Now, is the exact date May 12? I might not have that memorized, but in the context of this query, it's probably correct.

Michael Crichton's first novel was "The Andromeda Strain," and it was a bestseller. If it was released in 1969, and the user gives a specific date, I should assume that's the one.

To be thorough, I should consider if there are other books by Crichton from 1969. I think "The Andromeda Strain" was his breakout novel, and he might not have had multiple releases in the same year early in his career.

The user says "famous book," so it's likely "The Andromeda Strain."

Now, the user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "Based on the information, the famous book by Michael Crichton released on May 12, 1969, is The Andromeda Strain."

Then, end with the answer on a new line.

Finally, box the answer as per the instruction, but since this is a text response, I'll just write it clearly.

The instruction is to put the final answer in a new line, so I'll do that.

Confirming the date: Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, "The Andromeda Strain" was published on May 12, 1969. I think that's accurate.

So, my final answer is "The Andromeda Strain".
