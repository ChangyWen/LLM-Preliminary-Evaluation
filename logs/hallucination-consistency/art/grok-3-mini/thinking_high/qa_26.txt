From my knowledge, "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" is his most famous work, and it's a novel that gained a lot of popularity, especially after the film adaptation in 2012. He has written other things, like directing movies, but this book is the one that matches the date.

The user specified "famous book," and "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" is indeed famous. It's a coming-of-age story, often studied in schools, and has a significant cultural impact.

Now, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly. I shouldn't just blurt out the answer; I can provide a bit of context or confirmation, but keep it concise.

Response structure:
