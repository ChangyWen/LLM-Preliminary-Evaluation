*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 12, 1969, created by Michael Crichton. I need to recall if Michael Crichton has a book that matches this date.

Michael Crichton is known for books like "Jurassic Park," "The Andromeda Strain," and "Sphere." I need to check the release date of his books.

From my knowledge:

- "The Andromeda Strain" was published in 1969. Let me confirm the exact date. I believe it was released on May 12, 1969. That sounds right.

Yes, upon double-checking my internal knowledge, "The Andromeda Strain" by Michael Crichton was indeed published on May 12, 1969.

Is it famous? Absolutely, it's one of his breakthrough novels and was adapted into a film.

The user specified "1969-05-12," which is May 12, 1969, so that matches.

Now, the instructions: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I should structure my response with some reasoning or confirmation, and then end with the answer on a new line.

Finally, the answer should be just the name of the book.

Response structure:

- Start with a brief response.

- End with the answer on a new line.
