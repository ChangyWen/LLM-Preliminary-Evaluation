First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1953-04-13, created by Ian Fleming.

I know that Ian Fleming is the author of the James Bond series. The first James Bond book is "Casino Royale."

Let me confirm the release date. I recall that "Casino Royale" was published in 1953. Specifically, it was released on April 13, 1953, in the UK.

Yes, that matches the date given: 1953-04-13.

So, the book is "Casino Royale."

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief explanation and then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer: Casino Royale

Make sure it's on a new line. So, in my response, I'll have some text, and then a blank line followed by the answer.
