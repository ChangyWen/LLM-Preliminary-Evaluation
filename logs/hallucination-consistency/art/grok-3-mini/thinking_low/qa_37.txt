First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Stephen King that was released on June 8, 1987.

I need to recall Stephen King's bibliography. Stephen King is a prolific author, and one of his famous books from that time is "The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger" or others, but let me think specifically about 1987.

I believe Stephen King's book "The Eyes of the Dragon" was published in 1987, but I'm not sure about the exact date. That might not be it.

Another one is "Misery," which I think was published in 1987. Let me confirm that. Yes, "Misery" by Stephen King was first published in 1987.

Now, the user specified the exact date: June 8, 1987. I need to verify if "Misery" was released on that specific date.

From my knowledge, "Misery" was indeed published in June 1987. Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, I recall that the hardcover edition of "Misery" was released on June 8, 1987, by Viking Press.

That matches. So, the book is "Misery."

Is there any other book by Stephen King released on that exact date? I don't think so. Stephen King typically has one major release per year, and "Misery" is his most famous from 1987.

The user asked for the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation and then end with the answer.

Final answer: Misery
