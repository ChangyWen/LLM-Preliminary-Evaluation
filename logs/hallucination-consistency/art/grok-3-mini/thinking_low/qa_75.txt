*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2005-04-12 and created by Steven Levitt.

I need to recall if I know about Steven Levitt. He's an economist, and he's famous for co-authoring a book with Stephen J. Dubner. The book is "Freakonomics."

Let me confirm the details. "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything" was indeed written by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner.

Now, about the release date: Was it released on April 12, 2005? I should verify this from my knowledge. Upon thinking, yes, "Freakonomics" was published in April 2005. Specifically, I believe it was April 12, 2005, in the United States.

Is that exact? Let me double-check my internal knowledge. From what I remember, the book was released on April 12, 2005.

The user specified "created by Steven Levitt." While Levitt is the primary author, it's co-authored, but I think it's acceptable to attribute it to him as the creator.

So, the book is "Freakonomics."

The user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward question, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
