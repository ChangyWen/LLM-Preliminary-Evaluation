*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1999-02-01 and created by Stephen Chbosky.

I need to recall if I know about Stephen Chbosky. He's the author of "The Perks of Being a Wallflower." Let me verify the release date.

From my knowledge, "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" was published in 1999. Is the exact date February 1, 1999? I think it was released on February 1, 1999. That sounds right.

Is this book famous? Yes, it's a well-known young adult novel that was adapted into a film in 2012.

So, the book is "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" by Stephen Chbosky.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward question, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Final answer format: Put it on a new line at the end.

Response structure:
- Maybe a brief confirmation or introduction.
- Then, the final answer on a new line.

For example:
"I believe the famous book you're referring to is 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' by Stephen Chbosky."

Then, on a new line: "The Perks of Being a Wallflower"

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, perhaps the response can be:
[Some text]
Final answer:
[The book name]

Make sure it's accurate. Is there any other book by Stephen Chbosky released on that exact date? I don't think so. He's most famous for this one.

Stephen Chbosky's other works include the screenplay for "Beauty and the Beast" and directing, but for books, "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" is his debut novel.

I'm confident with this.
