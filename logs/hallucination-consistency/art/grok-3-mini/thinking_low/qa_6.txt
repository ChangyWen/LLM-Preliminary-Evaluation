*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on February 28, 2002, created by Richard K. Morgan.

I need to recall if I know any books by Richard K. Morgan. From my knowledge, Richard K. Morgan is a science fiction author. His most famous book is "Altered Carbon," which is part of a series.

Let me verify the release date. I believe "Altered Carbon" was first published in 2002. Is the exact date February 28? I'm not entirely sure about the exact date, but I know it's from 2002.

Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, "Altered Carbon" by Richard K. Morgan was indeed published in 2002. The exact date might be February 28, as the user specified.

The user says "released in 2002-02-28," which is February 28, 2002. I should confirm if that's accurate. In my training data, I recall that "Altered Carbon" was published on February 28, 2002, in the UK.

Yes, that sounds right. It's a cyberpunk science fiction novel that became very popular, especially after the Netflix adaptation.

So, the famous book is "Altered Carbon."

The user asks to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer: Altered Carbon

Make sure it's on a new line. So, something like:

After verifying, the famous book by Richard K. Morgan released on February 28, 2002, is Altered Carbon.

Then, on a new line: Altered Carbon

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, perhaps:

[Some response text]

Final answer:

Altered Carbon

That makes sense.

Is there any other book by Richard K. Morgan that might fit this description? His other works like "Broken Angels" or "Woken Furies" are from later years. "Altered Carbon" is his debut novel from 2002.

Yes, confirmed.
