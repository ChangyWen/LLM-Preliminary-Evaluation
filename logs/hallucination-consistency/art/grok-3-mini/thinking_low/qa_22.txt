*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2001-09-11, created by Yann Martel. I need to recall if I know about Yann Martel and his books.

Yann Martel is a Canadian author, and his most famous book is "Life of Pi." I believe "Life of Pi" was published in 2001. Let me double-check the exact date. The user specified 2001-09-11, which is September 11, 2001.

September 11, 2001, is the date of the 9/11 attacks in the United States. Did "Life of Pi" really release on that exact day? I think it was published in September 2001, but I'm not sure about the precise date.

Upon thinking, I recall that "Life of Pi" was first published in the UK on September 11, 2001, by Canongate Books. Yes, that sounds right. It went on to win the Man Booker Prize in 2002.

So, the book is "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel, released on 2001-09-11.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and accurate. I don't need to add extra information unless it's necessary, but since this is a direct question, I can keep it straightforward.

Final answer: Life of Pi

I need to put it on a new line at the end. So, something like:

After reasoning, I'll say the answer.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, my response could be: [Some text if needed] Then, on a new line, the answer.

To make it clear, I can say: The famous book is Life of Pi.

Then, on a new line: Life of Pi

Perhaps just end with it.

Let me plan:

- Start with a confirmation or brief response.

- End with the answer on a new line.

For example:

The famous book by Yann Martel released on September 11, 2001, is Life of Pi.

[New line]

Life of Pi

That might be redundant. Since they said "give me your final answer in a new line," I can have a sentence or two, then the answer.

To keep it simple:

I believe the book you're referring to is Life of Pi by Yann Martel.

Final answer:

Life of Pi

Yes.

Is there any other book by Yann Martel that might fit? His other works like "Self" or "Beatrice and Virgil" were published later, so no.

Confirmed.
