First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 27, 1959, created by Richard Condon.

I need to recall or know about Richard Condon's works. Richard Condon is an American author known for his political thrillers. One of his most famous books is "The Manchurian Candidate."

Let me verify the release date. I believe "The Manchurian Candidate" was published in 1959. Is the exact date April 27? I'm not entirely sure about the specific date, but the user specified it, so I'll assume that's correct based on their query.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, "The Manchurian Candidate" by Richard Condon was indeed published in 1959. I think the exact date is April 27, 1959, as per the user's question.

The book is famous; it's a classic novel that was later adapted into films.

So, the answer should be "The Manchurian Candidate."

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.

Final response structure:
- A short introductory sentence.
- Then, the answer on a new line.
