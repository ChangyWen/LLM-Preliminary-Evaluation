*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 13, 2007, created by Pablo Fenjves.

I need to recall or know if there's a book by that name and date. I'm an AI, so I have access to general knowledge up to my last training data. Pablo Fenjves is a ghostwriter, and he's known for working on O.J. Simpson's book "If I Did It."

Let me verify that. "If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer" was a book attributed to O.J. Simpson, but it was ghostwritten by Pablo Fenjves. The book was controversial and was released around that time.

The exact release date: I believe "If I Did It" was published in 2007. Let me confirm the date. Upon my knowledge, it was released on November 30, 2006, but that doesn't match. Wait, no. Actually, the book was initially planned for release in 2006 but was pulled, and then it was republished in 2007.

The user specified 2007-09-13, which is September 13, 2007. Is that the correct date for "If I Did It"?

After a quick mental check, I think the book was released on September 13, 2007, by the Goldmans after they acquired the rights. Yes, that sounds right. The original publication was halted, and then the Goldmans published it as "If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer" in 2007.

So, Pablo Fenjves is the ghostwriter for that book.

Therefore, the famous book is "If I Did It."

The user said "created by Pablo Fenjves." Technically, he ghostwrote it, so it's attributed to O.J. Simpson, but Fenjves is the one who wrote it.

I think that's the match.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, my response should end with the book name on a new line.
