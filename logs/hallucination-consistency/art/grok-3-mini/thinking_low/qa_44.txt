*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on November 20, 1990, created by Michael Crichton.

I need to recall Michael Crichton's works. He's the author of books like Jurassic Park, which was adapted into a famous movie.

Was Jurassic Park released in 1990? Let me think: Jurassic Park the novel was published in 1990. I believe it was November 20, 1990. That sounds right.

Confirming: Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park was indeed published on November 20, 1990. It's one of his most famous books.

Is there any other book by Michael Crichton released on that exact date? I don't think so. Jurassic Park is the standout one from that time.

The user specified "famous book," and Jurassic Park fits that description perfectly.

My response needs to end with the final answer on a new line. So, I should structure it like this: provide any necessary reasoning or confirmation, and then on a new line, just the name of the book.

The instruction is: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, for example:

[Some response text]

Final Answer:

Jurassic Park

That makes sense.

Ensure the response is accurate. Double-check the date: Yes, Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton was published on November 20, 1990.

I think that's correct.
