*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2005-04-12 and created by Stephen Dubner. I need to recall if I know about any books by Stephen Dubner.

Stephen Dubner is known for co-authoring "Freakonomics" with Steven Levitt. Let me confirm that. Yes, "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything" was written by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner.

Now, what's the release date of "Freakonomics"? I believe it was published in 2005. Let me double-check that. Upon my knowledge, the first edition of "Freakonomics" was indeed released in April 2005. Specifically, I think it was April 12, 2005, which matches the date given: 2005-04-12.

Is there any other famous book by Stephen Dubner released on that exact date? Dubner is primarily known for the Freakonomics series, and "Freakonomics" is his most famous work. He hasn't authored many books on his own; most are collaborations.

So, it seems like "Freakonomics" is the book in question.

The user says "created by Stephen Dubner." While it's co-authored, it's still attributed to him. I should confirm if there's any solo work, but I don't think so.

Finally, the user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. Start with a brief explanation if needed, then end with the answer on a new line.
