*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1961-10-10, created by Joseph Heller.

I know that Joseph Heller is the author of "Catch-22". Let me confirm the release date. "Catch-22" was indeed published in 1961. I believe the exact date is October 10, 1961, in the United States.

Yes, upon my knowledge, "Catch-22" by Joseph Heller was first published on October 10, 1961.

The user specified "1961-10-10", which is likely meant to be October 10, 1961. That matches.

Is there any other famous book by Joseph Heller released on that exact date? I don't think so. "Catch-22" is his most famous work.

So, the answer should be "Catch-22".

The user asked to "give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." I need to structure my response accordingly. Probably, I should have some explanatory text and then the final answer on a new line.

For example:

[Some response text]

Final Answer:

Catch-22

That makes sense.

Ensure the response is accurate and helpful. I shouldn't add unnecessary information unless it adds value.

Final response structure:

- Start with a confirmation or brief explanation.

- End with the answer on a new line.
