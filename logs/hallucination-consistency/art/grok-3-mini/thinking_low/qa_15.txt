First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 1, 2000, created by Robert Kiyosaki.

I know Robert Kiyosaki is the author of "Rich Dad Poor Dad." Let me confirm the release date of that book.

From my knowledge, "Rich Dad Poor Dad" was first published in 1997, not 2000. That doesn't match.

The user specified 2000-04-01, which is April 1, 2000. Is there another book by Robert Kiyosaki released on that date?

Robert Kiyosaki has written several books in the Rich Dad series. Let me think about the timeline.

"Rich Dad Poor Dad" was indeed published in 1997. Then, there might be sequels or other books.

Perhaps the user means a specific edition or a related book. But the query says "released in 2000-04-01," which is a precise date.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, I recall that "Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant" was published in 2000. Let me verify that.

Yes, "Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant: Guide to Financial Freedom" was released in 2000. Is the exact date April 1? I'm not entirely sure about the exact date, but it's close enough, and it's a famous book by him.

The user specified 2000-04-01, which might be the exact release date. In publishing, books often have specific release dates.

Assuming that's correct, "Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant" is the one.

To be precise, I should confirm if that's accurate. Based on common knowledge, that's likely.

The query says "created by Robert Kiyosaki," and it's famous, released on that date.

My final answer should be the name of the book, and I need to put it in a new line at the end of my response.

So, structure my response: I can say something like, "After considering Robert Kiyosaki's works, the famous book released on April 1, 2000, is 'Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant'."

Then, end with the book name on a new line.

Is that the exact book? Let me make sure. Upon second thought, I think "Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant" was published in 1998 or 2000? Wait, no, I believe it's 2000.

Yes, according to my knowledge, it was published in 2000.

Alright, I'll go with that.
