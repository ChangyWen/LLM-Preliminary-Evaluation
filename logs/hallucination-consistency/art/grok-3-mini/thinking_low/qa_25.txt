First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 5, 1957, created by Jack Kerouac.

I know Jack Kerouac is a famous author, associated with the Beat Generation. His most famous book is "On the Road."

Let me confirm the release date. I recall that "On the Road" was indeed published in 1957. Specifically, I think it was September 5, 1957. That matches the date given in the query.

Is there any other book by Jack Kerouac that was released on that exact date? I don't think so. "On the Road" is his breakout novel and the one most associated with that year.

Just to double-check: Jack Kerouac wrote "On the Road" based on his experiences in the 1940s, and it was published by Viking Press on September 5, 1957.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my answer accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward question, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Final answer: The name of the book is "On the Road."

Response structure:
- I can start with a brief confirmation if I want, but the query doesn't require it.
- End with the answer on a new line.
