*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2015-05-26 and created by Jenny Han. I need to recall or know about Jenny Han's books.

Jenny Han is an author known for young adult novels. One of her famous series is "To All the Boys I've Loved Before." Let me think about the release dates.

The first book in that series, "To All the Boys I've Loved Before," was published in 2014. That doesn't match 2015-05-26.

The sequel is "P.S. I Still Love You." I believe that was released in 2015. Let me confirm the exact date.

Upon my knowledge, "P.S. I Still Love You" by Jenny Han was indeed released on May 26, 2015. That matches the date given: 2015-05-26.

Is this book famous? Yes, it's part of a popular series that was adapted into a Netflix movie, so it's well-known.

The user specified "created by Jenny Han," which fits, and the date matches.

Just to double-check, are there any other books by Jenny Han released on that exact date? I don't think so. Her bibliography includes:

- The Summer I Turned Pretty series

- To All the Boys series

And "P.S. I Still Love You" is from the To All the Boys series.

So, the book is "P.S. I Still Love You."

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation and then end with the answer.

Final answer: P.S. I Still Love You
