*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2005-04-12 and created by Steven Levitt.

I need to recall if I know about Steven Levitt. He's an economist, and he's famous for co-authoring a book with Stephen J. Dubner. The book is "Freakonomics."

Let me confirm the details. "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything" was indeed written by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner.

Now, about the release date: Was it released on April 12, 2005? I should verify this from my knowledge. Upon thinking, yes, "Freakonomics" was published in April 2005. Specifically, I believe it was April 12, 2005, in the United States.

Is that exact date accurate? From what I remember, the hardcover edition was released on April 12, 2005.

The user specified "created by Steven Levitt." While he co-authored it, that's fine; he's one of the creators.

The book is famous, so that matches.

Finally, the user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, my response should be something like: [Some explanation if needed], and then on a new line: Freakonomics.

The instruction is: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

I should structure it properly.

Let me outline:

- Start with a brief response.

- End with the answer on a new line.

For example:

"I believe the famous book you're referring to is Freakonomics, which was released on April 12, 2005, and co-authored by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner.

Final answer:
Freakonomics"

That seems good.

Is there any other book by Steven Levitt released on that exact date? I don't think so. "Freakonomics" is his most famous work.

Alright, I think that's it.
