First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on February 19, 1963, created by Betty Friedan.

I know that Betty Friedan is a famous feminist author. Her most well-known book is "The Feminine Mystique." I need to confirm the release date.

From my knowledge, "The Feminine Mystique" was indeed published in 1963. Let me double-check the exact date. I believe it was published on February 19, 1963. That matches the user's query.

So, the book is "The Feminine Mystique" by Betty Friedan.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer format: Put the book name on a new line at the end.

Response structure:
- Optional: A short introductory sentence.
- Then, the final answer on a new line.

For example:
"I believe the famous book you're referring to is 'The Feminine Mystique' by Betty Friedan."

Then, on a new line: "The Feminine Mystique"

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, perhaps the response can be:
[Some text]
Final answer:
[The book name]

Make sure it's accurate. Is there any other book by Betty Friedan released on that date? I don't think so; "The Feminine Mystique" is her seminal work.

Confirm the date: Yes, historical records confirm it was published on February 19, 1963.

Alright, I'm ready.
