*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 19, 2012, created by Joël Dicker.

I need to recall or know about Joël Dicker's books. Joël Dicker is a Swiss author, and one of his most famous books is "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair."

Let me verify the release date. From my knowledge, "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair" was published in 2012. I think it was indeed released in September 2012.

Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, the original French version, titled "La Vérité sur l'Affaire Harry Quebert," was published on September 19, 2012.

Yes, that matches the date given: 2012-09-19.

So, the book is "La Vérité sur l'Affaire Harry Quebert," but since the user might be referring to the English title, which is "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair."

The user said "created by Joël Dicker," and the date is specific, so I should use the most accurate name. However, in English contexts, it's commonly known as "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair."

The user asked for the name of the famous book, and it's likely they mean the English title if they're communicating in English.

Finally, the user instructed: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I need to structure my response with the answer on a new line at the end.

My response should be: Some introductory text if needed, then the final answer on a new line.

To keep it concise, I can just confirm and then provide the answer.

Response structure:

- Acknowledge the query briefly.

- State the answer on a new line.
