First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1984-11-09 and created by Douglas Adams.

I know Douglas Adams is the author of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" series. Let me recall the books in that series:

1. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1979)

2. The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (1980)

3. Life, the Universe and Everything (1982)

4. So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish (1984)

5. Mostly Harmless (1992)

So, "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish" was published in 1984. I need to confirm the exact date. The user specified 1984-11-09, which is November 9, 1984.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish" was indeed published on November 9, 1984, in the UK.

This matches the description: a famous book by Douglas Adams released on that date.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since it's a straightforward question, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer: The name of the book is "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish".

Make sure to put it on a new line at the end.
