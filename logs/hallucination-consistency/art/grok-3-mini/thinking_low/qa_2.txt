*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 10, 1981, created by Dean Koontz. I need to recall or know if Dean Koontz has a book that matches this date.

Dean Koontz is a well-known author, famous for thrillers and horror novels. Some of his popular books include "The Silent Corner," "Odd Thomas," and "Watchers." But I need to pinpoint one from 1981.

I believe Dean Koontz's book "The Voice of the Night" was published in 1980, not 1981. Let me think carefully.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, I recall that Dean Koontz's book "The Funhouse" was published in 1980, and "Whispers" was published in 1980 as well. Is there one in 1981?

I think "The Key to Midnight" was published in 1979, but that might not be right. Actually, upon reflection, I believe Dean Koontz's book "The Mask" was published in 1981, but I'm not sure about the exact date.

The user specified the exact date: May 10, 1981. I need to verify if that's accurate for any of his books.

From my knowledge, Dean Koontz's book "Whispers" was actually published in 1980. Let me think again.

Perhaps it's "The Eyes of Darkness." I think that was published in 1981. Yes, "The Eyes of Darkness" by Dean Koontz was first published in 1981.

But is the exact date May 10? I'm not entirely sure about the precise date, but for the sake of this exercise, I'll assume that's the one, as it's a famous book by him from that year.

Upon second thought, I recall that "The Eyes of Darkness" was originally published as "The Servants of Twilight" or wait, no. Actually, "The Eyes of Darkness" was published in 1981.

To be precise, let me confirm: Dean Koontz's "The Eyes of Darkness" was indeed released in 1981. And if the user specifies May 10, I'll go with that.

Is there a book exactly on that date? In reality, I might not have the exact publication date memorized, but based on common knowledge, "The Eyes of Darkness" is the most likely candidate.

Another book: "How to Write Best-Selling Fiction" by Dean Koontz was published in 1981, but that's not a famous novel; it's a non-fiction book.

The user said "famous book," and probably means a novel. So, for Dean Koontz, his famous novels from around that time include "Whispers" (1980) and "The Voice of the Night" (1980), but let's clarify.

Upon accurate recollection: Dean Koontz's "The House of Thunder" was published in 1982, I think. No.

Actually, after a quick mental search, I believe "Shattered" was 1973, "Whispers" 1980, and "The Mask" in 1981.

Yes, "The Mask" by Dean Koontz was published in 1981.

But is it exactly on May 10? The user might be referring to that.

Perhaps it's "The Key to Midnight," but that was 1979.

To resolve this, I think the most famous book by Dean Koontz from 1981 is "The Eyes of Darkness."

Let me confirm online in my mind: Upon thinking, "The Eyes of Darkness" was first published in 1981 as "The Vision" or something? No, it was "The Eyes of Darkness" in 1981.

Actually, upon double-checking, Dean Koontz's "The Vision" was published in 1977, and "The Eyes of Darkness" in 1981.

Yes, and it's a famous book, often associated with prophecies about COVID-19, though that's a misconception.

So, I'll go with "The Eyes of Darkness."

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should end with the book name on a new line.
