*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2015-08-04 and created by N. K. Jemisin.

I need to recall or know about N. K. Jemisin's books. N. K. Jemisin is a well-known author, especially for her fantasy and science fiction works. One of her most famous series is the Broken Earth trilogy.

Let me think about the release dates. The first book in the Broken Earth trilogy is "The Fifth Season." I believe it was published in 2015.

Confirming the exact date: August 4, 2015. Yes, that sounds right for "The Fifth Season."

To be precise, I should verify if that's accurate. From my knowledge:

- "The Fifth Season" by N. K. Jemisin was indeed published on August 4, 2015.

It's a famous book; it won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2016, which adds to its fame.

So, the book is "The Fifth Season."

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer format: Put it on a new line at the end.

Response structure:

1. Optional: A short introductory sentence.

2. End with the answer on a new line.

For example:

"I believe the famous book by N. K. Jemisin released on August 4, 2015, is The Fifth Season.

Final answer:
The Fifth Season"

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, something like:

[My response text]

Final answer:
[Book name]

Yes.

Is there any other book by N. K. Jemisin released on that exact date? I don't think so. "The Fifth Season" is the one that matches.

Just to double-check: N. K. Jemisin's other works include "The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms" (2010), "The Kingdom of Gods" (2011), etc., but none in 2015 except "The Fifth Season."

Alright, I'm confident.
