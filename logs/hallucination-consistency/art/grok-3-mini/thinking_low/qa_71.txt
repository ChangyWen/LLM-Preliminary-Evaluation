*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1997-07-22 and created by Philip Pullman.

I need to recall if I know about Philip Pullman's books. Philip Pullman is a British author, famous for his fantasy series, particularly "His Dark Materials."

The "His Dark Materials" trilogy includes:

- The first book is "Northern Lights," which was published in the UK in 1995.

- In the US, it's titled "The Golden Compass."

The user specified the release date as 1997-07-22. Is that the release date for one of his books?

Let me think: The second book in the series is "The Subtle Knife," and I believe that was published in 1997.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, "The Subtle Knife" was indeed published in 1997. Let me confirm the exact date. I think it was July 22, 1997, in the UK.

Yes, that matches: 1997-07-22 is July 22, 1997.

So, the book is "The Subtle Knife" by Philip Pullman.

Is this book famous? Absolutely, it's part of the acclaimed "His Dark Materials" series, which has been adapted into films, TV series, and is widely read.
