First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 8, 1995, created by Michael Crichton.

I need to recall Michael Crichton's works. He's the author of books like Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain, and Disclosure.

Now, specifically, which book was released on September 8, 1995? I think Michael Crichton's book "The Lost World" was a sequel to Jurassic Park. Let me confirm the release date.

From my knowledge, "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" by Michael Crichton was published in 1995. I believe the exact date is September 8, 1995. That sounds right.

To double-check, I know that the movie "Jurassic Park" came out in 1993, and the book "The Lost World" was published shortly after. Yes, it was in 1995.

Is there any other book by Michael Crichton released on that exact date? I don't think so. His other works around that time include "Disclosure" in 1994 and "Airframe" in 1996, so 1995 is likely "The Lost World."

The user specified "famous book," and "The Lost World" is indeed famous, especially as it led to another movie.

So, my final answer should be the name of the book: "The Lost World."

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

Response structure:
- I can have a brief explanation or confirmation.
- Then, end with the answer on a new line.

For example:
"I believe the famous book by Michael Crichton released on September 8, 1995, is The Lost World."

Then, on a new line: "The Lost World"

To make it clear, I'll just state it directly.
