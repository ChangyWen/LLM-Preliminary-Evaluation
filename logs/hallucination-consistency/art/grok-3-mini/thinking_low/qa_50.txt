First, the user asked: "What is the name of the famous book that was released in 2007-09-13 and created by Pablo Fenjves?"

I need to recall if I know anything about a book by Pablo Fenjves released on that date. The date is 2007-09-13, which is September 13, 2007.

Pablo Fenjves is a ghostwriter. I think he's known for working on O.J. Simpson's book. Specifically, I believe he was involved with "If I Did It" by O.J. Simpson.

Let me confirm: "If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer" was a book attributed to O.J. Simpson, but it was ghostwritten by Pablo Fenjves. And I think it was published around that time.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, "If I Did It" was indeed released in 2007. Let me verify the exact date. I believe it was published on November 30, 2006, but that doesn't match. Wait, no.

Actually, upon second thought, the original publication was planned for November 2006, but it was canceled, and then it was released later. Wait, that might not be accurate.

I need to be precise. From what I recall, "If I Did It" was set to be published in November 2006 by Judith Regan, but due to controversy, it was pulled. Then, in 2007, the rights were acquired by the Goldman family, and a new version was published.

Specifically, I think the book was released on September 13, 2007, as "If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer" by the Goldman family.

Yes, that matches the date: 2007-09-13.

So, the book is "If I Did It" by O.J. Simpson, with Pablo Fenjves as the ghostwriter.

The user said "created by Pablo Fenjves," which might imply he's the primary creator, even though it's attributed to Simpson.

Is this book famous? Absolutely, due to the O.J. Simpson trial and the controversy.

So, the famous book is "If I Did It."

To be thorough, let me ensure there isn't another book by Fenjves released on that exact date. From my knowledge, this is his most notable work.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, my response should end with the book name on a new line.
