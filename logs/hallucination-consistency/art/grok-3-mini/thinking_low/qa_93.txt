*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2006-10-02 and created by Richard Dawkins.

I need to recall what book that is. Richard Dawkins is a well-known author, especially for books on evolution and atheism. One of his famous books is "The God Delusion." Let me verify the release date.

From my knowledge, "The God Delusion" was indeed published in 2006. I think the exact date is October 2, 2006. That matches the date given: 2006-10-02.

To confirm, other books by Dawkins include "The Selfish Gene" (1976), "The Blind Watchmaker" (1986), "Climbing Mount Improbable" (1996), and "The Ancestor's Tale" (2004). None of those are from 2006.

After "The God Delusion," he wrote "The Greatest Show on Earth" in 2009, so 2006 is specifically for "The God Delusion."

The user specified the exact date, 2006-10-02, which is October 2, 2006. I believe that's correct for the UK release of "The God Delusion."

The response should end with the final answer on a new line. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "The famous book by Richard Dawkins released on October 2, 2006, is 'The God Delusion'."

Finally, put the answer on a new line at the end.

Final answer format: Just the book name on a new line.
