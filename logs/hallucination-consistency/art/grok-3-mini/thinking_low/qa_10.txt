First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 15, 1977, created by J. R. R. Tolkien.

I know J. R. R. Tolkien is the author of "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Hobbit." I need to recall if there's a book by him released on that specific date.

Tolkien passed away in 1973, so he didn't release any books after that. That means any book released in 1977 would likely be a posthumous publication.

I remember that "The Silmarillion" was published posthumously. Let me confirm the release date. I believe "The Silmarillion" was edited by Christopher Tolkien and published in 1977.

Yes, upon my knowledge, "The Silmarillion" was first published on September 15, 1977.

So, the famous book is "The Silmarillion."

The user specified "created by J. R. R. Tolkien," which is accurate because Tolkien wrote the content, even though it was edited and published after his death.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

My response should be straightforward, and end with the answer on a new line.
