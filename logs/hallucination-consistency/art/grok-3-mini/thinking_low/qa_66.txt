First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book. The details given are: released on 2018-03-06 and created by Tomi Adeyemi.

I need to recall or know about books by Tomi Adeyemi. From my knowledge, Tomi Adeyemi is the author of the book "Children of Blood and Bone." Let me verify the release date.

"Children of Blood and Bone" was indeed released in 2018. I think the exact date is March 6, 2018. That matches the user's query.

So, the book is "Children of Blood and Bone" by Tomi Adeyemi.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.

Yes.

Is there any other book by Tomi Adeyemi that might fit? Her debut novel is "Children of Blood and Bone," and it was published in 2018. Subsequent books like "Children of Virtue and Vengeance" came later, in 2019. So, this matches.

I'm confident with this.
