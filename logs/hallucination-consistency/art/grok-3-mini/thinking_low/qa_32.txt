*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2002-07-02, created by Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman. I know Neil Gaiman as an author, and his full name is Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman, so that matches.

I need to recall if Neil Gaiman released a book on July 2, 2002. Let me think about his bibliography.

Some of Neil Gaiman's famous books include:

- "American Gods" (published in 2001)

- "Coraline" (published in 2002)

Is "Coraline" the one? Let me double-check the release date. I believe "Coraline" was first published in 2002. Upon my knowledge, "Coraline" was released on July 2, 2002, in the UK.

Yes, that sounds right. It's a famous book, especially known for its adaptation into a movie.

So, the book is "Coraline" by Neil Gaiman.

The user specified the date as 2002-07-02, which is July 2, 2002. I should confirm if that's accurate. From my knowledge, yes, that's the release date for "Coraline".

Is there any other book by Neil Gaiman released on that exact date? I don't think so. "American Gods" was earlier, and his next major works came later.

Finally, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

Response structure:

- I can have a brief explanation if needed, but since they asked for the final answer in a new line, I'll keep it concise.

- End with the answer on a new line.
