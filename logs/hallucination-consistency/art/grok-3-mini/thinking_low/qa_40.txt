*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 13, 2016, created by Mark Manson.

I need to recall or know about Mark Manson's books. Mark Manson is a well-known author, and his most famous book is "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck." I believe that's the one.

Let me verify the release date. From my knowledge, "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" was published in September 2016. Specifically, I think it was released on September 13, 2016. That matches the date given.

Is there any other book by Mark Manson that might fit this description? He has other works, like his blog and perhaps other books, but "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" is by far his most famous one, and it was released around that time.

To confirm:

- Book title: The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck

- Author: Mark Manson

- Release date: September 13, 2016

Yes, that seems correct.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly. Maybe provide a bit of context or just directly answer, but end with the answer on a new line.

Response structure:

- I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation.

- Then, end with the answer on a new line.

For example:

"I believe the famous book you're referring to is 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck' by Mark Manson, which was indeed released on September 13, 2016.

Final answer:
The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck"

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, something like:

[Some response text]

Final answer:
[Book name]

Also, ensure the book title is accurate. The full title is "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life," but commonly it's shortened.

I think just the main title is fine.

One more thing: The title has an expletive, "F*ck." I should use it as is, since it's the official title.

Alright, I think I'm ready.
