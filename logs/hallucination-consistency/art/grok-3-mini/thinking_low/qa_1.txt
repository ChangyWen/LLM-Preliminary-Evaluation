*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Stephen King that was released on September 15, 1986.

I need to recall Stephen King's bibliography. Stephen King is a prolific author, and one of his famous books from that time is "It." Let me verify the release date.

From my knowledge, "It" by Stephen King was indeed published in 1986. I believe the exact date is September 15, 1986. That matches the query.

Is there any other book by Stephen King released on that exact date? I don't think so. "It" is one of his most iconic works, so it's likely the one they're referring to.

The user specifies "famous book," and "It" certainly qualifies as it's a bestseller and has been adapted into movies and TV miniseries.

My response should end with the final answer on a new line. So, I need to structure it like this: provide any necessary reasoning or confirmation, and then on a new line, just the name of the book.

The query says: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I should have my answer at the end, on a new line.

For example:

[Some response text]

Final Answer:

It

Make sure it's clear and direct.

Is the date exactly September 15, 1986? Let me double-check my knowledge. Upon reflection, yes, that's the publication date for "It."

If I'm unsure, I should stick to what I know, as this is a simulated response.

Final answer: The book is "It" by Stephen King.
