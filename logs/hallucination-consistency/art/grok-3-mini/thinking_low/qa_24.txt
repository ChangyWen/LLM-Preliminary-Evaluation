*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2020-05-19 and created by Suzanne Collins. I need to recall if I know about any books by Suzanne Collins.

Suzanne Collins is the author of the Hunger Games series. Her most famous works are the Hunger Games trilogy and possibly other books. Is there a book she released in 2020?

I remember that Suzanne Collins released a new book in 2020. It's called "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes." Let me confirm the release date. I believe it was released on May 19, 2020. That matches the date given: 2020-05-19.

So, the book is "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes." It's a prequel to the Hunger Games series and was indeed released on that date.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer: The name of the book is "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes."

Make sure the response is accurate. Is there any other book by Suzanne Collins released on that exact date? I don't think so; this seems to be the one.

Alright, let's outline the response:

- Acknowledge the query.

- State the book name.

- End with the final answer on a new line.
