From my knowledge, "We Need to Talk About Kevin" was published in 2003. Specifically, I think it was released on April 14, 2003, in the UK. That matches the date given: 2003-04-14.

Yes, upon confirmation in my internal knowledge, Lionel Shriver's "We Need to Talk About Kevin" was first published on April 14, 2003.

The book is indeed famous; it won the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2005 and was adapted into a film in 2011.

So, the answer should be "We Need to Talk About Kevin."
