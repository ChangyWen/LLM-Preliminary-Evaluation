*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2014-01-28 and created by Pierce Brown. I need to recall or know about Pierce Brown's books.

Pierce Brown is an author known for his science fiction series. His most famous book is "Red Rising," which is the first book in the Red Rising series.

Let me verify the release date. I believe "Red Rising" was published in 2014. Is the exact date January 28, 2014? From my knowledge, yes, "Red Rising" by Pierce Brown was released on January 28, 2014.

To confirm, I should think if there are any other books by Pierce Brown around that time. His debut novel is "Red Rising," and subsequent books came later. So, this matches.

The user specifies "famous book," and "Red Rising" is indeed famous, with a movie adaptation in the works.

My response needs to end with the final answer on a new line. So, I should structure it like this: provide any necessary reasoning or confirmation, and then put the answer alone on a new line at the end.

Final answer: The name of the book is "Red Rising."

Response structure:
- I can start with a brief confirmation.
- End with the answer on a new line.
