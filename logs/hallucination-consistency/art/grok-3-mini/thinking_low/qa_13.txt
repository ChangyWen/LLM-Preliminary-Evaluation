*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1990-05-10 and created by Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman. I know Neil Gaiman as a famous author, and his full name is Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman, which matches.

I need to recall if Neil Gaiman released a book on May 10, 1990. From my knowledge, one of his famous books is "Good Omens," which he co-wrote with Terry Pratchett. Let me verify the release date.

Upon thinking, "Good Omens" was first published in 1990. I believe the exact date is May 10, 1990. Yes, that sounds right.

Is "Good Omens" the book in question? It's a famous book, and it's by Neil Gaiman (and Terry Pratchett). The user said "created by Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman," which might imply it's solely his, but he co-authored it. However, it's still attributed to him.

Are there other books by Neil Gaiman from 1990? His earlier works include "The Sandman" comics, but that's a series starting in 1989. For books, "Good Omens" is the one that fits.

Confirming the date: Yes, "Good Omens" was published on May 10, 1990, in the UK.

The user asks to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary.

Final answer: The book is "Good Omens."

To be precise, the full title is "Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch."

But commonly, it's just called "Good Omens."

I think stating "Good Omens" is sufficient.
