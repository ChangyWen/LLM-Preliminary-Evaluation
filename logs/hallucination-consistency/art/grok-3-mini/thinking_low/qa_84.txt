*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on December 2, 1950, created by Isaac Asimov.

I need to recall Isaac Asimov's works. He's a famous science fiction author, known for the Foundation series, I, Robot, and others.

Specifically, was there a book released on December 2, 1950? Let me think about his bibliography.

I remember that "I, Robot" was published in 1950. But was it exactly on December 2?

Upon double-checking my knowledge, "I, Robot" is a collection of short stories, and it was first published in 1950. But I need to confirm the exact date.

The user specified "1950-12-02", which is December 2, 1950. Is that the exact release date for "I, Robot"?

From what I know, "I, Robot" was published by Gnome Press in December 1950. I believe the exact date is indeed December 2, 1950.

Yes, that's correct. Isaac Asimov's "I, Robot" was released on December 2, 1950.

It's a famous book, so that fits.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should end with the book name on a new line.

Structure my response: I can start with a brief explanation or confirmation, then end with the answer.

For example: "The famous book by Isaac Asimov released on December 2, 1950, is I, Robot."

Then, on a new line: "I, Robot"

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, perhaps: [Some response text]

Final answer:

I, Robot

That makes sense.

Is there any other book by Asimov released on that exact date? I don't think so. "I, Robot" is the one.

Just to be thorough, Asimov wrote many short stories and novels, but this date is specifically tied to "I, Robot."

Alright, I think that's it.
