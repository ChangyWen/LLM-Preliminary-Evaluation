*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on June 1, 1961, created by Robert A. Heinlein.

I need to recall or know about Robert A. Heinlein's works. He's a famous science fiction author. Some of his well-known books include "Starship Troopers," "Stranger in a Strange Land," and "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress."

Now, specifically, which one was released on June 1, 1961? I think "Stranger in a Strange Land" was published in 1961. Let me double-check that.

From my knowledge, "Stranger in a Strange Land" by Robert A. Heinlein was indeed published in 1961. I believe the exact date is June 1, 1961. That matches the query.

Is that accurate? Let me make sure. Upon thinking, yes, it's commonly cited as being published on June 1, 1961.

Other books by Heinlein: "Starship Troopers" was 1959, "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" was 1966, so 1961 points to "Stranger in a Strange Land."

The user specified "famous book," and "Stranger in a Strange Land" is one of his most famous, influencing counterculture and popular culture.

So, the answer should be "Stranger in a Strange Land."

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.

For example:

"I believe the famous book by Robert A. Heinlein released on June 1, 1961, is Stranger in a Strange Land.

Final answer:
Stranger in a Strange Land"

That fits the instruction.
