*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2017-05-23 and created by Kevin Kwan. I need to recall or know about Kevin Kwan's books.

Kevin Kwan is the author of the "Crazy Rich Asians" series. The first book in that series is "Crazy Rich Asians," which was published in 2013. That doesn't match the date 2017-05-23.

Let me think about his other books. The sequel to "Crazy Rich Asians" is "China Rich Girlfriend," and I believe that was released in 2015. Still not 2017.

The next one is "Rich People Problems," which I think was released in 2017. Let me confirm the exact date. From my knowledge, "Rich People Problems" was published on May 23, 2017. That matches the date given: 2017-05-23.

So, the book is "Rich People Problems" by Kevin Kwan.

The user specified "famous book," and the "Crazy Rich Asians" trilogy is quite famous, especially since the first book was adapted into a successful movie.

I need to ensure this is accurate. Upon double-checking my internal knowledge:

- Crazy Rich Asians: June 2013

- China Rich Girlfriend: June 2015

- Rich People Problems: May 23, 2017

Yes, that's correct.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation and then end with the answer.

Final answer: Rich People Problems

Make sure to put it on a new line at the end.
