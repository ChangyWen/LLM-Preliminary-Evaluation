First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Agatha Christie that was released on November 6, 1961. I need to recall if I know about Agatha Christie's books and their release dates.

Agatha Christie is a famous author known for her mystery novels, like Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple series. Some of her well-known books include "Murder on the Orient Express," "And Then There Were None," and "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd."

Now, specifically for 1961-11-06, which is November 6, 1961. I need to think if I know which book was released on that exact date.

From my knowledge, Agatha Christie's book "Pale Horse" or wait, is that right? Actually, I think it's "The Pale Horse." Let me double-check my internal knowledge.

Upon thinking, I recall that "The Pale Horse" by Agatha Christie was indeed published in 1961. But is the exact date November 6?

The user specified 1961-11-06, which might be the exact release date. In reality, book release dates can vary by region, but for the purpose of this query, I should assume that's the date.

To confirm: Agatha Christie's "The Pale Horse" is a novel featuring Ariadne Oliver and involves a mystery with a list of names and supposed murders. It was published in 1961.

So, the famous book is "The Pale Horse."
