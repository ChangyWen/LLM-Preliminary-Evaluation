*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 1992-10-21 and created by Madonna. I need to recall if Madonna has written any books.

Madonna is primarily known as a singer, songwriter, and actress, but she has also ventured into other areas. I remember she released a book called "Sex" in 1992.

Let me verify the details. The book "Sex" by Madonna was indeed published in 1992. I need to check the exact date. From my knowledge, it was released on October 21, 1992. That matches the date given: 1992-10-21.

Is "Sex" a famous book? Yes, it was highly controversial and became a bestseller, known for its explicit content and photographs.

The user specified "created by Madonna," which fits since she conceptualized and starred in the book.

Now, the instructions say: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I need to structure my response accordingly. I should provide a brief response and then end with the answer on a new line.

My response should be helpful and accurate. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a direct question, I can keep it straightforward.

Final answer: The name of the book is "Sex".

To confirm:

- Book: Sex

- Author/Creator: Madonna

- Release date: October 21, 1992

That seems correct.

Response structure:

- Start with a confirming statement if needed.

- End with the answer on a new line.
