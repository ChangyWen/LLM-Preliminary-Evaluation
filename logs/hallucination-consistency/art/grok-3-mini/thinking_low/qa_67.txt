*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2016-01-12 and created by Paul Kalanithi. I need to recall or know about this book.

Paul Kalanithi was a neurosurgeon and writer. I remember he wrote a memoir about his life, illness, and reflections on medicine and mortality. The book is "When Breath Becomes Air."

Let me verify the release date. From my knowledge, "When Breath Becomes Air" was published posthumously after Paul Kalanithi passed away from lung cancer. I believe it was released in January 2016. Specifically, I think it was January 12, 2016.

Yes, that matches the date given: 2016-01-12.

So, the book is "When Breath Becomes Air."

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or context, but keep it concise.

Final answer format: Put the book name on a new line at the end.

Response structure:
- Optional: A short introductory sentence.
- Then, the final answer on a new line.

For example:
"I believe the famous book you're referring to is 'When Breath Becomes Air' by Paul Kalanithi."

And then on a new line: "When Breath Becomes Air"

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, perhaps:
[Some response text]
Final answer:
When Breath Becomes Air

That makes sense.

Is there any other book by Paul Kalanithi? I don't think so; this is his only published book.

Confirming the date: Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, it was released on January 12, 2016.

Alright, I'm good.
