*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on June 8, 1999, created by Thomas Harris.

I need to recall who Thomas Harris is. He's the author of the Hannibal Lecter series, including books like "The Silence of the Lambs" and "Hannibal."

Now, let's think about the release date: June 8, 1999. I believe Thomas Harris released "Hannibal" in 1999. Let me confirm that. Yes, "Hannibal" was published in 1999.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, "Hannibal" by Thomas Harris was indeed published in 1999. I think the exact date is June 8, 1999. That matches.

Is there any other book by Thomas Harris released on that date? His other famous works are "Red Dragon" (1981), "The Silence of the Lambs" (1988), "Hannibal" (1999), and later ones like "Hannibal Rising" (2006). So, no, "Hannibal" is the one from 1999.

The user specified "famous book," and "Hannibal" is indeed famous, as it continued the story of Hannibal Lecter and was adapted into a film.

Finally, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

Response structure:
- I can have a brief explanation if needed, but since the instruction is to reason step by step (for my own process), in the actual response, I should be concise.
- End with the answer on a new line.

Actual response: Keep it straightforward. Start with a confirmation or direct answer, then put the final answer on a new line.
