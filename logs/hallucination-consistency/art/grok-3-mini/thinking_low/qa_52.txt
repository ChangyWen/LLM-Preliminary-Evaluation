First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 19, 1988, created by Thomas Harris.

I need to recall what books Thomas Harris wrote. Thomas Harris is known for his novels about Hannibal Lecter. His famous books include "Red Dragon," "The Silence of the Lambs," "Hannibal," and "Hannibal Rising."

Now, which one was released in 1988? Let me think about the publication dates:

- "Red Dragon" was published in 1981.

- "The Silence of the Lambs" was published in 1988.

Yes, "The Silence of the Lambs" was released on May 19, 1988. That matches the date given.

I should confirm if that's accurate. From my knowledge, yes, "The Silence of the Lambs" by Thomas Harris was indeed published in 1988, and the exact date is May 19, 1988.

The user specified "famous book," and "The Silence of the Lambs" is extremely famous. It was adapted into a highly successful film that won multiple Academy Awards.

So, the answer should be "The Silence of the Lambs."

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief explanation and then end with the answer on a new line.

Final response structure:
