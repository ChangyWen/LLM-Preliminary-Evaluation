*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 5, 1996, created by Frank McCourt.

I need to recall if I know about Frank McCourt and his books. Frank McCourt is an Irish-American author, and his most famous book is "Angela's Ashes." Let me verify the details.

"Angela's Ashes" is a memoir about his childhood in Ireland. I believe it was published in 1996. Is the exact date September 5? I'm not entirely sure, but I think that's correct based on common knowledge.

Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, yes, "Angela's Ashes" by Frank McCourt was published on September 5, 1996.

The user specifies "released in 1996-09-05," which is likely the date format for September 5, 1996. And it's famous, which matches "Angela's Ashes" as it won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography in 1997.

So, the book is "Angela's Ashes."

The user asks to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer format: Put it on a new line at the end.

Response structure:
- Optional: A short introductory sentence.
- Then, the answer on a new line.

For example:
"I believe the famous book you're referring to is Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt."

Then, on a new line: "Angela's Ashes"

To make it clear, I'll say something like:

"The famous book released on September 5, 1996, by Frank McCourt is Angela's Ashes.

Final answer:
Angela's Ashes"

That might work.

Ensure accuracy: Is there any other book by Frank McCourt released on that date? I don't think so; "Angela's Ashes" is his debut and most famous work.
