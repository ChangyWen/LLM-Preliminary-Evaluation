*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2007-10-18 and created by Jay Asher. I need to recall or know about books by Jay Asher.

From my knowledge, Jay Asher is the author of "Thirteen Reasons Why." Let me confirm the release date. I believe "Thirteen Reasons Why" was published in 2007. Is the exact date October 18, 2007?

Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, yes, "Thirteen Reasons Why" by Jay Asher was released on October 18, 2007. It's a famous young adult novel that deals with themes of suicide and bullying, and it was later adapted into a Netflix series.

So, the book is "Thirteen Reasons Why."

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. That means I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer format: Put it on a new line at the end.

Response structure:
- Optional: A short introductory sentence.
- Then, the final answer on a new line.

For example:
"I believe the famous book you're referring to is Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher, which was indeed released on October 18, 2007."

Then, on a new line: "Thirteen Reasons Why"

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, perhaps the response can be:
[Some text]
Final answer:
[Book name]

Make sure it's accurate. Is there any other book by Jay Asher released on that exact date? I don't think so; "Thirteen Reasons Why" is his most famous work.

Alright, let's draft it.
