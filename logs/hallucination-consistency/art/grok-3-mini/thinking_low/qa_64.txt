First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on October 17, 1990, created by William Steig.

I need to recall who William Steig is. He's an author and illustrator, known for children's books. One of his most famous works is "Shrek!", which was published in 1990.

Let me verify the date. I believe "Shrek!" by William Steig was indeed published in 1990. I should confirm if the exact date is October 17, 1990. From my knowledge, that's the release date for "Shrek!".

Other books by William Steig include "Sylvester and the Magic Pebble" (1969) and "Doctor De Soto" (1982), but those aren't from 1990.

So, "Shrek!" matches the criteria: created by William Steig and released in 1990.

The user specified "released in 1990-10-17", which I interpret as October 17, 1990. I need to ensure that's accurate. Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, yes, "Shrek!" was published on October 17, 1990.

The user asks to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation and then state the answer.

Final answer: The name of the book is "Shrek!".

Make sure to put it on a new line at the end.
