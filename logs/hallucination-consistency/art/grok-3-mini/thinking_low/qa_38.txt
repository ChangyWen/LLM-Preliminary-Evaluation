*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2007-05-22 and created by Khaled Hosseini. I need to recall or know about Khaled Hosseini's books.

Khaled Hosseini is the author of "The Kite Runner," which was published in 2003. That's not 2007.

His next book is "A Thousand Splendid Suns." I believe that was published in 2007. Let me confirm the exact date. I think it was released on May 22, 2007. That matches the date given: 2007-05-22.

Yes, according to my knowledge, "A Thousand Splendid Suns" by Khaled Hosseini was indeed published on May 22, 2007.

Is there any other book by him around that time? His third book, "And the Mountains Echoed," was published in 2013, so no.

So, the famous book is "A Thousand Splendid Suns."

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation and then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer: A Thousand Splendid Suns
