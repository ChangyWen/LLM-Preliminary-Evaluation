First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Stephen King that was released on April 5, 1974. I need to recall if Stephen King has a book that matches this date.

Stephen King is a famous author, and one of his early works is "Carrie." I believe "Carrie" was his first published novel. Let me confirm the release date in my knowledge base.

From what I know, "Carrie" was published in 1974. Specifically, I think it was released on April 5, 1974. That sounds right.

Is there any other book by Stephen King from that exact date? Stephen King's bibliography starts with "Carrie" in 1974, and his next ones came later. So, it's likely "Carrie."

The user specified "1974-04-05," which is April 5, 1974. I should double-check if that's accurate. Upon reflection, yes, "Carrie" was indeed published on April 5, 1974.

The user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward question, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

Response structure:
- Start with a brief confirmation or statement.
- End with the answer on a new line.
