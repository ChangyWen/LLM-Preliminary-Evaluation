*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on June 17, 2003, created by Michael Lewis.

I need to recall if I know any books by Michael Lewis. Michael Lewis is a well-known author, famous for books like "Moneyball," "The Big Short," and "Liar's Poker."

Let me think about the release dates. I believe "Moneyball" was published in 2003. Is the exact date June 17, 2003?

From my knowledge, "Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game" by Michael Lewis was indeed published in 2003. I need to confirm the exact date. Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, I recall that "Moneyball" was released on June 17, 2003. That matches the date given.

Is there any other book by Michael Lewis released on that exact date? I don't think so. His other books like "The Big Short" came out in 2010, and "Liar's Poker" in 1989.

So, the book is "Moneyball."

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation and then end with the answer.

Final answer: Moneyball
