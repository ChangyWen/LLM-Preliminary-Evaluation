First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on January 17, 1966, created by Truman Capote.

I need to recall what I know about Truman Capote. He's a famous American author known for works like "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and "In Cold Blood."

Now, which book was released in 1966? I believe "In Cold Blood" was published in 1966. Let me double-check the exact date. I think it was serialized in The New Yorker in 1965 and then published as a book in 1966.

The user specified January 17, 1966. Is that the exact release date for "In Cold Blood"? Upon thinking, I recall that "In Cold Blood" was first published on January 17, 1966, in the United States. Yes, that sounds right.

To confirm: Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood" is indeed a famous book, often credited as the first non-fiction novel, and it was released on that date.

Other works by Capote: "Breakfast at Tiffany's" was published in 1958, so that's not it. His other books don't match this date.

So, the book is "In Cold Blood."

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief explanation and then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer: In Cold Blood
