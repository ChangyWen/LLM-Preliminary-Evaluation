*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2000-10-10, created by Philip Pullman.

I need to recall if Philip Pullman has a book that matches this date. Philip Pullman is known for his "His Dark Materials" trilogy. The books in that series are:

- "The Golden Compass" (or "Northern Lights" in the UK), published in 1995.

- "The Subtle Knife" in 1997.

- "The Amber Spyglass" in 2000.

"The Amber Spyglass" was published in 2000. But is the exact date October 10, 2000?

I believe "The Amber Spyglass" was released on October 10, 2000, in the UK. That sounds right.

Confirming: Yes, upon my knowledge, Philip Pullman's "The Amber Spyglass" was indeed published on October 10, 2000.

It's a famous book, as it's the concluding volume of the His Dark Materials trilogy, which has won awards and been adapted into films and TV series.

So, the book is "The Amber Spyglass".

The user specified "2000-10-10", which is October 10, 2000. That matches.

Now, the user asks to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

My response should be structured accordingly. I can have some reasoning or confirmation in the main body, but end with the answer on a new line.

Finally, phrase it as: "The name of the famous book is [book title]."

Response structure:

- I can start with a brief confirmation.

- End with the answer on a new line.
