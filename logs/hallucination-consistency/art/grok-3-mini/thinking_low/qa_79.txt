*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2005-04-12 and created by Stephen Dubner. I need to recall if I know about any books by Stephen Dubner.

Stephen Dubner is a journalist and author, best known for co-authoring "Freakanomics" with Steven Levitt. Let me confirm that.

Yes, "Freakanomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything" was written by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner. Now, what was the release date of that book?

From my knowledge, "Freakanomics" was first published in April 2005. Let me verify the exact date. I believe it was released on April 12, 2005. That matches the date given: 2005-04-12.

So, the book is "Freakanomics."

The user said "created by Stephen Dubner." Is that accurate? Stephen Dubner co-authored it with Steven Levitt, so he is one of the creators.

Is there any other book by Stephen Dubner released on that exact date? I don't think so. "Freakanomics" is his most famous work.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief explanation and then give the answer.

Final answer: Freakonomics

I should ensure the spelling is correct. It's "Freakonomics," not "Freakanomics." Wait, no, it's "Freakonomics." Let me double-check: Yes, it's "Freakonomics."

Alright, so my response will be:

I'll say something like: "The famous book released on April 12, 2005, and co-authored by Stephen J. Dubner is 'Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything.'"

Then, on a new line: Freakonomics

To be precise, the user said "created by Stephen Dubner," and it's co-authored, but I think that's fine.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
