*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 19, 2012, created by Joël Dicker.

I need to recall or know about Joël Dicker's books. Joël Dicker is a Swiss author, and one of his most famous books is "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair."

Let me verify the release date. From my knowledge, "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair" was published in 2012. I think it was indeed released in September 2012.

Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, the book was first published in French as "La Vérité sur l'Affaire Harry Quebert" in 2012. The exact date might be September 19, 2012, as the user specified.

The user said "released in 2012-09-19," which is likely September 19, 2012. That matches the release date for Dicker's book.

Is this the famous one? Yes, it's his breakout novel and became an international bestseller.

So, the book is "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair."

The user asked for the name in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my answer accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation and then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer: The name of the book is "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair."

I should ensure the title is accurate. In English, it's commonly known as "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair," but originally in French.

Since the user is asking in English, I'll use the English title.

Response structure:

- Acknowledge the query.

- Provide the answer on a new line as specified.
