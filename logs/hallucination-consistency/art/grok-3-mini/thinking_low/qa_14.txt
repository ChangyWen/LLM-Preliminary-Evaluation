*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2017-05-02 and created by Jenny Han. I need to recall or know about Jenny Han's books.

Jenny Han is an author known for young adult novels. Some of her famous works include the "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" series. Let me think about the release dates.

The book "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" was released in 2014. That's not 2017.

The sequel is "P.S. I Still Love You," which was released in 2015.

Then, the third book in the series is "Always and Forever, Lara Jean." I believe that was released in 2017.

Let me confirm the exact date. I think "Always and Forever, Lara Jean" was published on May 2, 2017. That matches the date given: 2017-05-02.

So, the book is "Always and Forever, Lara Jean" by Jenny Han.

Is this book famous? Yes, it's part of a popular series that was adapted into a Netflix movie, so it's well-known.

The user specified "created by Jenny Han," which matches, and the release date is exact.

My response should end with the final answer on a new line.

Structure my response: I can briefly confirm or just state it, but since the instruction is to give the final answer in a new line at the end, I'll keep it straightforward.

Final answer: Always and Forever, Lara Jean

Make sure the format is correct. The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, something like: "After considering the details, the book is [title]."

Then, on a new line: [Title]

To be precise, I'll end with the title on a new line.
