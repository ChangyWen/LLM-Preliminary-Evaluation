*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked: "What is the name of the famous book that was released in 2013-10-10 and created by Tom Bissell?"

I need to recall or know if there's a book by Tom Bissell released on that date. The date is given as 2013-10-10, which I believe is October 10, 2013.

Tom Bissell is a writer, known for books like "Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter" and "The Father of All Things." But is there a specific book released on that exact date?

I'm not immediately sure about the exact release date. I should think about his bibliography. One of his notable works is "The Father of All Things: A Marine, His Son, and the Legacy of Vietnam," but I don't think that's from 2013.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, Tom Bissell co-wrote "The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made" with Greg Sestero. That book was published in 2013.

Let me confirm the release date. I believe "The Disaster Artist" was released on October 1, 2013, not October 10. Is that accurate?

The user specified 2013-10-10, which is October 10, 2013. Is there a book by Tom Bissell on that exact date?

Perhaps it's "Extra Lives," but that was published in 2010.

Maybe it's not "The Disaster Artist." Let me think again. Tom Bissell did co-author "The Disaster Artist," and it was indeed published in 2013. Upon quick mental recall, the publication date for "The Disaster Artist" is October 1, 2013, in the US.

But the user said 2013-10-10, which is close but not exact. Maybe it's a typo or approximation.

Perhaps there's another book. Another one is "Magic Hours," which is a collection of essays, published in 2018, I think. No, that's later.

Tom Bissell's "The Father of All Things" was in 2007.

This is tricky. Maybe the user means "The Disaster Artist" and the date is approximate.

Perhaps I should assume that "The Disaster Artist" is the famous book they're referring to, as it's one of his most well-known works.

To be precise, I need to verify if there's a book released on exactly October 10, 2013.

Upon further reflection, I don't recall any specific book by Tom Bissell on that exact date. However, since the user specified it, and "The Disaster Artist" is from October 2013, it might be that.

Maybe it's not a book, but the user said "book."

Another thought: Tom Bissell has written for various publications, but for books, "The Disaster Artist" is the one.

Perhaps it's "Chasing the Sea," from 2003.

I think I have to go with "The Disaster Artist" as the most likely answer.

The user asked for the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, my response should end with the book name on a new line.

Final answer: The Disaster Artist
