*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2005-04-12 and created by Stephen Dubner. I need to recall or know about books by Stephen Dubner.

Stephen Dubner is known for co-authoring "Freakonomics" with Steven Levitt. Let me confirm that. Yes, "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything" was written by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner.

Now, what's the release date? I believe "Freakonomics" was published in 2005. Let me double-check the exact date. The user specified 2005-04-12, which is April 12, 2005. Is that accurate for "Freakonomics"?

Upon my knowledge, "Freakonomics" was indeed published in April 2005. I think the exact date is April 12, 2005. That matches.

Is there any other famous book by Stephen Dubner released on that date? Dubner is primarily known for "Freakonomics" and its sequels, but the first one is the most famous. He hasn't authored many books solo; "Freakonomics" is his big hit.

So, the book should be "Freakonomics."

The user said "created by Stephen Dubner." Technically, it's co-authored, but it's attributed to both. I think it's fine.

Finally, the user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

Response structure:
- I can have a brief explanation if needed, but since they asked for the final answer in a new line, I'll keep it concise.
- End with the answer on a new line.

Final answer: Freakonomics
