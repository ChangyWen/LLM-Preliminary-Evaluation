First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2003-05-29 and created by Khaled Hosseini. I need to recall or know about Khaled Hosseini's books.

Khaled Hosseini is an author known for his novels. His most famous book is "The Kite Runner." Let me verify the release date.

From my knowledge, "The Kite Runner" was published in 2003. Specifically, I believe it was released on May 29, 2003. That matches the date given: 2003-05-29.

Other books by Hosseini include "A Thousand Splendid Suns" (2007) and "And the Mountains Echoed" (2013), but those don't match the date.

So, the book in question is "The Kite Runner."

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.
