First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 21, 1962, created by Shirley Jackson.

I need to recall what I know about Shirley Jackson. She's a famous author known for her works in horror and psychological fiction. One of her most famous books is "The Lottery," but that's a short story, not a book, and it was published in 1948.

She wrote novels too. Her most famous novel is "The Haunting of Hill House," which was published in 1959. That doesn't match the date.

The user specified 1962-09-21, which is September 21, 1962. Is there a book by Shirley Jackson from that date?

Shirley Jackson died in 1965, so she was active around that time. Let me think about her bibliography.

I believe Shirley Jackson's book "We Have Always Lived in the Castle" was published in 1962. Let me confirm the exact date. Upon my knowledge, it was indeed published in 1962, and I think the exact date is September 21, 1962.

Yes, that sounds right. "We Have Always Lived in the Castle" is one of her most acclaimed works and is considered a classic in Gothic fiction.

So, the famous book is "We Have Always Lived in the Castle."
