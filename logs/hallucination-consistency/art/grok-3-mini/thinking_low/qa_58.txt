*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2010-08-06, created by Emma Donoghue. I need to recall or know about Emma Donoghue's works.

Emma Donoghue is an Irish-Canadian author. One of her most famous books is "Room." I believe "Room" was published in 2010. Let me confirm the exact date.

From my knowledge, "Room" by Emma Donoghue was indeed published in 2010. The specific date mentioned is 2010-08-06, which is August 6, 2010. I think that's the release date for "Room" in some regions, possibly the UK or internationally.

Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, "Room" was released on August 6, 2010, in the UK, and it was a bestseller. It was also shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and adapted into a film.

So, the book is "Room."

The user asks to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer format: Put the book name on a new line at the end.

Response structure:
- Optional: A short introductory sentence.
- Then, the final answer on a new line.

For example:
"I believe the famous book by Emma Donoghue released on August 6, 2010, is Room.

Room"

To make it clear, I'll say something like:

"The famous book by Emma Donoghue released on August 6, 2010, is Room."

And then on a new line: "Room"

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, perhaps:

[Some response text]

Final answer:
Room

That makes sense.

Is there any other book by Emma Donoghue released on that exact date? I don't think so. "Room" is her most prominent work from that time.

I'm confident with this.
