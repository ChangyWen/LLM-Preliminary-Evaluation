*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2013-10-10 and created by Greg Sestero.

I need to recall if I know about Greg Sestero. He's associated with the movie "The Room," which is famously bad. Greg Sestero wrote a book about his experiences with Tommy Wiseau, the director of "The Room."

The book is called "The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made." I believe that's the one.

Now, confirm the release date. Was it released on October 10, 2013? From my knowledge, yes, "The Disaster Artist" by Greg Sestero was published on October 1, 2013. The user said 2013-10-10, which is October 10, 2013. Is that exact?

Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, I think the exact date might be October 1, 2013, for the US release. But the user specified 2013-10-10, which is close. Maybe it's a slight discrepancy, or perhaps in some regions it was October 10.

I should verify if this is the correct book. Is there any other famous book by Greg Sestero released around that time? I don't think so; "The Disaster Artist" is his most famous work.

The user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, my response should be straightforward: explain briefly if needed, and then end with the answer on a new line.

Structure my response:

1. Acknowledge the query.

2. Provide the answer.

3. End with the book name on a new line.

Final answer: The book is "The Disaster Artist" by Greg Sestero.

To be precise, let's confirm the date. Upon quick mental search, I recall it's October 1, 2013, but perhaps the user meant that date. Since this is based on my knowledge, I'll go with it.

If I'm not 100% sure, I should still provide the most likely answer.

Okay, proceeding.
