First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Agatha Christie that was released on November 3, 1958. I need to recall if I know about Agatha Christie's books and their release dates.

Agatha Christie is a famous author known for her mystery novels, like Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple series. One of her well-known books is "Cat Among the Pigeons." I think that was published in 1959, but let me double-check my knowledge.

The date given is 1958-11-03, which is November 3, 1958. I need to confirm if that's the exact release date for any of her books.

From my knowledge, Agatha Christie's book "Ordeal by Innocence" was published in 1958. Let me verify that. Upon thinking, "Ordeal by Innocence" was indeed published in November 1958 in the UK.

I believe the exact date is November 3, 1958, for the UK edition. That matches.

Is "Ordeal by Innocence" a famous book? Yes, it's one of her notable works, involving a murder mystery with a twist.

Other books by her around that time: "4.50 from Paddington" was 1957, and "Cat Among the Pigeons" was 1959. So, 1958 should be "Ordeal by Innocence."

The user specified "released in 1958-11-03," which is a specific date, so I need to ensure that's accurate. Assuming my knowledge is correct, that's the book.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation and then state the answer.

Final answer: The name of the book is "Ordeal by Innocence."
