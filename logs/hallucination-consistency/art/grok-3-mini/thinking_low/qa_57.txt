*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Stephen King that was released on September 8, 1981.

I need to recall Stephen King's bibliography. One of his most famous books is "Cujo," but let me double-check the release date.

Stephen King's books include "The Shining," "Carrie," "It," and "Cujo." I think "Cujo" was indeed released in 1981.

Let me confirm the exact date. From my knowledge, "Cujo" was published in September 1981. Is it specifically September 8?

The user specified 1981-09-08, which is September 8, 1981. I need to verify if that's accurate.

Upon thinking, I believe "Cujo" was released on September 8, 1981. That sounds right.

Other books by Stephen King around that time: "Firestarter" was in 1980, "Danse Macabre" in 1981, but that's non-fiction. "Cujo" is the one that matches.

"Danse Macabre" is a non-fiction book about horror, and it was published in 1981, but I'm not sure about the exact date.

The user said "famous book," and "Cujo" is definitely famous.

To be precise, let me ensure: Yes, "Cujo" by Stephen King was published on September 8, 1981.

So, the answer should be "Cujo."

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "The famous book by Stephen King released on September 8, 1981, is Cujo."

Then, end with the final answer on a new line.

Final answer: Cujo

Make sure it's exactly as specified: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, perhaps my response can be: "After checking, the book you're referring to is Cujo by Stephen King, which was released on September 8, 1981."

Then, on a new line: Cujo

Yes.
