*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Stephen King that was released on September 24, 2013.

I need to recall Stephen King's books. He's a prolific author, and one of his famous books from that time is "Doctor Sleep." Let me verify the release date.

From my knowledge, "Doctor Sleep" is the sequel to "The Shining," and it was indeed published in 2013. I believe the exact date is September 24, 2013.

Yes, upon double-checking my internal knowledge, "Doctor Sleep" by Stephen King was released on September 24, 2013.

Is this book famous? Absolutely, it's a bestseller and was later adapted into a movie.

The user specified "the famous book," implying there might be one primary one, but Stephen King could have released other books around that time. However, based on the date, "Doctor Sleep" matches perfectly.

Now, the instructions say: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I need to structure my response accordingly. I should provide a brief response and then end with the answer on a new line.

For example:

"I believe the famous book by Stephen King released on September 24, 2013, is Doctor Sleep.

Final answer:
Doctor Sleep"

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, perhaps something like:

After thinking about it, the book is Doctor Sleep.

Final answer:
Doctor Sleep

I should ensure the response is accurate and not verbose.

Finally, confirm the details:

- Author: Stephen King

- Release date: September 24, 2013

- Book: Doctor Sleep

Yes, that's correct.
