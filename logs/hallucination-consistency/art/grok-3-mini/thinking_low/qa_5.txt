First, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Stephen King that was released on October 3, 1978. I need to recall if Stephen King has a book that matches this date.

Stephen King is a prolific author, and one of his most famous books is "The Stand." Let me double-check the release date. I believe "The Stand" was first published in 1978, but is the exact date October 3?

Upon thinking, I recall that "The Stand" was published in 1978, but I need to confirm the exact date. From my knowledge, the original publication date for "The Stand" is indeed October 3, 1978. That sounds right.

Is there any other book by Stephen King released on that exact date? Stephen King's other famous works around that time include "Carrie" (1974), "Salem's Lot" (1975), "The Shining" (1977), and then "The Stand" in 1978. So, "The Stand" is the one that fits.

The user specified "1978-10-03," which is October 3, 1978. Yes, that's the release date for "The Stand."

The user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward question, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Final answer: The name of the book is "The Stand."

I should make sure about the exact date. Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, yes, "The Stand" was released on October 3, 1978.

So, my response will be: I'll say something brief, then end with the answer on a new line.
