Okay, here's what's going through my head: Someone wants the name of a book, and they've given me the author and release date. Easy enough. Let's break this down. First, the core request: find a book. I know my game; I need to leverage my knowledge of popular fiction, particularly authors like Kevin Kwan, and match the release date with his known publications.

Right, let's get to work. Kwan. That automatically makes me think "Crazy Rich Asians" - a cultural phenomenon. Now, where does this fall chronologically? The first book, "Crazy Rich Asians," came out in, what was it, 2013? Then, "China Rich Girlfriend," a couple years later... 2015, I think. Ah, and the final one, that's "Rich People Problems." The critical step now is confirming the release date. Quick internal checkâ€¦ yep, May 23, 2017, that's spot on.

Alright, the process is complete. "Rich People Problems" is the correct answer, and I'll deliver it now in the requested format.

Rich People Problems
