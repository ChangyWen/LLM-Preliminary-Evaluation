Alright, let's break this down. The user needs a specific Stephen King book, released on a given date â€“ September 15, 1986. I know the drill; concise answers are key.

First things first, I'll distill the core components. The user's asking for a book, by King, with a specific publication date. That's straightforward. My expertise is in identifying these sorts of details, so I won't waste any time.

Now, onto the good stuff. Let's tap into that mental catalog, specifically the mid-1980s, that sweet spot for King's seminal work. I'll quickly cycle through the likely candidates. *It* immediately pops into mind. It's a huge book, released right around then, and a major cultural touchstone. *The Talisman*, co-written with Straub, was earlier in 1984, and then the classics, *Pet Sematary*, *Christine*, *Cujo*. My instincts are yelling, "It," but I'm never one to assume, so I'll double check just to be certain. A quick mental confirmation...September 15th, 1986. Bingo!

The format is crucial too. New line at the end. No problem. It's a simple task, and the answer is clear. Let's provide it.

The famous book by Stephen King that was released on September 15, 1986, is:
