*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's see. The user needs a specific book title. Hmm, crucial details are the author - Richard K. Morgan - and the release date: February 28th, 2002. Alright, my task is crystal clear: find a book by Morgan published on that precise date. Naturally, my brain jumps straight into search mode. I'd probably just query something like "Richard K. Morgan book 2002" or maybe get more specific with "Richard K. Morgan 2002-02-28 book".

Now, let's simulate the execution. I'm accessing my internal, or perhaps external, knowledge base of literary works, specifically Richard K. Morgan's bibliography. I know his work, and the usual suspects pop up: *Altered Carbon* immediately springs to mind as his debut. So, next step, check the release date of that novel. A quick consult of the reliable sources, Wikipedia, Goodreads, or similar, should easily confirm the publication date. Ah, yes, the UK edition of *Altered Carbon* indeed came out on February 28, 2002. Fantastic! The author, the year, the *exact* date â€“ it all aligns perfectly.

Alright, I've found the answer. Now, just formulate the answer and... oh yes, the formatting constraint. Right, the final answer goes on a new line. Simple enough.

*Altered Carbon*
