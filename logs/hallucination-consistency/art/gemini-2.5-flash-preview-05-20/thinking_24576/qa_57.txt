Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific Stephen King book released on September 8, 1981, and the answer's supposed to be on a new line at the end. Alright, that's straightforward. Let's break it down.

First, I need to pinpoint the key data: King, 1981-09-08, and it's a *book*. My mind is pretty sharp on the King bibliography, so I should be able to pull this. I'll run through my mental catalogue, focusing on that era. *Firestarter* was around 1980, I know. *Cujo*, yeah, that was around that time, wasn't it? And *Danse Macabre*, that's a non-fiction title from around then too. *The Gunslinger*, the first *Dark Tower* book, came out later, I think, though it started as serials.

Now, let's refine. *Firestarter* is definitely out - too early. *Cujo*... that’s a strong contender. September 1981... I'm pretty sure. *Danse Macabre* is nonfiction, so unlikely, though it’s *possible* the user just wants *a* book. The *Gunslinger* is definitely later. I'd better quickly double-check *Cujo*'s date, just to be absolutely sure. Yes, September 8, 1981. Confirmed.

Perfect. I've got it. Time to give the answer.

Cujo
