Alright, let's break this down. The user needs the name of a famous book by Deborah Feldman, released on Valentine's Day 2012, and they want the answer neatly formatted. Okay, simple enough. I'll immediately focus on the core elements: Deborah Feldman, February 14th, 2012, and "book."

I’ll probably just do a quick mental search; if I'm using a search engine, I’d likely query "Deborah Feldman book February 14 2012" or something similar. Honestly, just typing in "Deborah Feldman books" or maybe even "Deborah Feldman 2012" should do the trick.

The name "Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots" immediately springs to mind. Now, let me just quickly verify. Deborah Feldman? Check. Published on February 14th, 2012? Let's double-check that... yep, it lines up. And of course, it's a very well-known book, especially after its adaptation.

Perfect. Final answer:

Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots
