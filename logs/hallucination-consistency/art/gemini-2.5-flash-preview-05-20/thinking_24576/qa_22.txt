*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here’s my thought process in tackling this question. First, I need to break down the request itself: it's asking for a book, a famous book, specifically by Yann Martel, and it highlights a specific release date, September 11th, 2001. My immediate thought is, "Right, that’s *Life of Pi*." It’s pretty much *the* book Martel is known for, and given the timing around September 11th, I’m almost certain that’s it.

Next, I have to confirm that detail. I recall the book being released in September 2001, and while the exact day might be slightly off, it was certainly around that timeframe. A quick mental check, or if I had the resources handy, a search to verify the exact date would seal the deal, which I assume is necessary to satisfy the prompt. *Life of Pi* won the Booker Prize, so it's certainly famous, and it became a successful film. So, all the pieces fit.

Now, I'm synthesizing everything. Martel, famous book, around 9/11/2001. That leads to the correct answer, *Life of Pi*. Finally, I need to formulate the response, remembering the instructions. I'll state the answer clearly and then add a new line with the final answer, as requested.

Life of Pi
