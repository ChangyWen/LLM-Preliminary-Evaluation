Alright, let's break this down. The user needs a specific Stephen King book, released on a precise date – June 8th, 1987. Okay, so I immediately zero in on the essentials: Author is King, and the date is the key. *June 8th, 1987.* Time to consult my, shall we say, extensive mental library on King's bibliography. I'll probably just think along the lines of "King, 1987, books" to jog my memory. Then I check. Hold on… I'm pretty sure… Yes! *Misery*! Released on that very date. Perfect. King, check. Date, check. Famous book, check. Alright, final answer, clean and simple. Here it is.

*Misery*
