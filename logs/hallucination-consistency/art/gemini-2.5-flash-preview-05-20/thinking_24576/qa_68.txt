Alright, here's what I'm thinking. The task is crystal clear: find a Lionel Shriver book published on April 14th, 2003. My process for this is pretty streamlined.

First, I'm going to formulate the search. It's likely that I'd use something like "Lionel Shriver book 2003-04-14" or perhaps if I wasn't already confident, I'd go directly for "Lionel Shriver We Need to Talk About Kevin release date" since I already have a strong suspicion.

Next, I'd quickly verify my hunch with a search. I'm sure I'm right, but I'll always confirm it to ensure accuracy.

Then, and only then, after all that, I will state the name of the book.

Finally, place the answer on its own line.

*We Need to Talk About Kevin*
