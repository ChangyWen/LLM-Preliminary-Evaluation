Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to figure out which Dean Koontz book came out on May 10, 1981. The prompt is very specific, so that's the core task.

To get started, I'll formulate a few search queries in my head â€“ something like "Dean Koontz book May 10 1981," "Dean Koontz 1981 book release," and maybe "Dean Koontz 1981 novels." I could run these in my preferred search engine, or the knowledge might be readily accessible. Let's assume I've got a good mental database of Koontz releases, so I can probably recall it.

Now, the search phase... I think I remember that *The Mask* by Dean Koontz came out around that time. It's possible the exact release date, May 10th, is a bit hazy. Some resources might just say "May 1981."

To be absolutely sure, I need to verify the author and the year. Yep, Dean Koontz, 1981... *The Mask* sounds right.

Therefore, I'll state the answer clearly, on a new line as requested.

*The Mask*
