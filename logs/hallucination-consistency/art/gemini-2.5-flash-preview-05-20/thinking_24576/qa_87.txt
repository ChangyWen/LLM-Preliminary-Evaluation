Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to find a specific book by Jodi Picoult that came out on a certain date: April 6, 2004. Right, let's formulate the search query. I'll try something like "Jodi Picoult book 2004 April 6" or maybe "Jodi Picoult 2004 release date" - that should do the trick. Now, let's execute that search, either in my head by recalling my expertise, or by looking it up. Aha, I immediately recall that *My Sister's Keeper* by Jodi Picoult was released on April 6th, 2004. Now, let's just double-check the author and date, just to be sure, Jodi Picoult, April 6, 2004... Yup, confirmed. Okay, time to state the answer clearly.

*My Sister's Keeper*
