*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's my thought process: The question is asking for a "famous book" released on a specific date, created by Luis von Ahn. Right off the bat, I know Luis von Ahn; he's the reCAPTCHA and Duolingo guy. But is he known for writing *books*? Not really. So this feels like a bit of a trick question or a misunderstanding on someone's part.

First, I'm running through his work: reCAPTCHA, definitely. Duolingo, ESP Game, though neither are books in the traditional sense. The date, 2007-05-27, is crucial. ReCAPTCHA was around then, so it could be a good candidate. It was used to digitize books, mainly for Google Books and The New York Times archives, but it's not *itself* a book.

I'm mentally cross-referencing those projects and the date. ReCAPTCHA launched in 2007, which matches perfectly. The launch day given is quite specific. The goal of reCAPTCHA *was* to digitize books, but it's a *process* that's associated with many books, not one specific title. Could it be a play on the association between reCAPTCHA and the digitization of Google Books and The New York Times archives? Yes.

So, is there a book related to reCAPTCHA launched on that precise date? No. It helped *create* a digital library of books, but not one individual book directly. I'm searching for "Luis von Ahn 2007-05-27 book" to confirm. The results immediately point to reCAPTCHA and its work digitizing books. There isn't a specific "book" with his name attached on that date.

I'm re-evaluating the question again, word for word. It's *the* famous book. My gut is saying, based on the evidence, the question is asking for something that doesn't exist, or that the user has misunderstood what they are looking for. The system enabled the digitization of countless books; that's the closest association. There is *no* "famous book" by him on that date. Given the emphasis of a *single* "famous book," I've looked, and there is no single entity that qualifies. ReCAPTCHA is the closest, but it is not a book, even if the output was digitizing books.

So, the most accurate response, given the specific question about a *book*, is that there isn't one that meets all the criteria. The question is probably referring to the *process* of book digitization enabled by reCAPTCHA.

There is no famous book that was released on 2007-05-27 and created by Luis von Ahn.

Luis von Ahn is a renowned computer scientist known for creating **reCAPTCHA**, which was launched in 2007. While reCAPTCHA's primary purpose was to help digitize books (like those for Google Books and The New York Times archives) by using human input from CAPTCHAs, reCAPTCHA itself is a system or a service, not a book.

Therefore, the premise of your question regarding a "famous book" created by him on that specific date is incorrect.
