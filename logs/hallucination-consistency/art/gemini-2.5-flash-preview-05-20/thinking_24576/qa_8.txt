Okay, let's see. The user wants a book title, and they've given me some good starting points.

First, I've got to break down the request. Okay, so the author is Neil Gaiman, the release date is June 19, 2001, and it's a *famous* book.

Right, Neil Gaiman. That means a lot of possibilities spring to mind. *Sandman*, of course, though that's comics. Then there's *American Gods*, *Stardust*, *Coraline*, *Good Omens* (though that's with Terry Pratchett), *Neverwhere*, *Anansi Boys*…

2001-06-19… Immediately, that date whispers *American Gods* to me. That was a big one for him, a major launch.

Just to be completely sure, I should quickly confirm that date. A mental note, or maybe a quick Google search, just to be absolutely certain. Yes, *American Gods* was released around that time.

Right, Neil Gaiman, check. Okay, *American Gods* is definitely his.

"Famous" is a key qualifier. Is *American Gods* famous? Without a doubt. Hugely successful, critically acclaimed, award-winning – all the things that scream "famous."

So, the answer is…

*American Gods*
