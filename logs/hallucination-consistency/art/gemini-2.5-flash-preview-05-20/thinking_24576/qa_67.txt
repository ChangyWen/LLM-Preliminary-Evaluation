Okay, here's what's going through my mind. The user wants a specific book, and they've given me some clues: the release date, 2016-01-12, the author, Paul Kalanithi, and the implication that it's a well-known book.

Right away, "Paul Kalanithi" triggers my internal neurosurgeon-memoir radar. I know he's associated with a highly impactful, and very famous, book about his experience with cancer. Now, what was the title...? Oh yeah, "When Breath Becomes Air."

Hmm, release date. I'm pretty sure that's correct, given the book's prominence and timing, but to be completely sure, I could justâ€¦ I instantly know that release date is correct, given how prominent the book and it's release actually was.

Okay, author is confirmed, title confirmed. Now, assemble the response to the user's request, following all the given prompts, and make sure to end on a new line.

When Breath Becomes Air
