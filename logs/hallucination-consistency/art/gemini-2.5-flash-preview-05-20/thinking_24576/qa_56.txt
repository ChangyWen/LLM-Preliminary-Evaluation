Right, let's see. The core of this is straightforward: pinpoint an Agatha Christie novel published on November 3rd, 1958. My approach is already formulated. I’ll mentally frame the search with a concise set of keywords: "Agatha Christie", "1958-11-03", and, of course, "book".

My expertise kicks in now. I'd immediately either cross-reference in my own memory – I know her bibliography intimately – or, more likely for speed, I’d formulate a quick search. Something like “Agatha Christie book 1958” or maybe “Agatha Christie November 3 1958” would do the trick.

Ah, yes, the result should be obvious. That search would immediately pull up *Ordeal by Innocence*. But, as an expert, I don’t just rely on recall; I need verification. A quick check is essential. I'd confirm the publication date – yes, November 3rd, 1958 is the consistent date.

Now to format the answer. The prompt specifies the answer needs to be on a new line at the end. So, to construct the final output: "The famous book by Agatha Christie released on 1958-11-03 is Ordeal by Innocence."

*Ordeal by Innocence*
