Okay, let's see. The user needs a book. They've given me the essentials: a specific release date – January 1, 2008 – and the author's name, Garth Stein. So, the task is straightforward: find a book by Garth Stein that fits this date.

My first move, naturally, is to mentally formulate a search query. Either a general one like "Garth Stein book 2008" or, if a specific title springs to mind, a more targeted one. I think I already have a pretty good idea. Garth Stein... 2008... the name "The Art of Racing in the Rain" is practically popping into my head.

Next step: retrieval. I'll quickly sift through my knowledge base. Yes, that's it, "The Art of Racing in the Rain" is Stein's most recognizable work. Now, verify, verify, verify. Is Stein the author? Check. Was the release date January 1, 2008? I'm almost certain, but a quick fact-check is essential. Yep, correct.

And now, the final step: I need to construct and present the answer, ensuring it's crystal clear and, importantly, on its own line.

The Art of Racing in the Rain
