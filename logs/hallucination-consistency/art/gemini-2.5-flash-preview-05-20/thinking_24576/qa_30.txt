Okay, let's break this down. The user wants a specific book by Robert A. Heinlein, published on November 5, 1959. Right, so Heinlein… immediately my mind jumps to the usual suspects: *Stranger in a Strange Land*, *Starship Troopers*, *The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress*… and a few others. Now, given the date constraint, I'm thinking *Starship Troopers*. I'm almost certain that was around that time. Let me just… yeah, quick mental check, maybe 1959? Alright, let's nail down the date. Hmm, I remember it being close, but is it *exactly* November 5th? No. Wait... December 1959, isn't it?

So, *Starship Troopers* is the most likely candidate for a "famous book" from Heinlein, but not *exactly* the correct date. Okay, let me double check. Hmm... Maybe there's a different book by him from that time? I'll do a quick search to be sure. Right, nothing seems to fit that *exact* date, Nov 5, 1959, and even if there were, it likely won't be as *famous* as *Starship Troopers*. 

Okay. Time for some critical thinking. Is the date absolutely critical here? Could there be a slight fuzziness in the user's memory? The question is asking for "the famous book." *Starship Troopers* is *the* iconic Heinlein book from that era, right? Well, let's check the *exact* date one more time. Hmm, seems the book itself was released in December. Ah ha! Now I remember. the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction serialized it under a different name in October and November, before the book version. The user is probably referring to the serialization and the book's release in relation to it. Given the "famous book" constraint, and the November link via the serialization, I think I have the answer. It all fits. Okay, let's get this done.

Starship Troopers
