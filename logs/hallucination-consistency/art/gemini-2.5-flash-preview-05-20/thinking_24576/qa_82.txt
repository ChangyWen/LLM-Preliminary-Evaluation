Right, let's tackle this. The user wants to know a Joël Dicker book released on September 19, 2012. Okay, simple enough. First, I'll need to search for it. I'll start with a few key phrases, like "Joël Dicker book 2012-09-19" and perhaps "Joël Dicker 2012 book." I might also try "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair release date" just in case. Now, let's run that search, either mentally or using my resources. Ah, yes. *The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair* (or *La Vérité sur l'affaire Harry Quebert* in the original French) immediately springs to mind. It was his breakout novel and published around that time. Now, to pinpoint the exact date, I'll need to verify the release. Wikipedia and other reputable book sites will be the place to check, and yes, September 19, 2012, seems to be the date cited for the French publication. Excellent. Okay, the answer is clear. Time to format the response.

*The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair*
