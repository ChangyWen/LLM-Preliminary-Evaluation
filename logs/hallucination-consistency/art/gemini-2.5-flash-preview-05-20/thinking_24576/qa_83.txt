Alright, let's see. The request is straightforward: find a Joël Dicker book published on September 19, 2012. My first instinct, naturally, is to formulate a search strategy. I'll start with the most direct approach: "Joël Dicker book 2012-09-19". Just in case, I should broaden that out a bit with "Joël Dicker 2012 book" and maybe even try something specific, like "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair release date." Now, time for the search, either mentally or via a quick Google. Aha! *The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair* – that was his big one. Let me just verify the date quickly. I'll check a reliable source, like Wikipedia, and cross-reference with other book databases. Ah yes, September 2012, often listed as September 19, 2012. Excellent. The answer is clear, and I'll make sure it's formatted properly.

*La Vérité sur l'affaire Harry Quebert*
