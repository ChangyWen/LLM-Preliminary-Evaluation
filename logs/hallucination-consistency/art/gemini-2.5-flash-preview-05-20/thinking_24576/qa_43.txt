Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous book, and they've given me some clues. The author is Michael Ende, and the release date is September 1st, 1979. Right, so I need to find a book from Ende from that timeframe.

I'll focus on Ende's most popular works, since the request says "famous". Let's see... *Momo* and *The Neverending Story* immediately spring to mind. *Momo* was earlier, though, so that's probably out. I'll quickly check the datesâ€¦ *Momo*, 1973. *The Neverending Story*... ah yes, *Die unendliche Geschichte*, published in 1979. That fits perfectly.

The date is confirmed, and *The Neverending Story* is definitely a contender for his most famous work. The film adaptations helped that, too.

The answer is clear then.

*The Neverending Story*
