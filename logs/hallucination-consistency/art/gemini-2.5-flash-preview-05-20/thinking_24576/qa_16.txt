Okay, let's see. The user needs a specific book, let's break this down. Right, so the request is for a Jenny Han book, and it's got to meet a few criteria. Release date of May 26, 2015. And, crucially, it's supposed to be *famous*.

Right. So, I'll probably just do a quick search, or more accurately, I'll pull it from memory, given my expertise. "Jenny Han 2015 book," or maybe "Jenny Han book released May 26 2015."

Jenny Han. Ah, yes. A popular YA author. "To All the Boys I've Loved Before," that's her big one, right? Let me check that. The first one came out in... 2014, I think? Yep. So, that's not it, because we need 2015.

What else did she write around then? "The Summer I Turned Pretty?" No, those were earlier. Hmmm. Let me see... Standalone novels? Unlikely, given her style. Sequels, thoughâ€¦ yes!

Alright, so, the date is the key here: May 26, 2015. Let's think about the *sequels* to "To All the Boys I've Loved Before." Book 1, 2014. Book 2... that was... *P.S. I Still Love You* (2015). And *Always and Forever, Lara Jean* was a few years later.

Okay, let's just confirm *P.S. I Still Love You* was actually May 26, 2015. I'll double-check the release date. Yes, there it is!

And, is it "famous"? Well, it's the sequel to a massive hit. Also, adapted into a movie, right? Yeah, totally fits the bill.

Okay, got it. The answer:

P.S. I Still Love You
