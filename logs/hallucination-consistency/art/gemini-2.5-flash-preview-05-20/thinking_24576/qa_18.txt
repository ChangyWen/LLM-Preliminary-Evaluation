Okay, let's see. The user needs a book by Jay Asher, released in late 2007, and it's supposedly quite well-known. Right off the bat, Jay Asher screams "one particular book" to me. Let's see... *Thirteen Reasons Why*. Or, hmm, is it *13 Reasons Why*? I'm fairly certain that's it. I know it was a big hit. Wait, wasn't that around 2007? Yeah, it feels like it. I should probably check that date just to be sure. Okay, give me a sec... ah yes, October 18, 2007, the original hardcover. Excellent!

*Thirteen Reasons Why*
