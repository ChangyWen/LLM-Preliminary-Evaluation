Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking for a specific book, and I need to deduce which one. Let's see, the key details are: a release date of April 12, 2005, the author is Stephen Dubner, and it's implied to be a well-known or popular book. Hmm, Stephen Dubner... Right! Dubner is famously known for his collaborations with Steven Levitt. That rings a bell. The most prominent work they did together... *Freakonomics*. Now, let's quickly verify the specifics. Okay, "Freakonomics release date"... a quick search should do the trick. Ah, perfect! April 12th, 2005. And *Freakonomics* definitely fits the bill for a famous, widely read book; it was a huge bestseller and really influenced the field. Alright, I'm confident in my answer.

*Freakonomics*
