Right, let's break this down. The task is to find a specific book based on its author and a specific date. Okay, so I need to identify a Pierce Brown book released on January 28, 2014.

My search strategy is pretty straightforward. I could just Google "Pierce Brown book 2014-01-28" to begin with, or perhaps even try "Pierce Brown first book release date" if I want to get even more specific.

A quick mental (or, if needed, actual) search... Ah, yes! *Red Rising* – it's Pierce Brown's debut novel and it was released on… yes, January 28th, 2014.

Now, let's verify. Author: Pierce Brown? Check. Release date: January 28, 2014? Double-check. And is this a well-known book? Definitely. *Red Rising* is the start of a major, highly-regarded series.

Excellent. Therefore, I'm ready to formulate the response. Here's the name.

*Red Rising*
