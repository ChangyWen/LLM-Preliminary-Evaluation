Okay, let me break this down. The user wants a specific book, and they've given me the critical pieces of information: the release date, the author, and the implicit assumption that it's a well-known work. Right away, the author, Steven Levitt, immediately screams "Freakonomics" in my mind. Now, I need to quickly verify that the 2005-04-12 release date is accurate for *that* book. A quick mental scan...yes, that date rings true. Good. And of course, *Freakonomics* is hugely famous, so that checks out too. Therefore, the answer is clear.

Freakonomics
