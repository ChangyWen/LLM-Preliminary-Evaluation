Okay, let's see. The user needs the title of a famous book. They've given me the author, Truman Capote, and a release date, January 17, 1966. Alright, so I need to tap into my knowledge of Capote's bibliography, focusing on works from around that timeframe. Immediately, "In Cold Blood" pops into my mind. It's Capote's magnum opus and certainly the most likely answer given those parameters. I quickly confirm the date... yes, January 17, 1966, that's the established publication date. Perfect. Now, I'll deliver the answer.

In Cold Blood
