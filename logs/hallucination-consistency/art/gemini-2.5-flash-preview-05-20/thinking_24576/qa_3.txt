Okay, here's what's going through my head. The user wants me to identify a famous book. Right, I have the basic criteria: a release date, the author, and a hint that it's a notable work. The author is Joseph Heller. Immediately, the name "Joseph Heller" shouts *Catch-22*. Now, I just need to confirm the details.

Let's see. *Catch-22*... I'm pretty sure the publication date is spot on. A quick mental recall... yes, 1961. And the date? October 10th. Perfect. Furthermore, the "famous" part is a given. *Catch-22* is *the* quintessential anti-war satire, a cornerstone of modern literature. So, based on the provided information, it's unequivocally *Catch-22*.

Final Answer:
Catch-22
