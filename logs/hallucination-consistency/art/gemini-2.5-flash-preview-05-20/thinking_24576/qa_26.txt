Okay, here's what's going through my head. Someone's asking for the name of a famous book. They've given me a few clues to work with: the release date, the author, and that the book is well-known. Alright, let's see. February 1, 1999, and Stephen Chbosky... that immediately rings a bell. Chboskyâ€¦ yes, I know exactly what this is likely to be. I'm pretty sure it's *The Perks of Being a Wallflower*. But I'll quickly verify. Right, *Perks of Being a Wallflower* by Stephen Chbosky. That matches the author. And the release date, February 1, 1999. Yep, that's correct! Plus, the fame... definitely famous. A modern classic, especially in the YA genre, and a successful film adaptation to boot. It checks all the boxes. So, I'm confident in the answer. And they want the final answer on a new line. Got it.

The Perks of Being a Wallflower
