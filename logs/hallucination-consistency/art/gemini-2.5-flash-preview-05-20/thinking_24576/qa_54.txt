Okay, let's see. The user needs a specific book, and they've given me the key data points: author, release date, and imply it's a well-known title. Right, 2013-10-10, Greg Sestero... my mind immediately jumps to "The Room," Tommy Wiseau, and the whole cult phenomenon. Sestero wrote a book... was it related to "The Room"? *Yes.* Ah, "The Disaster Artist!" The co-author was Tom Bissell, and it became incredibly well-known, especially after the movie. But when was it published? The release date is the key. 2013, I *think*, and I *believe* it was in October... Gotta be sure. Let me quickly double-check. Yes! Searching "The Disaster Artist release date" now... And confirm it's indeed 2013-10-10. Perfect.

The Disaster Artist
