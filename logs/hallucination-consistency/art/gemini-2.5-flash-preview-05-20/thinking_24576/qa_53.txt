Okay, here's what's going through my head: The user wants the name of a famous book, giving me the release date, author, and implying a certain level of recognition. Easy enough. First, the author's Shirley Jackson â€“ immediately, I think of *The Lottery*, *The Haunting of Hill House*, and *We Have Always Lived in the Castle*. Okay, next step, the date. 1962-09-21... *The Lottery* is out. *The Haunting of Hill House* too. That date screams *We Have Always Lived in the Castle*! Now, just to be sure, I'll double check the publication date. Yup, nailed it. And yes, definitely famous. A classic of the genre, well-loved, and critically acclaimed. Right, the answer is clear. Now, just have to follow their formatting instructions.

We Have Always Lived in the Castle
