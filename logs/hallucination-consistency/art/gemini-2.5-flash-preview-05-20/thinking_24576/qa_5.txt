Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a specific Stephen King book, and they've given me the release date â€“ a very specific one, October 3rd, 1978. Alright, I need to deliver the book title, and that's *the* answer.

First, break it down. Author is King, date is crucial. Now, my mental filing cabinet is already scanning those years. Hmm...1978. Right away, *The Stand* comes to mind. It was a behemoth, and I'm almost certain it was around that time.

So, I need to confirm, and quickly. I'm probably visualizing the cover right now and checking the publishing history in my head. Okay, yep. Confirmation. That's it. The date aligns perfectly. This is easy.

Therefore, the book is:
The Stand
