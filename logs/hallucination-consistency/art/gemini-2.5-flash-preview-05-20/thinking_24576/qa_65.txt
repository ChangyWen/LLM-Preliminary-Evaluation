Okay, let's break this down. The prompt wants me to identify a famous book. Easy enough.

First, I need to define the parameters. Okay, author is Frank McCourt and the publication date is September 5, 1996. That's all I need, but I'll treat this like any good query and do it right.

Right off the bat, I think of McCourt as the author of *that* memoir. He's really known for that one thing, *Angela's Ashes*, right? Ah, yeah. I'll need to verify the date, just to be absolutely sure, but I'm pretty confident. Let me just pull that up... yep. 1996. Perfect. Now, the fame part. Yup, *Angela's Ashes* is definitely famous. Pulitzer Prize winner, big deal.

Okay. I'm good to go.

Angela's Ashes
