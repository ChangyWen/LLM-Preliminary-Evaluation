Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific book, and they've given me the details: a release date of November 9th, 1984, and the author, Douglas Adams. It's implied to be a well-known work, a classic probably. Adams... immediately my mind jumps to *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*. Right, let's quickly run through the release dates to nail this. Okay, the original novel was 1979, then *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe* in 1980, *Life, the Universe and Everything* in 1982. Ah! Then *So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish* in 1984, and finally *Mostly Harmless* in 1992. And the date they gave me was... November 9th, 1984! Bingo. That *So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish*, of course, part of the Hitchhiker series. Definitely a famous book, within a very famous series, so no problem there. Alright, now to give the answer.

*So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish*
