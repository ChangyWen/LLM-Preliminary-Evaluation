Okay, let's see. The user wants a book, a "famous book" by George Saunders. Alright. George Saunders... right, he's a major contemporary American author, known more recently for his novel than for his short stories, though both are excellent. The "famous book" - it's almost certainly *Lincoln in the Bardo*. Let me just double-check that release date... yeah, that sounds about right, 2017. Give me a quick search here: "Lincoln in the Bardo release date"... Yep, February 14, 2017. And of course, it's famous; it won the Man Booker Prize that year. Definitely the right book. Okay, got it.

*Lincoln in the Bardo*
