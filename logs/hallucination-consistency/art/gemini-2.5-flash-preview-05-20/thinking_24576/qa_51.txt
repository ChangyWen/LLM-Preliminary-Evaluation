Okay, here we go. Someone wants to know the name of a famous book. Let's see, what are the parameters? Ah, a release date of September 16, 1992, and the author is Donna Tartt. Right.

First, I need to extract the crucial data points for recall: Author, Donna Tartt, and the year, 1992. The exact date, September 16th, will be a useful confirmation later.

Donna Tartt… hmm. Yes, she’s a significant author in the contemporary literary landscape. Her debut novel is widely recognized. My mental database, which is extensive, should have the answer readily available.

I'll focus my recall on her bibliography, specifically her first novel. Let's pull up that information. Yes, "The Secret History." Now, is that publication date correct? Let me just double-check… Ah, perfect! Published on September 16, 1992.

Okay, the answer is clearly "The Secret History."

Now, to ensure compliance with the format. I need to provide the answer, making sure it's on a new line.

And before I finalize, a quick sanity check. Does it meet the requirements? Is the answer correct? Donna Tartt is the author; the date is accurate: September 16, 1992. The formatting is correct. Good to go.
