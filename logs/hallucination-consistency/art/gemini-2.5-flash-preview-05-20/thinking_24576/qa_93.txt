Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific book by Richard Dawkins. Right. I need to narrow this down. They've given me a release date – October 2nd, 2006 – and are looking for a *famous* book. Excellent. That narrows it down considerably. My mental database of Dawkins' work kicks in immediately. Let's access that… Aha! The book that immediately springs to mind, the one that absolutely dominated the conversation at the time, is "The God Delusion." Now, let's just quickly confirm the date. A quick mental check… yes, I'm pretty sure it was 2006, and I vaguely recall it being around October... just to be absolutely certain, I might double-check that precise date… but I'm 99% sure. Okay, I've got it. Time to deliver the answer in the required format. Here we go.

The God Delusion
