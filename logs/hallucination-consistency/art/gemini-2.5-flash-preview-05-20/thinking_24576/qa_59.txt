Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The prompt is asking me to pinpoint a specific Heinlein book released on a very specific date: June 1, 1961. Right, so first thing, I need to figure out what book that is.

My instinct, from my knowledge of Heinlein and publication dates, tells me it's probably "Stranger in a Strange Land". But I'll have to use some search terms to be absolutely certain, and to make sure the date is correct. I’ll try a quick search using terms like "Robert A. Heinlein book 1961 June 1" and maybe throw in "Robert A. Heinlein 1961 novel" to narrow things down.

A mental check – or a quick query – will tell me if I'm right. Yep, "Stranger in a Strange Land" pops to mind immediately. Now I just need to verify that publication date… June 1, 1961. And I'm fairly confident about that too.

Alright, so the answer is pretty straightforward at this point. I just need to formulate the response clearly and make sure it's on a new line, like the prompt instructs.

Stranger in a Strange Land
