Alright, let's get this done. The task is clear: pinpoint a Murakami book published on May 29, 2009. Straightforward. First things first, I need to formulate a search strategy. My mental keywords are "Haruki Murakami," "book," "2009-05-29," and "released" – that should be a good starting point for any search engine. Now, let's execute – probably a simple Google query: "Haruki Murakami book May 29 2009." Hmm… right away, *1Q84* pops up. Of course. But, I always verify. Let’s confirm that release date. Wikipedia or another reputable source – absolutely, May 29, 2009, is the date of the initial Japanese publication for *1Q84*, Books 1 and 2. Excellent. Okay, the answer is certain. Now, to provide the response clearly.

*1Q84*
