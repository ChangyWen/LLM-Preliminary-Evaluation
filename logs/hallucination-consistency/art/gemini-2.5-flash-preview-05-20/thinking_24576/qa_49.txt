Okay, let's break this down. The user wants the name of a Dominick Dunne book released on September 13, 2007. Right, Dunne. A master of the true crime and society scene, known for his meticulous detail and sharp observations. "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles," "An Inconvenient Woman"... those are the ones that come to mind. Now, September 13, 2007... Let's see, I need to jog my memory, or maybe a quick search will do. Checking my mental library... Dunne's primary output was earlier, definitely. "Season in Purgatory" was his last novel, wasn't it? And there was the collection of essays... "Justice"... from 2001, I believe. And the memoir, "The Way We Lived Then" published in 2006.

Ah, here's the crux of it. The date doesn't match up with any major new release. He passed away in 2009. This is a classic conundrum. It's possible the user has the author or the date wrong. Or maybe it was a re-release, something obscure... but based on my knowledge of Dunne's body of work, there's no *new* book matching that date. I can't just invent something. The prompt specifically asks for "the name of the book," so I can't just state a year. If there isn't a book, there isn't a name.

So, I need to be clear, professional, and explain the situation. I'll state that no book was released on that date, back it up with his known bibliography, and gently suggest there might be a misunderstanding. And then, because the prompt demands a single line answer, the final answer *must* reflect the reality that the premise itself is false.

Dominick Dunne did not release a new book on September 13, 2007. His last major work, a memoir titled *The Way We Lived Then: Recollections of a Well-Known Name Dropper*, was published in 2006. He passed away in 2009. It's possible there might be a misunderstanding regarding the author or the publication date.

There is no famous book by Dominick Dunne released on September 13, 2007.
