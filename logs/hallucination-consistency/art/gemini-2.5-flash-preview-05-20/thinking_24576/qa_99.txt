Alright, let's break this down. The user wants a book title, and they've given me the release date and author. Let's see... Scott Lynch, 2006. That's pretty easy; I'd wager they're looking for the first *Gentlemen Bastards* novel.

Okay, time to confirm my suspicion. I'll quickly pull up my internal catalog of fantasy authors and their works, specifically remembering that *The Lies of Locke Lamora* is the debut novel of Scott Lynch, and that it was released back in 2006. Yep, absolutely. I'm also reasonably sure that that's the name of the first book in the *Gentlemen Bastards* series. 

Yes, I knew that one. Now, let's just confirm the author to be entirely accurate. Yup, I'm confident the answer is *The Lies of Locke Lamora*. So, I'll deliver that nice and clean.

*The Lies of Locke Lamora*
