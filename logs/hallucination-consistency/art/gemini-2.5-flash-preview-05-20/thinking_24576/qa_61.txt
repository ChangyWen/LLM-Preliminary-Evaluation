Okay, let's see. The user needs the name of a famous book, and they've given me some clues. Right, so, release date: August 24, 2010. Author: Suzanne Collins. And they're implying it's a well-known book. Hmm... Suzanne Collins... immediately my mind goes to *The Hunger Games*. I know she's best known for that series. Let me quickly run through those titles in my head… *The Hunger Games*, *Catching Fire*, and *Mockingjay*. I should probably check those release dates to be certain.

*The Hunger Games* was 2008... *Catching Fire* was 2009... and *Mockingjay*... yes! August 24th, 2010! That's the one! Perfect match for the date. And of course, it’s Collins. And *Mockingjay* is definitely a famous book. It concluded a massive series. So, I'm confident. Now to formulate the answer… make sure I get the formatting right. Okay, here goes…

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Mockingjay
