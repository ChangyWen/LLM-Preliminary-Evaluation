Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific book, and they've given me some good starting clues. They're looking for something published on March 7, 2000, by Mark Z. Danielewski, and the request implies it's a well-known title. Right, time to tap into the old memory banks, or at least, a mental index of significant authors and publications. Danielewski... I'm reasonably certain I have something on that. Okay, author, date, those are the key parameters. Let's see, Danielewski... March 7, 2000... Bingo. There's only one book that really stands out in my mind that fits this description, a truly *memorable* piece of work. The implication here is fame, and that narrows things down considerably. Yes, yes, that's it. Just to be absolutely certain, a quick internal cross-reference confirms my initial thought. And *House of Leaves*, that's it. Now, one last check: yep, March 7, 2000. Perfect.

*House of Leaves*
