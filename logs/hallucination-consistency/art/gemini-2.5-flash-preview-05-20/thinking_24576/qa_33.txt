Okay, let's see. The user wants a book, specifically from Michael Lewis. They're also giving me some very helpful clues: the release date is June 17, 2003, and it's a "famous book." Right, so the first thing I do is pull up my mental Rolodex of Lewis's books. *Liar's Poker*, of course, and *The New New Thing*. Then there's *Moneyball*, *The Big Short*, *Flash Boys*, and *The Blind Side*. Hmm, date-wise... *Liar's Poker* is way off, and *The New New Thing* too. I *think* *Moneyball* might fit the timeframe of early 2000s. Now let's see... yes, a quick mental refresh, and I'm almost certain, that was June 17th, 2003. Perfect. And it's *definitely* famous â€“ Brad Pitt, the whole deal. *The Big Short*, *Flash Boys*, and *The Blind Side*, are all too late. *Moneyball* it is.

*Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game*
