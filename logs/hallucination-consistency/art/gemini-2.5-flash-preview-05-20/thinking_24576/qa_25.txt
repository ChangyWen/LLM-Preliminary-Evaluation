Okay, let's break this down. The prompt is straightforward: name a famous book, specifically one from Jack Kerouac. Right, so that immediately triggers the Kerouac association. My mind jumps to his most well-known work, the one that really cemented his legacy. Let's see... I believe it was published sometime around... 1957. I should verify the exact date to be certain, but I'm fairly confident, especially if the request specifies a 1957 release. I know the title, it's that quintessential beat generation novel. Yes, I'm feeling pretty confident with my answer, it's the one everyone associates with him.

*On the Road*
