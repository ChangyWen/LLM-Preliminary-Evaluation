Alright, let's get this done. The user needs a book title, specifically a Michael Crichton, and it has a release date constraint. Okay, so I need to find a Michael Crichton book, released on or around November 20th, 1990. That's the core of it.

Right, my memory banks are pretty good when it comes to these things. I can access my internal database, so to speak, and I immediately think of *Jurassic Park*. Crichton, sci-fi, thrilling, all those characteristics scream *Jurassic Park*. Now, date… yeah, I'm almost certain that’s the one, but let's be absolutely certain, so a quick fact-check is in order. Yep, published November 20th, 1990. Perfect match. Author, release date, high profile – it's all there. Now, just need to format the answer correctly… final answer on a new line.

*Jurassic Park*
