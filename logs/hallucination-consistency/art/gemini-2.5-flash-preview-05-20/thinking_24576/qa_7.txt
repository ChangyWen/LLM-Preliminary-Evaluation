Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific book, right? And they've given me the author and the release date. No problem. First things first, I need to identify the critical data points: Stephen King and September 24th, 2013. Hmm, that's pretty specific. Now, how to find this book? I'd probably formulate a query, something like "Stephen King book released September 24 2013" or, to be more concise, "Stephen King 2013 book".

Right. Stephen King, the constant professional. I know the man's output is vast. But wait...I do recall a major release around that timeframe...wasn't there a sequel to *The Shining* around then? *Doctor Sleep*! Let me just double-check that release date... Yup, *Doctor Sleep* was indeed released on September 24th, 2013. Perfect. Author: Stephen King, check. Release date: September 24th, 2013, check. It's a notable book too, building on one of his most famous novels. Okay, seems I have the correct answer. Time to deliver.

Doctor Sleep
