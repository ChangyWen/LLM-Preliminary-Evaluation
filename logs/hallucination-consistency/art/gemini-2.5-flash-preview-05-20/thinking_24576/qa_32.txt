Okay, let's break this down. The prompt wants the name of a famous book. Hmm, with some specific constraints. July 2nd, 2002 release date, author Neil Gaiman. Easy enough, but I need to be precise. I'll work through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the key information is. It's a famous book, the date, and the author. Got it. Then there's the output format, which is just the book name on a new line. Got it.

Now, the strategy. I'll need to mentally run through Gaiman's work. I'll start by visualizing his major works, then go from there. *Sandman* is the obvious one, but that's not a book, right? Okay, moving on. *American Gods* is... 2001, no, that's out. *Stardust* is earlier. *Coraline*, *Good Omens*, *Neverwhere*... Those feel like theyâ€™re in the mix. *Anansi Boys* is later. *Graveyard Book* is even later.

Alright, 2002. Let's focus in. *Coraline* stands out. Now, I need to double-check the release date. I *think* it's the right one. A quick mental search will confirm. Yes! It's from July 2nd, 2002.

The "famous" criteria. *Coraline* is a massively successful book and a well-known film. Fits.

Alright, I'm confident. The answer is *Coraline*. And make sure the format is right.

*Coraline*
