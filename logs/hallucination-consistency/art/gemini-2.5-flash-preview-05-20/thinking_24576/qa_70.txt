Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous book. Right. Input is Chuck Palahniuk, released on August 17, 1996, and the output should be a single line.

First, I need to zero in on the crucial info: Palahniuk and that specific 1996 date. "Famous" means I should be looking for a widely recognized work, likely his most significant, or at least one of his early ones.

My mental Rolodex of literary knowledge immediately points me to "Fight Club". It's practically synonymous with Palahniuk. Now, I need to confirm the publication date. It *feels* right, but let's not guess.

Right. "Fight Club" *is* Palahniuk's debut novel. A quick internal check, or a tiny peek at my usual resources, confirms the release date: August 17, 1996. Perfect!

Alright, I've got the answer. Let me format it the way the user asked.

Fight Club
