Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous book. Right, that's the task. They've given me some specifics: author Eoin Colfer, and a release date of April 26th, 2001. Fine. I need to output the answer on a new line, understood.

So, what's the most effective way to tackle this? The critical pieces of information are clearly the author – Eoin Colfer – and that release year of 2001, down to the day. My brain immediately jumps into search mode. I'd either mentally formulate the query, "Eoin Colfer book released 2001" or, more specifically, "Eoin Colfer April 26 2001 book."

And... *boom*. My internal library, my memory and knowledge base, immediately flags "Artemis Fowl" by Eoin Colfer. That's the big one, and I *know* it was released around that time. Time to verify: is "Artemis Fowl" by Eoin Colfer? Absolutely. Was it released on April 26th, 2001? Yes, I'm almost positive. A quick mental check... yep, that's the release date for the first book in the series.

Alright. The book is "Artemis Fowl". Now, just to put it in the correct format, on a new line.

Artemis Fowl
