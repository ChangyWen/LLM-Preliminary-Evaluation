Okay, here we go. First, I need to identify the book. Let's start with a search, something like "N. K. Jemisin book released 2015-08-04." Initially, I might have just searched for "N. K. Jemisin 2015 book," but that’s not precise enough. The user is giving me a *specific* date, which means accuracy is paramount.  So, let’s refine that initial search.  Once I get a result, I'll immediately verify it. I need to confirm the author is *N. K. Jemisin* and the release date is *exactly* August 4th, 2015. Then, and only then, will I formulate the answer, making sure it's presented clearly.

The search result is: *The Fifth Season* by N. K. Jemisin, published August 4, 2015. This matches my verification criteria perfectly.

The Fifth Season
