Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific Michael Lewis book, released around March 15th, 2010, and it's supposed to be a well-known one. Alright, let's get to work. Michael Lewis... immediately my mental Rolodex of his work starts spinning. *Liar's Poker*, *The New New Thing*, *Moneyball*, *The Blind Side*, *The Big Short*, *Flash Boys*, *Boomerang*, *The Fifth Risk* â€“ all classics in their own right. But we need to filter by that 2010 release date.

Right, let's check the dates. 1989... no. 1999... nope. 2003... definitely not. 2006... still a no. Ah, here we go: *The Big Short*... March 15, 2010! That's it! That hits the date precisely. And, it's *extremely* famous, particularly after the film adaptation. Yep, that has to be it. The request, specifies a final answer, so I will oblige.

The book you are looking for is *The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine*.

The Big Short
