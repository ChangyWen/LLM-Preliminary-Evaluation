Okay, let's break this down. The user wants the name of a famous book, and they've given me the author and a specific release date. Right, Patricia Highsmith... immediately, psychological thrillers pop to mind. I know her key works: *Strangers on a Train*, *The Talented Mr. Ripley*, *Ripley's Game*, and *Deep Water*. Let's see... given the date, I'll mentally sift through my mental catalog of Highsmith's novels, paying close attention to their publication years. *Strangers on a Train* is too early. *The Talented Mr. Ripley*... 1955... that sounds promising! *Ripley's Game* is later, and so is *Deep Water*.

Now, *The Talented Mr. Ripley*. Highsmith wrote it, and it aligns with the 1955 date. But, to be certain, I'll quickly verify the exact release or publication date. A quick search for "The Talented Mr. Ripley release date" should do the trick. I suspect the 1955 date they provided lines up with its publication. Considering Highsmith's prominence and how well known *Ripley* is, matching the year like that is probably the answer.

*The Talented Mr. Ripley* is the most logical choice given the information, and a quick check of dates should confirm it.

*The Talented Mr. Ripley*
