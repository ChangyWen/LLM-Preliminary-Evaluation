Okay, here we go. Someone wants a book, a specific one, judging by the details provided. Right, so let's see... The key pieces are: the author, Jon Krakauer, and the publication date of January 13th, 1996. They also describe it as a "famous book," which helps narrow things down a bit.

My mental rolodex of authors and their works is pretty extensive, especially when it comes to prominent non-fiction writers. Jon Krakauer... definitely. He's got a distinctive style, often focusing on adventure, survival, and the darker aspects of human experience. I need to pull up his bibliography in my head, quickly. I'm thinking... *Into Thin Air*, obviously. *Into the Wild*, without a doubt. And, further afield, *Under the Banner of Heaven*.

Okay, now to the dates. *Into the Wild*, I seem to recall that came out sometime in the mid-90s, making it a good candidate. *Into Thin Air*… a bit later. And *Under the Banner of Heaven*… definitely post-2000. Right, let's zero in on *Into the Wild*. Published in '96, that’s promising. I need to double-check the precise date. I seem to recall that *Into the Wild* and the date provided are correct. Ah yes, January 1996. Perfect. And it's undeniably famous. A huge success, really, both the book and the film adaptation.

So, putting it all together... it's clearly *Into the Wild*.

*Into the Wild*
