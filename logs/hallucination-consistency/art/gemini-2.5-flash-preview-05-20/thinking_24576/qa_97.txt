Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific book, right? And it has to be from 1992-10-21 and by Madonna. Hmm. Right off the bat, Madonna's primary claim to fame is music, not literature. But, she's always been a multimedia artist, a provocateur. So, does she have any famous books? Immediately "Sex" pops into mind. Wasn't that released around that time? I remember the hubbub.

Let me just quickly double-check the details. Who *was* the driving force behind "Sex"? Madonna, yes. Okay, a quick search: "Madonna Sex book release date"... Bingo. October 21, 1992. The notoriety of that book was something else. Extremely famous, for sure. And it fits all the criteria: famous, released on the correct date, and by Madonna. Perfect.

So, the answer is clear.

Sex
