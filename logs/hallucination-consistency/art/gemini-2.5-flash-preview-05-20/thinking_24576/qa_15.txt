Okay, let's see... the prompt is asking for a specific book title, and the parameters are Robert Kiyosaki, a release date around April 1, 2000, and the descriptor "famous book."

First things first, Kiyosaki. Hmm, my immediate thought is, of course, *Rich Dad Poor Dad*. But, wait... that was definitely out well before the year 2000. So, *Rich Dad Poor Dad* is out.

The date is the key here. April 1st, 2000. Right. I need to narrow down the search to Kiyosaki books released around that time. Let me quickly scan my mental database... or I could do a quick search: "Robert Kiyosaki books released 2000" should do the trick. Or maybe "Robert Kiyosaki 2000 book."

Ah, yes! I recall, *Rich Dad's Guide to Investing*. Now, let me just quickly double-check the publication date for that one. Ah, yes, published in April of 2000 â€“ perfect! I know Amazon lists the paperback as being published on April 1, 2000, so that's the exact date we're looking for.

And is it considered *famous*? While maybe not *quite* at the level of *Rich Dad Poor Dad*, it's a very well-known and successful book within the "Rich Dad" series, and it's certainly one of Kiyosaki's most prominent works. It definitely meets the "famous book" criteria in the context of his overall output.

So, the answer is:

*Rich Dad's Guide to Investing*
