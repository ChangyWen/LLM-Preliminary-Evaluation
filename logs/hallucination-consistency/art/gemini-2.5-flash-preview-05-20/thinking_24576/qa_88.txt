Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific book, and they've given me the critical clues: the release date and the creator. Right, so the release date is November 2nd, 2010, and the author is Lynn Vincent. Got it.

The simplest way to find this is to craft a precise search query. I'd probably go with "Lynn Vincent book 2010-11-02," or perhaps even "Lynn Vincent book released November 2 2010." Either one should get us there quickly.

Now, let's mentally run that query. Hmm, I'm thinking... *Heaven Is for Real* is probably the answer, based on what I know about Vincent's work and that timeframe. Let me just double-check the details in my mental database. Yes, it was indeed released on November 2nd, 2010, and I recall it's a very well-known book. Also, I need to be sure about Lynn Vincent's involvement. Ah, yes, she was the co-author, in essence the ghostwriter, with Todd Burpo. The prompt mentioned "created by," which is a bit loose, but accurate given her role. So, it fits.

Alright, I've got the answer. Now, to provide the final, clear response.

*Heaven Is for Real: A Little Boy's Astounding Story of His Trip to Heaven and Back*
