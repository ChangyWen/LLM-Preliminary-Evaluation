I’ll start with something direct, like "Michael Crichton book May 12 1969". Just to be thorough, I might also try variations – maybe "Michael Crichton 1969 book release date," just in case. 

Now, time to execute the search, either mentally, using my recall, or quickly online. Aha! Yes, immediately a flash of recognition. I recall *The Andromeda Strain* was published around that time. Let’s verify, confirming my initial thought process. Michael Crichton? Check. May 12, 1969? Seems right. And the book itself? Undoubtedly, it fits. It's one of Crichton’s early, influential works, a classic in its genre. I'm quite familiar with this book, and remember its impact. Now, I just need to present the answer concisely.
