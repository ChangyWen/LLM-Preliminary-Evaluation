Okay, let's see. The user wants a book, a *famous* book by Roald Dahl, and they've given me a specific release date – January 17th, 1964. Right, so I need to work through my mental Rolodex of Dahl's works. Let's think… I know *James and the Giant Peach* came earlier, so that's out. Ah, *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*... 1964 rings a bell, and the date is specific, so it's likely to be right. Hmm, I should verify that date, though, just to be sure. *The Magic Finger* and *Fantastic Mr. Fox* came later, as did everything else on my mental list. No need to go through all the dates; the process of elimination is clear. Yes, the publication date checks out, particularly in the US. Excellent. Now for the answer...

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
