Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous book. Right, got it. Based on the instructions, I need to methodically work this out. The key data points provided are the release date, April 13, 1953, and the author, Ian Fleming. Hmmm... Ian Fleming... That immediately clicks â€“ James Bond. Now, what was the *first* James Bond book? I'm fairly certain it was *Casino Royale*. But let's just be absolutely sure, because the date is critical here. Gotta verify that publication date. I'll quickly look up "Casino Royale release date" or maybe "Ian Fleming first book release date" just to be absolutely, 100% certain. Ah, yes! *Casino Royale*, published April 13th, 1953. Perfect match. And as the foundational work of the Bond mythos, *Casino Royale* is undoubtedly a famous book. It's spawned a global franchise! Therefore, the answer is *Casino Royale*.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Casino Royale
