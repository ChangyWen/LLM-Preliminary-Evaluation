Okay, let's break this down. The user needs the name of a famous book. I'm immediately zeroing in on the clues: author and release date. Christopher Paolini...right, that's the "Inheritance Cycle" guy. And the date is August 26th, 2003. I know the first book was a huge hit, so the date sticks in my mind. The only book by him I remember reading with any particular acclaim, and that aligns with the given date, is... *Eragon*. Yeah, that was it. Let me just double-check in my head. Yep, *Eragon*, 2003... that feels right.

*Eragon*
