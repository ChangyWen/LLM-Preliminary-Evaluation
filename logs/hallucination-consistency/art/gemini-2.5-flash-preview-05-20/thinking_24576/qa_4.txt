Okay, here we go. Someone wants me to find a book by Jenny Han released on a specific date: April 15th, 2014. Right, let's think.

First, I'll mentally formulate the perfect search terms. Something like "Jenny Han book 2014-04-15 release date" or maybe just "Jenny Han 2014 book" to keep it simple.

Now, I'll either mentally execute the search, or, if I have to, actually perform one. My brain's pretty good at this, so likely a quick memory scan will do the trick. *Click!* Aha! "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" by Jenny Han.

Right, next, the verification phase. Jenny Han, check. April 15th, 2014, check. Everything lines up.

Excellent. Now to formulate the answer, precisely and clearly.

And, finally, a last sanity check to make sure everything is formatted correctly.

Here is the answer:
To All the Boys I've Loved Before
