Okay, here's what's going through my head: The user wants a specific book. They've given me the essentials: author, date, and some kind of descriptor, in this case, "famous book". Right. Let's see... Philip Pullman, release date October 10, 2000... "Famous book." Immediately, "His Dark Materials" springs to mind. Okay, the trilogy... I know the books off the top of my head: *Northern Lights* (or *The Golden Compass* for those in the US, that always trips people up), *The Subtle Knife*, and *The Amber Spyglass*. I need to compare those publication dates to what the user wants. 

*Northern Lights*... that was the early nineties. Nope. *The Subtle Knife*… mid-nineties? Nope. *The Amber Spyglass*… bingo! That one was released around the turn of the millennium. I believe it was October 10, 2000. I should really double-check my memory on that date, but, in my head, I'm pretty sure that's correct. And, of course, *The Amber Spyglass* *is* the final book in a hugely successful and critically acclaimed series. The "famous" descriptor certainly fits. I think I'm ready to give them the answer: *The Amber Spyglass*. I need to make sure the information is correct before I submit. Alright, final check - author is correct, release date is a match, and it's definitely a famous book. Done.
