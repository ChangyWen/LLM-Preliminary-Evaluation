Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous book, and they've provided some key details. Right, so we've got a release date of September 1st, 1979, and the author is Michael Ende. That's the starting point.

First thing, I need to identify what's relevant. Author and year, specifically 1979. "Famous book" is a broad stroke, but suggests I should be thinking of his most recognizable works from that timeframe.

Next, I need to pull some information. Right, Ende... my mental search should start with "Michael Ende book 1979," or maybe, "Michael Ende famous books". Then, I can filter by date.

Okay, Ende wrote some fantastic books, but two immediately jump to mind: *Momo* and *The Neverending Story*. Now, *Momo* came out earlier, wasn't it? Ah, yes, 1973. So, that's not it. *The Neverending Story*... Yes! That came out in 1979, didn't it? Let me just confirm that exact date... and, yes, the original was *Die unendliche Geschichte*, published in 1979.

And fame... *The Neverending Story* *is* definitely his most famous, especially considering the film adaptation. It really resonated internationally.

So, the answer is clear.

*The Neverending Story*
