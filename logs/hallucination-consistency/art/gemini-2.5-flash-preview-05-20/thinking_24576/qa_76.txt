Okay, let me think about this. First, the user wants a book, specified by a date, author, and implied prominence. Right. Immediately, the name "Steven Levitt" pops up â€“ that's a clear signal to me. My mind jumps to "Freakonomics." Now, to be absolutely sure, I need to check the release date: 2005-04-12. Yep, a quick mental scan, practically instantaneous, says that date checks out. And, of course, "Freakonomics" *is* extremely well-known and impactful. It fits the bill perfectly. So, I'll just state the answer.

Freakonomics
