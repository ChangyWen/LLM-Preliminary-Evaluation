Okay, here's what's going through my mind: Someone's asking for the name of a well-known book. They've given me the release date, the author's name, and implied popularity â€“ all key pieces of data. First, I need to analyze the prompt; what am I being asked? It's pretty straightforward: identify a specific book. I need to combine the clues into a solution.

Instantly, Suzanne Collins rings a bell. That points directly to *The Hunger Games*. But, the date, May 19, 2020, is very specific. That's not the release date of the original trilogy. This is almost certainly a *new* work by Collins, a recent one.

Now, I need to narrow down the possibilities. I'll either mentally or actually search something like "Suzanne Collins book released 2020" or "Suzanne Collins 2020-05-19."

The answer should pop right up. I know that book. And then I'll cross-reference my results. Does the book match the author's name? Check. Does the release date of the book match the date? Yes. Is it popular and well-known, as the request implied? Absolutely.

Finally, I'll give the answer:

*The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes*
