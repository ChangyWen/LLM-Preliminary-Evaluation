Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous book. Right, so the key information here is the author, Kurt Vonnegut, and the release date, March 31st, 1969. Got it.

Now, let's pull up Vonnegut in the mental library… publication dates, titles… Okay, sifting through the catalog of Vonnegut's works. Looking for something specifically around 1969… Ah, there it is, the big one. *Slaughterhouse-Five*. That's definitely the most famous, and if memory serves, the timing's right.

Just a quick mental double-check on the release date. March 31st… Yep, checks out. *Slaughterhouse-Five* it is. Time to deliver the goods.

*Slaughterhouse-Five*
