Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific book, and they've given me some good leads. Author: Hilary Mantel. Right away, my brain jumps to the *Wolf Hall* trilogy. Now, they mentioned a release date – April 30, 2009. Okay, I need to confirm if that matches up with my memory of the first book's publication. Yes, I seem to recall *Wolf Hall* coming out around that time, but I should be sure. Let me just… *click, whir*… Yep. April 30, 2009. And, of course, *Wolf Hall* is a hugely significant book. Booker Prize winner, widely acclaimed… fits the description perfectly. So, I think I have it all figured out.

Wolf Hall
