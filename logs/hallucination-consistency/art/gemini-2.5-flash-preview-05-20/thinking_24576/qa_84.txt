Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a specific book by Asimov, published on a particular date in 1950. Alright, straightforward request. First, I need to extract the core elements: Asimov, the date (December 2, 1950), and the fact that they're looking for a book. I know Asimov wrote *tons* of stuff, especially in the early 50s. I need to narrow this down. Let's see... I know *Foundation* was earlier, *I, Robot* was around that time, and *Pebble in the Sky* as well. Hmm, that specific date is a bit tricky; a precise date narrows it down a lot. Either I've got it memorized or I need a quick check. Let me see... I'll either search "Isaac Asimov book released 1950 December 2" or rely on my memory. *I, Robot*â€¦ was *I, Robot* released in 1950? I think so. It was a pivotal collection. Yes, that was around the right time. I'll check... A quick search will give me the exact release date. Ah, yes! December 2, 1950. *I, Robot* is certainly one of his more famous works, extremely influential. Okay, I have my answer. Now to state it clearly on a new line, as instructed.

I, Robot
