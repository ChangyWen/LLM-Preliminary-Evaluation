Okay, here's what's going through my head as I tackle this. Someone wants a book title. Alright, let's break this down. They’ve given me the release date: June 8th, 1999, and the author: Thomas Harris. Simple enough.

Thomas Harris... immediately, the Hannibal Lecter series comes to mind. *Red Dragon*, *Silence of the Lambs*, *Hannibal*, and *Hannibal Rising*. Now, I need to connect the dots between Harris, the date, and the specific book. I'll run through the titles and their known publication dates. *Red Dragon* was much earlier, *Silence of the Lambs* too. *Hannibal* feels like it's the right one. And *Hannibal Rising* is definitely after 1999.

To be absolutely sure, I’ll quickly confirm the *Hannibal* release date. No need to overthink it. A quick mental check, or if necessary a rapid search, should do the trick. Okay, yup, *Hannibal* indeed came out in 1999. That's the one.

So, now I just have to give them the title. Remembering the instructions: "final answer in a new line at the end of your response." Got it.

Hannibal
