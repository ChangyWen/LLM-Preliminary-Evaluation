*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's break this down. The user wants a specific book, and they've given me enough clues to nail it. First things first: I'm looking for a Michael Lewis book, released on June 17th, 2003, and described as "famous." Right away, my mental Rolodex kicks in. Michael Lewis... *Liar's Poker, The New New Thing, Moneyball, The Big Short, Flash Boys, The Blind Side* – the usual suspects. I'm thinking finance, economics, maybe sports.

Next step: let's check the dates. *Liar's Poker* and *The New New Thing* are way too early. Ah, *Moneyball*… that feels like it’s in the right ballpark. I've got a pretty strong feeling that's the one, but let's just double-check the date, just to be sure. Yes, June 17th, 2003! Excellent.

And then, "famous." *Moneyball* is undeniably famous. It's a cultural touchstone, especially with the movie adaptation. *The Big Short* and *Flash Boys* are also famous, but *Moneyball* fits the timeline perfectly. 

Perfect. The answer is clear. 

Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game
