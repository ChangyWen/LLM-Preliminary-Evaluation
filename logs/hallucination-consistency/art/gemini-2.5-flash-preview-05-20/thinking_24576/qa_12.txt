Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to identify a famous book, giving me the publication date and the author. I need to identify the title.

My expertise lies in knowing famous books, authors and release dates. I know Khaled Hosseini is the author. My brain is already sifting through my mental catalog. The first book that pops into my mind, because it's his most famous and also his debut, is *The Kite Runner*. Now, the critical bit – let's just quickly double-check the publication date to make certain. Ah, yes, that's perfect, matching the provided date. The author and release date are spot on, and of course it's famous – a huge best seller!

*The Kite Runner*
