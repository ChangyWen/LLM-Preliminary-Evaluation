Okay, let's break this down. The user's asking for a specific book, and it's got a few crucial identifiers: the release date, the author, and the implication that it's well-known. Hmm, Stephen Dubner... that name immediately sparks a connection. Where have I heard that before? Ah yes, Dubner and Levitt. And the big collaboration there is, of course, *Freakonomics*. Now, let me just verify that quickly. "Freakonomics" and, let's see... ah, yes, April 12th, 2005. Perfect. That confirms both the author and the release date. And *Freakonomics*? Absolutely, a massive bestseller. Definitely fits the bill of a "famous book." Right, I'm satisfied.

Freakonomics
