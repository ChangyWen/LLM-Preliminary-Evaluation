Okay, let's see… the user wants a specific book, huh? Let me break this down. 1977, J.R.R. Tolkien, and "famous." Right, right. Let's pull up the usual suspects. *The Hobbit*? Nope, way too early. *Lord of the Rings* trilogy? Also a no-go. Wait… *The Silmarillion*! That rings a bell, post-*Lord of the Rings* stuff. Let's run a quick check against the criteria: J.R.R. Tolkien, definitely, even though it was published posthumously by Christopher. Release date… hmmm, 1977 sounds right for that one, especially a late-year release like September 15th. And fame? Oh, absolutely. *The Silmarillion* is foundational to the whole Tolkien mythos. Okay, I think we've got it. The answer is *The Silmarillion*. And it addresses the question in the requested format. Perfect.
