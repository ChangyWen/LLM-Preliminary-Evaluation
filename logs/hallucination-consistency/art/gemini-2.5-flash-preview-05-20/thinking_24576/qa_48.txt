Okay, let's see. The task is straightforward: identify a book by Dominick Dunne published on September 13, 2007. Right. First things first, I'll pull up what I already know about Dunne. He was a master of true crime and chronicling the elite, a real insider with a keen eye for the dark side of high society. Heâ€™s best known for works like "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles" and "A Season in Purgatory."

Now, I need to check his publication history, specifically around the requested date. I'll mentally access my knowledge base on Dunne, and cross-reference it with the given date. Wait a second... Dunne passed away in 2009, so it's highly unlikely he published a *new* book in 2007. I'm almost certain he was primarily writing earlier.

I remember "The Way We Lived Then" being released in 2006. So no, the date doesn't align with my recall of his bibliography.

So, here's the problem: the premise is flawed. There's no book matching the provided parameters. The request is for "the name of the book," but the answer is there *isn't* a book. I can't just make something up.

I need to formulate a response that explains this clearly, while being polite and helpful. I'll state the facts, address the discrepancy, and be sure to emphasize the crucial fact: no book exists as described.

The final answer is straightforward: There is no famous book by Dominick Dunne released on September 13, 2007.
