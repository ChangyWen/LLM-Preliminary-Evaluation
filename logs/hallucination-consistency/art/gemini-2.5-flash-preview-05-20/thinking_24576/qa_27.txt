Okay, here we go. Let's see... they want the name of a famous book. Right, and I have some clues: the release date, the author, and, of course, that it's considered important. Alright, author first... Richard Condon. Hmm, that instantly pulls up "The Manchurian Candidate" in my mind. Now, the crucial part: that date. April 27th, 1959? Yep, need to verify. *Mental check... check...* Alright, locked in. Date matches. "The Manchurian Candidate" *is* the book. And as for fame? Absolutely, a classic. The film adaptations alone cement its place in cultural history. So, I have my answer: "The Manchurian Candidate." Now, they specifically asked for the final answer on its own line. Got it.

The Manchurian Candidate
