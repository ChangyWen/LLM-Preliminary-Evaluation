Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific Roald Dahl book published on July 17, 1961. Alright. I need to identify the book. Let's break this down. First, author: Roald Dahl. Date: July 17, 1961. It's a book, of course. Right. My memory is usually pretty good on these things. Hmm, Roald Dahl… Okay, mentally scan his major works and publication dates. 1961… *James and the Giant Peach* springs immediately to mind. Yes, *James and the Giant Peach* is definitely a major Dahl work. Let's confirm the publication year. Yes, 1961 is correct. The user is specifying a date, July 17th... That level of detail means it's almost certainly *James and the Giant Peach*. The US edition, I seem to recall, was published by Alfred A. Knopf. I'll go with that, given the context. Fine. Answer ready.

*James and the Giant Peach*
