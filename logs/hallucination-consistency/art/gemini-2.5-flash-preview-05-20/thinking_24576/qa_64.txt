Okay, let's break this down. The user wants a specific book and has provided some key information. It looks like they're looking for a book by William Steig that was released on October 17, 1990. Right, that's the central challenge.

First, I need to recall what I know about William Steig. He's a prominent figure in children's literature, of course. I know him. *Sylvester and the Magic Pebble*, *Doctor De Soto*, *Brave Irene*… I could rattle off several of his well-known works. And of course, there's *Shrek!* – that's the one that really blew up, given its adaptation into the massively successful film franchise.

Now, the date… October 17th, 1990. That's what I really need to zero in on. My immediate strategy would be to quickly search my mental database. I'd start by checking for a title by Steig released around that time. Something like "William Steig books 1990." Or, since *Shrek!* is so iconic, I might even query the release date for that one specifically. "William Steig Shrek release date" is a reasonable search term.

Okay, let me quickly check – and, yes, a quick search confirms that *Shrek!* by William Steig was, in fact, published in 1990. Ah, and the date confirms it. October 17, 1990. Perfect!

Let's confirm all the requirements. Author? William Steig. Date? October 17, 1990. Is it a famous book? Without a doubt. Considering the success of the film adaptations, *Shrek!* is certainly a well-known title.

Right, now I have it.

Shrek!
