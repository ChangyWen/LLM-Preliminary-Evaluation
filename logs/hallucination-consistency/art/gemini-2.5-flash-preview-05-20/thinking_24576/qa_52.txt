Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking for the title of a famous book, I get that. They've given me a release date, May 19, 1988, and the author, Thomas Harris. Right, so I need to dig through my mental library. Time to sift through what I know about Harris. Let's see… he wrote *Red Dragon*, *The Silence of the Lambs*, *Hannibal*, *Hannibal Rising*, and *Black Sunday*, though that last one might be a bit further afield from his usual style.

Now, the date is crucial. I need to cross-reference those titles with the 1988 release date. *Red Dragon*? Nope, that was much earlier. *Hannibal*? Too late. *Hannibal Rising*? Definitely not. *Black Sunday*? That's even older. That leaves me with… *The Silence of the Lambs*.

I need to be absolutely sure on this. A quick check confirms that *The Silence of the Lambs* *was* released on May 19, 1988. Perfect. Okay, the answer is clear. I’ll provide the book's title, formatted as requested. And, most importantly, I'll double-check that the answer is accurate, that it actually *is* what the user asked for, and that the formatting requirements are met. Alright, here we go...

The Silence of the Lambs
