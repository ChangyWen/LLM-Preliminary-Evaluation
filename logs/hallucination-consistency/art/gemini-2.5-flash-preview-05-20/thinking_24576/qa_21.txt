Okay, here's what's going through my head. The user wants a famous book. They've given me a date, an author, and the implicit assumption that this book is a big deal. Right off the bat, I know John Steinbeck. My brain automatically runs through his hits â€“ *The Grapes of Wrath*, *Of Mice and Men*, *East of Eden*, *The Pearl*, *Cannery Row*, *Travels with Charley*... that kind of thing. Now, I need to narrow it down with the date. 1952... let's see. *Grapes of Wrath* and *Of Mice and Men* are way earlier. Ah, *East of Eden*... I have a feeling. Gotta double-check the date. Yep, September 19, 1952. Perfect match! Steinbeck, check. Date, check. And *East of Eden* is *definitely* famous. Okay, let's make it clean. It's *East of Eden*. That's the answer.

East of Eden
