Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The task is crystal clear: find an Agatha Christie book, published on November 6th, 1961. First, I'll formulate my approach. This requires tapping into my expertise â€“ the knowledge base of Agatha Christie's publications, particularly focusing on their release dates.

I'll start by mentally formulating a search. Something like, "Agatha Christie book November 6 1961", or perhaps a broader approach: "Agatha Christie 1961 novels". Then, I will execute that query.

Next, I will swiftly evaluate the search results, expecting to pinpoint the correct title quickly. My understanding of her work and publishing timeline will allow me to hone in on the accurate answer. I would wager the answer will be *The Pale Horse*, but I will confirm this.

And finally, I'll present the answer clearly and directly, as instructed.

*The Pale Horse*
