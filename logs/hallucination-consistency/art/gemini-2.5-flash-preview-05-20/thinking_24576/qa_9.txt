Okay, let's break this down. The user wants a specific book, and they've given me some clues. Jordan Peterson, a specific date, and it's supposed to be a "famous book." Right.

First, I need to recall what Peterson's big books are. I know he's got a few, but the most well-known are probably *Maps of Meaning*, *12 Rules for Life*, and *Beyond Order*. *Maps of Meaning* is older, definitely not 2018. *12 Rules for Life*... that one sticks in my mind as super popular, and it *feels* like it came out around that time. *Beyond Order* is more recent, I'm pretty sure.

Time to double-check those dates. I'll mentally scan for them. Okay, *12 Rules* is the key. Let's see... yep, the English edition of *12 Rules for Life* came out January 16, 2018. Perfect. The user said 2018-01-16, so the date is locked in. And *12 Rules* *was* a huge international bestseller, so "famous" is definitely a good fit.

Alright, I'm confident.

12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos
