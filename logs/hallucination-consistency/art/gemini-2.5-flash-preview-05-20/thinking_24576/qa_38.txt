Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous book, and I'm apparently in charge of figuring it out. Alright, let's break this down. The critical pieces of information are the author, Khaled Hosseini, and the release date, May 22nd, 2007. My brain is already sifting through my mental catalog of significant literary works and authors.

I know Hosseini, of course. *The Kite Runner* is the obvious one, but I distinctly remember *A Thousand Splendid Suns* as another of his major works. I seem to recall that one being released around that time period. Let me just quickly confirm the release date of *A Thousand Splendid Suns* â€“ either a quick mental check or a digital search should do it. Ah yes, May 2007. And bingo, the specific date, May 22nd, 2007, is what we're looking for! It all fits.

Therefore, the answer is clear.

A Thousand Splendid Suns
