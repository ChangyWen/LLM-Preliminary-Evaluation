Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the name of a well-known book, which implies a fairly popular title, and they've given me some crucial clues: the author and the release date. The author is Philip Pullman, and the date is 1997-07-22. Right away, my mind jumps to "His Dark Materials." Pullman's *His Dark Materials* trilogy is his most iconic work, a landmark of modern fantasy, and I should start there. Now, I need to mentally run through the publication dates. I know *Northern Lights* came out in '95. *The Subtle Knife* was released in 1997. *The Amber Spyglass* in 2000. Bingo! The year matches up perfectly. Now, I just need to confirm the exact date for *The Subtle Knife* and that it was indeed published in July of that year. Yes, that's correct. *The Subtle Knife* absolutely fits the bill: It's famous, it's a Pullman book, and it came out on the correct date. Therefore, the answer is clear.

*The Subtle Knife*
