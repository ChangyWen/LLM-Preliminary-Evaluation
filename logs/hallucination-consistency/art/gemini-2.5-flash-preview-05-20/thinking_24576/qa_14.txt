Okay, let's see. The user needs a book title, specific information, and a formatted output. Easy enough. First, I need to process the request: Jenny Han, release date May 2nd, 2017. Got it.

Right, Jenny Han. That triggers the "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" series instantly. I know there's more than one book. Also, "The Summer I Turned Pretty" pops into mind. But the date, May 2nd, 2017, is the key here.

Let's think about this strategically. I'm going to focus on the "To All the Boys..." series. I know the first book came out earlier, so let me see, "To All the Boys I've Loved Before," was, maybe 2014? "P.S. I Still Love You" was around then too, so a few years on. Then the final book in the series, "Always and Forever, Lara Jean," That *feels* right for 2017. It's the end of a series, it makes sense. And the date... that checks out.

Okay, I'm pretty confident, but let me just double-check. Yeah, that's it.

Always and Forever, Lara Jean
