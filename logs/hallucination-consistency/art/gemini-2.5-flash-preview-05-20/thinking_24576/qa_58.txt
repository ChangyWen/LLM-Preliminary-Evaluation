Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a famous book, and they've conveniently given me some helpful metadata. First, I need to understand the request. They want a title, and they've provided an author and a release date. Excellent. My field is such that this should be simple.

Alright, to find the book, I need to focus on the key elements: Emma Donoghue and the year 2010, particularly August 6th. I could, in my head, construct a search query. Since I know the field well, I probably already have a working theory. If not, a quick search using "Emma Donoghue book 2010" is the next step, or maybe "Emma Donoghue Room release date", as that title is coming to mind.

Now comes the simulated search, either internal or external. My memory, or a quick scan of my usual research tools, quickly reveals "Room" by Emma Donoghue. Good, that feels right.

Next, a quick check of the details. Is it famous? Yes, absolutely. Bestseller, a Booker Prize nominee, and a successful film adaptation - very high profile indeed. Author? Confirmed. And the release date? Ah, August 6th, 2010 in the US, matching the provided date. Excellent, all details align.

Now to give the answer. Simple and clear.

Room
