Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the book released on April 15, 2014, by Jenny Han. Let me start by recalling what I know about Jenny Han. She's an author known for young adult fiction, especially the "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" series. The first book in that series was published in 2014. Wait, let me check the dates. The first book in the series is "To All the Boys I've Loved Before," which I think came out in 2014. The release date might be around April. Let me confirm the exact date. I remember that the book was released in April 2014, and the 15th might be the specific date. Since the user is asking for the book created by Jenny Han on that exact date, it's likely the first book in the series. The series is quite popular, so that's probably the answer. I don't think she released another book on that date. Let me double-check. A quick search in my mind: Jenny Han's works include "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" (2014), "Always and Forever, Lara Jean" (2017), and "PS, I Still Love You" (2016). The first one is definitely from 2014. The exact release date being April 15th makes sense because the book's title is often associated with that time. So the answer should be "To All the Boys I've Loved Before."
