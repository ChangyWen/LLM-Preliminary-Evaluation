Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on May 29, 2003, by Khaled Hosseini. Let me start by recalling what I know about Khaled Hosseini. He's an Afghan-American author, right? His first novel is pretty well-known. I think it's called "The Kite Runner." Wait, when was that published? Let me check my memory. I believe "The Kite Runner" was published in 2003. But the exact date? The user specified May 29. Let me confirm.

I remember that "The Kite Runner" was his debut novel and it became a bestseller. The publication date... I think it was in the spring of 2003. May 29th might be the exact date. Let me see if there's any conflicting information. Another book by him is "A Thousand Splendid Suns," but that came out later, in 2007. So the 2003 one is definitely "The Kite Runner." The date matches up with what I've read before. So the answer should be "The Kite Runner."
