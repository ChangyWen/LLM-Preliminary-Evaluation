Okay, so the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 1, 1979, created by Michael Ende. Let me think. Michael Ende is a well-known author, and I remember he wrote a very popular book. The most famous one that comes to mind is "The Neverending Story." Let me check the publication date. I think "The Neverending Story" was indeed published in 1979. The exact date might be September 1st. I should confirm that. A quick search in my memory: yes, the original German version was published in 1979, and the English translation followed in 1983. The user specified the release date as 1979-09-01, which matches the original publication date. So the answer should be "The Neverending Story."
