Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on October 10, 1961, created by Joseph Heller. Let me start by recalling what I know about Joseph Heller. He's an American author, right? I think he's best known for a novel that's a classic in American literature. The title might be something like "Catch-22." Wait, yes, that sounds familiar. "Catch-22" is a satirical novel about the absurdities of war, specifically set during World War II. The main character is Yossarian, if I remember correctly.

Now, checking the publication date. I need to confirm if "Catch-22" was indeed published on October 10, 1961. I know that the book was first published in 1961, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact date. Let me think. I recall that some sources mention the publication date as October 10, 1961. That seems right. Joseph Heller wrote it while working as an insurance actuary, which is kind of an interesting fact. The novel was a critical and commercial success, and it's considered one of the greatest works of the 20th century. The term "Catch-22" has even entered common usage to describe a paradoxical situation. 

I don't think Heller wrote any other books that are as famous as "Catch-22." He did write other novels like "Good as Gold" and "Something Happened," but those aren't as well-known. So, putting it all together, the answer should be "Catch-22." Let me just double-check the publication date again. A quick search in my memory: yes, October 10, 1961, is the correct date for the first publication of "Catch-22" by Joseph Heller. I think that's solid. No other books by him come to mind with that date. So I'm confident the answer is "Catch-22."
