Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on February 14, 2017, by George Saunders. Let me start by recalling what I know about George Saunders. He's an American writer known for his short stories and novels. Some of his well-known works include "Lincoln in the Bardo," which I think won the Man Booker Prize. Wait, when was that book published? I believe "Lincoln in the Bardo" came out in 2017. Let me check the dates. If the user is asking for a book released on February 14, 2017, that's a specific date. I should verify if "Lincoln in the Bardo" was indeed published on that date.

I remember that the Man Booker Prize for 2017 was awarded to that book, and the release date might align with that timeframe. Let me think. George Saunders is also known for his short story collections like "Pastoralia" and "Tenth of December." But the question specifies a book released in early 2017. Another possibility could be "The Tenth of December," but I think that was published earlier, maybe 2013. 

Wait, "Lincoln in the Bardo" was published in February 2017. Let me confirm the exact date. A quick search in my memory: yes, I think it was released on February 14, 2017. That's Valentine's Day, which is an interesting date for a book about Lincoln and death, but maybe that's just a coincidence. The book is a novel that blends historical facts with fictional elements, focusing on Lincoln's grief over his son's death. It's structured as a story told by ghosts in a bardo, which is a Tibetan concept of an intermediate state between death and rebirth. 

I don't recall any other major books by Saunders around that time. His other works are mostly short stories or earlier novels. So putting it all together, the answer is likely "Lincoln in the Bardo." The date matches, the author is correct, and it's a well-known book from that period. I think that's the one.
