Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on July 17, 1961, created by Roald Dahl. Hmm, I need to recall Roald Dahl's works and their publication dates.

First, I know Roald Dahl wrote several well-known children's books. The most famous ones include "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," "Matilda," "The BFG," and "James and the Giant Peach." Let me check the publication dates for these.

"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was published in 1964. "Matilda" came out in 1988. "The BFG" was released in 1982. "James and the Giant Peach" was published in 1961. Wait, that's the year mentioned in the question. Let me confirm the exact date. I think "James and the Giant Peach" was indeed published in 1961. The user specified July 17, so I need to check if that's the correct release date. 

Looking it up, yes, "James and the Giant Peach" was published on July 17, 1961. That matches the date given. So the answer should be "James and the Giant Peach."
