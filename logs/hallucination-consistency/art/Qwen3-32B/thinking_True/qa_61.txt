Okay, so the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on August 24, 2010, created by Suzanne Collins. Let me think. I know Suzanne Collins is the author of The Hunger Games series. The first book in that series was published in 2008, right? The second one, Catching Fire, came out in 2009. Then the third one, Mockingjay, was released in 2010. Wait, the date they mentioned is August 24, 2010. Let me check the release dates again.

The Hunger Games was 2008, Catching Fire 2009, and Mockingjay was indeed published on August 24, 2010. So that must be the one. The user is probably confirming the title and the date. They might be a fan of the series or studying it. I should make sure there's no other book by her around that time. I don't recall any other major releases by Suzanne Collins in 2010. So the answer should be Mockingjay.
