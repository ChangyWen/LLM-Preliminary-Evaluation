Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on October 10, 2013, created by Greg Sestero. Hmm, I need to recall if I know any books by that author with that release date.

First, I remember that Greg Sestero is an actor and writer. He was in "The Room," right? That movie is pretty infamous. Now, I think he wrote a book about his experiences with "The Room." The title might be something like "The Disaster Artist." Wait, wasn't that the book that later became a movie itself? Let me check the details. The book was published in 2013, and the movie adaptation came out in 2017. The author is Greg Sestero, and it's co-written with Tom Bissell. The release date... I think it was October 10, 2013. Yeah, that matches the date the user mentioned. So the book is "The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, The Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made." That should be the correct answer. Let me just confirm the date again. Yes, I believe the publication date is October 10, 2013. The user might be looking for that specific title. I don't think there are other notable books by Sestero from that time. So the answer should be "The Disaster Artist."
