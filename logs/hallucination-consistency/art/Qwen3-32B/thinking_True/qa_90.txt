Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on June 8, 1999, by Thomas Harris. Let me start by recalling Thomas Harris's works. He's known for writing psychological thrillers, right? His most famous books include "The Silence of the Lambs," which was published in 1988. Then there's "Red Dragon" from 1981, and "Hannibal" which came out in 1999. Wait, the user mentioned the date 1999-06-08. Let me check the publication dates.

I remember that "Hannibal" was the sequel to "The Silence of the Lambs." The first book was "Red Dragon," then "The Silence of the Lambs," and then "Hannibal." The publication date for "Hannibal" is indeed 1999. Let me confirm the exact date. I think "Hannibal" was published in June 1999. The exact date might be June 8th. I should verify this. A quick search in my memory: yes, "Hannibal" by Thomas Harris was released on June 8, 1999. That matches the date the user provided. So the answer should be "Hannibal."
