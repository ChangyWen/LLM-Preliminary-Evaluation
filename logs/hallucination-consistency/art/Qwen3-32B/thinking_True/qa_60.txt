Okay, so I need to figure out which famous book by Agatha Christie was released on November 6, 1961. Let me start by recalling some of her well-known works. She wrote a lot of detective novels, like "Murder on the Orient Express," "And Then There Were None," and "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd." But I'm not sure about the publication dates of these.

I remember that "And Then There Were None" was published in 1939, and "Murder on the Orient Express" came out in 1934. "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd" was 1926. So those are earlier. Maybe it's one of her later works. Let me think. She was active until the 1970s. 

Wait, in 1961, she might have written a book. Let me check some of her later titles. There's "The Clocks" from 1963, but that's after 1961. "Endless Night" was published in 1967. Hmm. Maybe "The Mirror Crack'd," which I think was published in 1962. But the user is asking for November 6, 1961. 

Wait, maybe "The Blue Geranium"? No, that's a play. Or "Hallowe'en Party," which was published in 1969. Not that one. Let me think again. Oh, wait! "The Murder at the Vicarage" was 1930. Not that one. 

Wait, maybe "The Sittaford Mystery"? No, that's 1931. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to recall if there's a book that's less known but published in 1961. Alternatively, perhaps it's a collection of short stories. Agatha Christie also wrote several short story collections. 

Wait, "The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding" is a play, not a book. Maybe "The Mysterious Mr. Quin" was published in 1930. Not helpful. 

Wait, perhaps "The Secret Adversary," but that's 1922. 

Wait, maybe "The Man in the Brown Suit," published in 1924. No. 

Wait, maybe "N or M?" from 1941. No. 

Wait, perhaps "The Hollow" from 1946. No. 

Wait, maybe "The Labors of Hercules," a collection of short stories, published in 1947. 

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me check if there's a book that was published in 1961. Let me think of her bibliography. 

Looking up in my mind, Agatha Christie's works in the 1960s: 

- 1960: "The Golden Ball"
- 1961: "The Clocks" (but that's 1963)
Wait, maybe "The Clocks" was actually published in 1963, so not 1961. 

Wait, perhaps "The Blue Geranium" was a play, but the book version? No. 

Wait, maybe "The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding" was published as a book in 1961? No, that's a play. 

Wait, maybe "The Mousetrap," but that's a play from 1952. 

Wait, perhaps "The Thirteen Problems," but that's 1932. 

Wait, maybe "The Pale Horse," which was published in 1961. Yes! I think "The Pale Horse" was published in 1961. Let me confirm the date. If it was released on November 6, 1961, that would fit. 

Yes, "The Pale Horse" is a novel by Agatha Christie, published in 1961. It's one of her later works, and it's known for its supernatural elements, which is a bit different from her usual mystery style. The plot involves a mysterious book and a series of deaths. So I think that's the one.
