Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on August 4, 2015, by N.K. Jemisin. Let me start by recalling what I know about N.K. Jemisin. She's a science fiction and fantasy author, right? I remember she's won multiple Hugo Awards. Her most well-known work is probably the Broken Earth trilogy. Let me think about the release dates of her books.

The first book in the Broken Earth trilogy is "The Fifth Season." I think that came out in 2015. Let me check the exact date. If I recall correctly, "The Fifth Season" was published in August 2015. The date August 4th might be the specific release date. I should verify if that's correct. I don't think she released any other major books around that time. The Broken Earth trilogy consists of three books: "The Fifth Season," "The Obelisk Gate," and "The Stone Sky." The first one was definitely 2015. So putting it all together, the answer should be "The Fifth Season" by N.K. Jemisin, released on August 4, 2015.
