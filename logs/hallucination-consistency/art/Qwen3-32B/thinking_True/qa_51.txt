Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on September 16, 1992, by Donna Tartt. Let me start by recalling what I know about Donna Tartt's works. She's an American author, and I think her most well-known book is "The Secret History." But wait, when was that published? Let me check my memory. I believe "The Secret History" was her debut novel. If I remember correctly, it was published in the early 1990s. The exact date might be around 1992. Let me confirm the date. I think the release date was September 16, 1992. That seems right. I don't think she published any other major books around that time. Her next book was "The Little Friend" in 2001, and then "The Goldfinch" in 2013. So yes, the 1992 book would be "The Secret History." The user is asking for the name of the book, so the answer should be that. I just need to make sure there's no other book by her with a similar release date. I don't recall any other titles from that period. Therefore, the answer is "The Secret History."
