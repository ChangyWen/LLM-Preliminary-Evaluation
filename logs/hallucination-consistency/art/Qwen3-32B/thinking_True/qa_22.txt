Okay, so the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 11, 2001, by Yann Martel. Let me think. I remember that Yann Martel wrote a well-known book that won the Man Booker Prize. The title might be something like "Life of Pi." Wait, when was that published? Let me check my memory. I think "Life of Pi" was published in 2001. But wait, the date they mentioned is September 11. I need to confirm the exact release date. Sometimes books are published in different regions on different dates. The Canadian release was in 2001, and maybe the U.S. release was around that time. September 11 is a significant date, but I don't recall if that's the exact day. However, the user is probably referring to "Life of Pi" since it's Martel's most famous work. Let me double-check. Yes, "Life of Pi" was published in Canada in 2001, and the U.S. edition came out in 2002. But maybe the initial release was in September 2001. Alternatively, could there be another book? I don't think so. Martel's other works aren't as famous. So the answer is likely "Life of Pi."
