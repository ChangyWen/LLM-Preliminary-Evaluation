Okay, so I need to figure out which famous book Michael Lewis wrote that was released on March 15, 2010. Let me start by recalling what I know about Michael Lewis. He's a well-known author who writes about finance, economics, and business. Some of his popular books include "The Big Short," "Liar's Poker," and "Moneyball." 

Now, the date is March 15, 2010. Let me think about the publication dates of his books. "The Big Short" was published in 2009, right? And "Moneyball" came out in 2003. "Liar's Poker" was 1989. Hmm, so maybe there's another one. Wait, he also wrote "The Blind Side" which was a bestseller and later made into a movie. But when was that published? I think "The Blind Side" was released in 2006. 

Wait, maybe it's "The Big Short" but I thought that was 2009. Let me check. No, "The Big Short" was published in 2009, so that's not it. What about "Boomerang: Travels in the New Europe"? That was 2010. Let me confirm the date. If I remember correctly, "Boomerang" was published in March 2010. The exact date might be March 15. 

Alternatively, maybe it's "The Undoing Project," but that was 2016. Another possibility is "The Fifth Risk," which is more recent, 2018. So, going back to 2010. "Boomerang" by Michael Lewis was indeed published in March 2010. Let me verify the exact date. A quick search in my mind (since I can't actually look it up) tells me that "Boomerang" was released on March 15, 2010. That fits the date given in the question. 

So the answer should be "Boomerang: Travels in the New Europe" by Michael Lewis, published on March 15, 2010.
