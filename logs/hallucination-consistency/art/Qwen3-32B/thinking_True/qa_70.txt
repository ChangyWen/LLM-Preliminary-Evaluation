Okay, so the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on August 17, 1996, created by Chuck Palahniuk. Let me think. Chuck Palahniuk is a well-known author, and one of his most famous works is "Fight Club." I remember that "Fight Club" was published in 1996. Let me check the exact date. The publication date for "Fight Club" is indeed August 17, 1996. That matches the date the user provided. I don't think he has any other major books from that time. "Fight Club" became really popular and was later adapted into a movie. So the answer should be "Fight Club."
