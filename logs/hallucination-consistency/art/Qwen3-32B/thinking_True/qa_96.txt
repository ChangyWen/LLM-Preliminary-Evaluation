Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on April 26, 2001, by Eoin Colfer. Let me start by recalling what I know about Eoin Colfer. He's an Irish author, right? I think he's well-known for a series of children's books. The most famous one that comes to mind is the Artemis Fowl series. Let me check the publication dates for that.

The first book in the Artemis Fowl series is "Artemis Fowl." I believe that was published in 2001. If I remember correctly, the release date was around April or May. The user specified April 26, 2001. Let me verify that. A quick search in my memory: yes, "Artemis Fowl" was indeed published on April 26, 2001. That matches the date given. Eoin Colfer is the author, and it's the first book in the series. It became quite popular and started a successful series. I don't think he has another major book that came out on that exact date. So the answer should be "Artemis Fowl."
