Okay, so I need to figure out which famous book by Michael Crichton was released on November 20, 1990. Let me start by recalling Michael Crichton's most well-known works. He's famous for "Jurassic Park," which I think was a huge success. But when was that published? I remember the movie came out in 1993, so the book might have been a couple of years before that. Let me check the dates.

Wait, the user is asking for a book released in 1990. "Jurassic Park" was published in 1990, right? Let me confirm. Yes, I think the book came out in 1990, and the movie followed in 1993. The exact date mentioned here is November 20, 1990. So if "Jurassic Park" was published in 1990, that might be the one. But I should make sure there aren't any other books by Crichton around that time. Let me think. He wrote "The Andromeda Strain" earlier, in 1969. Then there's "Congo," which was published in 1980. "Sphere" came out in 1987. "Timeline" was 1999. So between 1990 and 1999, "Jurassic Park" is the major one. 

Another way to verify: I can recall that "Jurassic Park" was a bestseller and became a cultural phenomenon. The release date of the book being in 1990 fits with the movie's release in 1993. So I'm pretty confident that the book in question is "Jurassic Park." Let me just double-check the exact publication date. A quick search in my memory: yes, "Jurassic Park" was published on April 29, 1990. Wait, the user said November 20, 1990. Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe there's a different edition or a different country's release date? Or perhaps I'm mixing up the dates. Alternatively, maybe it's another book. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe it's "The Lost World," which is a sequel to "Jurassic Park." When was that published? I think "The Lost World" came out in 1995. So that's not it. What about "Prey," but that's 2002. "State of Fear" is 2004. So maybe the user is mistaken about the date, or perhaps there's a different book. Alternatively, maybe the date given is the movie release date, but the question is about the book. The movie "Jurassic Park" was released in 1993, so the book was earlier. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the UK publication date? Sometimes books are released on different dates in different countries. Let me check. The original publication date for "Jurassic Park" in the US was April 1990. The UK edition was released in May 1990. So November 20, 1990, doesn't align with that. Maybe there's another book. Let me think of other Crichton works. "Disclosure" was 1994. "Airframe" 1996. "Timeline" 1999. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the user is confused between the book and the movie. The movie "Jurassic Park" was released in June 1993. The book was definitely 1990. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the date. But the question specifically says the book was released on November 20, 1990. Is there a possibility that another book by Crichton was published on that date? Let me think. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different format, like an audiobook or a special edition. But I don't recall any other major Crichton books from that time. Maybe the user is mistaken. But given that the question is asking for the famous book by Crichton in that date range, the most likely answer is "Jurassic Park," even if the exact date doesn't match. Perhaps the user got the date wrong, but the book is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a different book. 

Wait, another thought: Michael Crichton also wrote "The Great Train Robbery," which was published in 1975. No, that's earlier. "Eaters of the Dead" was 1999. Hmm. Maybe the user is referring to a different work. But given the information, the best answer is "Jurassic Park," even if the date is slightly off. The user might have confused the movie date with the book date. So I'll go with "Jurassic Park" as the answer.
