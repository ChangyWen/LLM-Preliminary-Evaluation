Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 19, 1952, created by John Steinbeck. Hmm, I need to recall Steinbeck's works and their publication dates.

First, I know John Steinbeck wrote "The Grapes of Wrath," which is a classic, but that was published in 1939. Then there's "East of Eden," which I think came out in 1952. Let me check the dates. "East of Eden" was indeed published in 1952. The exact date might be September 19th. Wait, I should confirm that. Some sources say it was released in September 1952, but the specific date might not be as commonly cited. However, the user specified September 19, so I need to be sure. 

Another possibility is "Cannery Row," but that was 1945. "Of Mice and Men" was 1937. "The Old Man and the Sea" is by Hemingway, so that's not it. "In Dubious Battle" was 1936. So the most likely candidate is "East of Eden." Let me double-check the publication date. A quick search in my memory: "East of Eden" by John Steinbeck was published on September 19, 1952. Yes, that's correct. It's his most ambitious work, and he considered it his magnum opus. The user is probably looking for that title. I think that's the answer.
