Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on February 19, 1963, by Betty Friedan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Betty Friedan. She was a prominent figure in the feminist movement, right? I think she wrote a book that's considered a foundational text in second-wave feminism. The title might be something like "The Feminine Mystique." Wait, wasn't that published in the 1960s? Let me check the date. The user mentioned 1963-02-19. I believe "The Feminine Mystique" was indeed published in 1963. Let me confirm the exact date. A quick search in my memory: yes, I think it was February 1963. Betty Friedan's book critiqued the idealized image of women as homemakers and sparked a lot of discussion about women's roles in society. That must be the one. I don't think she wrote any other books that are as famous. Maybe "The Feminine Mystique" is the correct answer here. Let me make sure there's no other book by her around that time. No, I think that's the only one. So the answer should be "The Feminine Mystique."
