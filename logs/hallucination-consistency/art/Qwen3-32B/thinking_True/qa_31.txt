Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on January 13, 1996, written by Jon Krakauer. Let me start by recalling what I know about Jon Krakauer. He's a well-known author and journalist, famous for writing non-fiction books, especially those related to adventure and mountaineering.

One of his most famous works is "Into the Wild," which I think was published later, maybe in the late 90s or early 2000s. But the date given here is 1996. Wait, there's another book he wrote about the Everest disaster. Oh right, "Into Thin Air." That's about the 1996 Mount Everest disaster where several climbers died. Let me check the publication date. I believe "Into Thin Air" was published in 1997. Hmm, but the user is asking for a book released in 1996. Maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe there's another book. Let me list some of his works. "Into the Wild" was 1996? No, I think that came out in 1996. Wait, no, "Into the Wild" was published in 1996. Wait, but the user is specifying the exact date of January 13, 1996. Let me confirm. "Into the Wild" was published in 1996, but I'm not sure of the exact date. However, "Into Thin Air" was published in 1997. So maybe the user is referring to "Into the Wild." But I need to be precise. Let me check my memory. Jon Krakauer's "Into the Wild" is about Christopher McCandless, who went into the Alaskan wilderness. The book was published in 1996. The exact date might be January 13. Alternatively, maybe it's another book. Let me think. Another book by him is "Under the Banner of Heaven," but that's more recent. So the most likely answer is "Into the Wild." But I need to be sure. Let me cross-verify. If the user says 1996-01-13, then "Into the Wild" was published in 1996. I think the publication date is correct. So the answer should be "Into the Wild."
