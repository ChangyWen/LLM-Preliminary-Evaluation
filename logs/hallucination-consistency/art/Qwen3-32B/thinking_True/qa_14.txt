Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the book released on May 2, 2017, by Jenny Han. Let me start by recalling what I know about Jenny Han. She's an author known for young adult fiction, especially the "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" series. The first book in that series came out in 2014, and there were sequels. Let me check the release dates.

The first book, "To All the Boys I've Loved Before," was 2014. The second one, "P.S. I Still Love You," was released in 2017. Wait, the user is asking for a book from May 2, 2017. That might be the second book in the series. Let me confirm the exact release date. I think "P.S. I Still Love You" was indeed published in 2017. The third book, "Always and Forever, Lara Jean," came out in 2017 as well, but maybe in a different month. Let me check the exact dates. 

Looking it up, "P.S. I Still Love You" was released on May 2, 2017. The third book was released in August 2017. So the answer should be "P.S. I Still Love You." That fits the date and the author. I don't think Jenny Han released any other major books around that time. The title is part of the popular To All the Boys series, which was later adapted into a Netflix movie. Yeah, that's the one.
