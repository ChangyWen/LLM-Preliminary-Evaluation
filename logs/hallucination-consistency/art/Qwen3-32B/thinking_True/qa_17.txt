Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on January 17, 1964, created by Roald Dahl. Hmm, I need to recall Roald Dahl's works and their publication dates.

First, I know Roald Dahl wrote several well-known children's books. The most famous ones include "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," "Matilda," "The BFG," and "James and the Giant Peach." Let me check the publication dates for these.

"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was published in 1964. Wait, the exact date? I think it was released in the UK in September 1964. But the user mentioned January 17, 1964. That's earlier. Maybe another book?

Wait, "James and the Giant Peach" was published in 1961. "The BFG" came out in 1982. "Matilda" was 1988. So "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is the one from 1964. But the exact date? Let me verify. Some sources say it was published on September 12, 1964, in the UK. The user's date is January 17, 1964. That's a few months earlier. Could there be another book?

Wait, maybe the user is referring to the US publication date? Sometimes books are released in different countries at different times. Let me check. The US edition of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was published on October 2, 1964. Still not January 17. Hmm.

Is there another book by Roald Dahl from 1964? Let me think. "The Witches" was published in 1983. "Fantastic Mr. Fox" in 1970. "The Twits" in 1980. So maybe the user's date is incorrect, or perhaps it's a different edition or a different country's release. Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken about the date. But given that the user is asking for the book released on that specific date, perhaps the answer is "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," even if the exact date isn't January 17. Maybe the user has a different source or it's a common misconception. Alternatively, maybe there's another book. Wait, "The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me" was published in 1981. No. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the original title in another language. "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was originally titled "Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator" in the UK, but that's the same book. The publication date might be different in different regions. If the user is citing a specific date, perhaps it's a special edition or a different country's release. But the most famous book by Roald Dahl from 1964 is definitely "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." So I think that's the answer they're looking for, even if the exact date might not match. Maybe the user's information is slightly off. So I'll go with that.
