Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on September 5, 1996, by Frank McCourt. Let me start by recalling what I know about Frank McCourt. He's an Irish-American author, right? I remember he wrote a memoir that became really popular. The title might be something like "Angela's..." Wait, Angela's Ashes? Yes, that sounds familiar. Let me check the details. Angela's Ashes is a memoir about his childhood in Ireland. When was that book published? I think it was in the late 90s. Let me confirm the date. If the user says September 5, 1996, that's the release date. I should verify if Angela's Ashes was indeed published on that date. I might be mixing it up with another book, but I'm pretty sure Angela's Ashes is the one. Another possibility is that he wrote other books, like "Tis" which is a sequel, but that came out later, in 1999. So the 1996 book would be Angela's Ashes. Let me make sure there's no other book by him from that time. A quick search in my memory: Frank McCourt's most famous work is definitely Angela's Ashes. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography in 1997, which would align with a 1996 publication date. So yes, the answer should be Angela's Ashes.
