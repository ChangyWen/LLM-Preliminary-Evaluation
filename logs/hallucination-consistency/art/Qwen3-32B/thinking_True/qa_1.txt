Okay, so I need to figure out which famous book by Stephen King was released on September 15, 1986. Let me start by recalling some of his well-known works and their publication dates.

First, Stephen King has written a lot of books, so I need to narrow it down. The date given is 1986. Let me think about his books from the mid-80s. "The Stand" was published in 1978, so that's too early. "Salem's Lot" was 1975. "The Shining" came out in 1977. Then there's "It," which I think was published in 1986. Wait, was that the release date? Let me check my memory. "It" is a thick book, split into two parts, and it's one of his most famous works. I believe the publication date for "It" was September 15, 1986. 

Another possibility might be "The Dark Tower" series, but the first book in that series, "The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger," was published in 1982. So that's not it. "Misery" was 1987, so that's after 1986. "The Green Mile" was part of "The Green Mile" collection, which was 1996. 

Wait, maybe "The Eyes of the Dragon"? No, that was 1984. "Pet Sematary" was 1983. So going back, "It" seems to fit the 1986 date. Let me confirm. I think "It" was indeed released in September 1986. The exact date might be September 15th. I can't think of any other major Stephen King book from that time. So the answer is probably "It."
