Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on June 27, 2006, by Scott Lynch. Let me start by recalling what I know about Scott Lynch. He's a fantasy author, right? I think he's known for a series that's quite popular. The first book in his series... Hmm, I remember the title might be something like "The Lies of Locke Lamora." Wait, is that the one? Let me check the dates. If I recall correctly, "The Lies of Locke Lamora" was his debut novel. When was that published? I think it was around 2006. Let me confirm the exact date. June 27, 2006... Yes, that sounds familiar. I think that's the release date. The book is part of the Gentleman Bastard series. So, the answer should be "The Lies of Locke Lamora." I don't think there are any other books by Scott Lynch from that time. Another author might have a similar name, but Scott Lynch's first book is definitely that one. I think that's correct.
