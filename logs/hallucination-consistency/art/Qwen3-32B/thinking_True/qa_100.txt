Okay, so the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on November 9, 1984, created by Douglas Adams. Let me think. Douglas Adams is best known for "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," which was a series. The first book in that series was published in 1979. But the user is asking about a book from 1984. Wait, maybe it's one of the later books in the series. Let me check the publication dates.

The Hitchhiker's Guide series has five books. The first was 1979, then "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe" in 1980, "Life, the Universe and Everything" in 1982, "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish" in 1984, and "Mostly Harmless" in 1992. So the 1984 book is the fourth one. The title is "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish." Let me confirm the exact release date. I think it was published in November 1984. The user specified November 9th, which might be the exact date. So the answer should be that book. I need to make sure there's no other book by Adams from that date. He also wrote other works, but the main one in 1984 is the fourth Hitchhiker's book. Yeah, that's the one.
