Okay, so I need to figure out which famous book by Philip Pullman was released on October 10, 2000. Let me start by recalling Philip Pullman's works. He's best known for the His Dark Materials trilogy, which includes "Northern Lights" (also called "The Golden Compass" in the US), "The Subtle Knife," and "The Amber Spyglass." 

Now, the dates. The first book, "Northern Lights," was published in 1995. The second one, "The Subtle Knife," came out in 1997. The third, "The Amber Spyglass," was released in 2000. Wait, the user is asking for a book released on October 10, 2000. Let me check the exact publication date of "The Amber Spyglass." 

I think "The Amber Spyglass" was indeed published in 2000. But I need to confirm the exact date. Some sources might say it was released in October 2000. Let me cross-verify. A quick search in my memory: yes, "The Amber Spyglass" was published on October 10, 2000, in the UK. That fits the date given in the question. 

Are there any other books by Philip Pullman around that time? He also wrote "Lyra's Oxford," which is a companion book to the trilogy, but that was published in 2003. There's also "The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ," but that's from 2008. So the only major book in 2000 is "The Amber Spyglass." 

Therefore, the answer should be "The Amber Spyglass" by Philip Pullman, published on October 10, 2000.
