Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on February 1, 1999, by Stephen Chbosky. Let me start by recalling what I know about Stephen Chbosky. He's an American author and filmmaker. I think he's known for a book that was also made into a movie. The title might be something like "The Perks of Being a Wallflower," but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the details.

First, the release date: 1999-02-01. I should verify if "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" was published on that date. I remember that the book was published in the late 90s, and the movie adaptation came out in 2012. A quick mental note: Stephen Chbosky did write the screenplay for the movie adaptation himself. So if the book was published in 1999, that fits. Let me think if there are any other books by him. I don't recall any other major works by Chbosky besides this one. 

Another way to confirm: The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a well-known coming-of-age story, written as a series of letters from the protagonist, Charlie. It deals with themes like mental health, friendship, and growing up. The publication date being in 1999 seems right. I don't think there's another book by Chbosky that's as famous. Maybe I can cross-check with other authors, but I don't think so. So putting it all together, the answer should be "The Perks of Being a Wallflower."
