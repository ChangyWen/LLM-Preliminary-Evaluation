Okay, so I need to figure out which famous book by Jodi Picoult was released on April 6, 2004. Let me start by recalling Jodi Picoult's works. She's a well-known author with many bestsellers. Some of her popular books include "My Sister's Keeper," "The Tenth Circle," and "Nineteen Minutes." But I need to check the publication dates.

I remember that "My Sister's Keeper" was published in 2004. Let me confirm the exact date. I think it came out in April. If the user says April 6, 2004, that might be the correct date. Let me cross-verify. A quick search in my mind: "My Sister's Keeper" by Jodi Picoult was indeed released in 2004. The exact date is April 6. That matches the user's question. So the answer should be "My Sister's Keeper." I should make sure there aren't any other books by her around that time. For example, "The Tenth Circle" was 2003, and "Nineteen Minutes" was 2006. So yes, "My Sister's Keeper" is the correct one. The user is asking for the name of the book, so the answer is straightforward.
