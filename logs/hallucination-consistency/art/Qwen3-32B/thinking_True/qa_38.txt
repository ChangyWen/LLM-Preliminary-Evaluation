Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on May 22, 2007, by Khaled Hosseini. Let me start by recalling what I know about Khaled Hosseini's works. He's an Afghan-American author, right? His first book was "The Kite Runner," which was published in 2003. That was a huge success. Then, I think he wrote another book after that. Let me check the timeline.

The user is asking about a book from 2007. So between 2003 and 2007, he might have written a second novel. I remember that his second book is called "A Thousand Splendid Suns." Let me confirm the publication date. I think "A Thousand Splendid Suns" was published in 2007. The exact date might be May 22nd. I should verify that. 

Wait, I'm not 100% sure about the exact date. Let me think. I know that "The Kite Runner" was 2003, and "A Thousand Splendid Suns" came out a few years later. If the user says May 22, 2007, that's when the book was released. I can cross-check this in my mind. Yes, I believe "A Thousand Splendid Suns" was indeed published on May 22, 2007. That's the date I've heard associated with it. So the answer should be "A Thousand Splendid Suns."
