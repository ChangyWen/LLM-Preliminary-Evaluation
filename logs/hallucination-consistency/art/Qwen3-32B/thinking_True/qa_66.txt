Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the book released on March 6, 2018, by Tomi Adeyemi. Let me start by recalling what I know about Tomi Adeyemi. I think she's a Nigerian-American author, right? She's known for writing young adult fantasy novels. I remember she had a book that was part of a trilogy. The first book in that series was "Children of Blood and Bone," which I believe came out in 2018. Let me check the date. The user specified March 6, 2018. I think that's correct. The book is set in a fictional West African-inspired kingdom called Orïsha. The main character is Zélie, and the story revolves around magic and a revolution. The sequel was "Children of Virtue and Vengeance," but that came out later, in 2020. So the first book in the series, released in 2018, is definitely "Children of Blood and Bone." I don't think she released any other books around that time. Let me confirm the release date again. Yes, March 6, 2018, matches with that book. I think that's the one.
