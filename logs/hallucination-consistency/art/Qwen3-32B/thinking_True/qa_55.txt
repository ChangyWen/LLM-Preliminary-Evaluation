Okay, so I need to find out the name of the famous book released on October 10, 2013, created by Tom Bissell. Let me start by recalling what I know about Tom Bissell. He's an American writer and translator, known for his works in both fiction and non-fiction. I remember he's written about video games, like "Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter," but that was published in 2010. 

Now, the user is asking for a book from 2013-10-10. Let me check my memory. I think he wrote a book about the Vietnam War, maybe "Chasing the Sea: Lost Among the Ghosts of Vietnam." Wait, but when was that published? I'm not sure. Let me think. Another possibility is "The Disaster Artist," but that's by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell co-wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation. No, the book "The Disaster Artist" was published in 2017. 

Wait, maybe it's "The Future Won't Be as Weird as We Think" or something else? No, that doesn't ring a bell. Let me try to recall. Oh, there's a book called "The Possible" by Tom Bissell. Let me check the publication date. If I remember correctly, "The Possible" was published in 2013. Let me confirm the exact date. If it's October 10, 2013, that might be the one. 

Alternatively, maybe "The Nine Cloud Dream," but that's a translation of a Korean novel. Hmm. Another angle: sometimes authors release books with specific themes. Tom Bissell has written about war and personal experiences. "Chasing the Sea" was about Vietnam, but I think that was published in 2001. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me try to look up in my mind. 

Wait, "The Disaster Artist" was a book about the making of "The Room," but that was a 2017 book. Tom Bissell was involved in the movie adaptation, but not the book. So that's not it. 

Another thought: "Extra Lives" was 2010, "Chasing the Sea" 2001, "The Father of All Things" 2006. Then maybe "The Possible" in 2013. Let me check the publication date of "The Possible." If it's October 2013, that's the one. I think "The Possible" was published by Harper Perennial in October 2013. The exact date might be October 10. 

So, putting it all together, the answer is likely "The Possible" by Tom Bissell, released on October 10, 2013.
