Okay, so the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 13, 1953, created by Ian Fleming. Let me start by recalling Ian Fleming's works. He's best known for creating James Bond, right? The first James Bond novel was "Casino Royale." Wait, when was that published? I think it was 1953. Let me check the dates. Yes, "Casino Royale" was indeed published in 1953. Now, the exact dateâ€”April 13th. I need to confirm if that's correct. Some sources might say the UK release was in 1953, and maybe the specific date is April 13. Alternatively, sometimes the date might be a bit off depending on the edition. But I'm pretty sure "Casino Royale" is the first Bond novel, and the 1953 release date is accurate. Let me cross-verify. A quick search in my memory: yes, Ian Fleming wrote "Casino Royale" and it was published on April 13, 1953, in the UK. That's the one. The user is probably looking for that title. I don't think there are any other books by Fleming from that exact date. So the answer should be "Casino Royale."
