Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 15, 1977, created by J.R.R. Tolkien. Hmm, first, I need to recall what books Tolkien wrote. The most well-known are The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion. But wait, The Silmarillion was published posthumously in 1977, right? Let me check the dates.

J.R.R. Tolkien died in 1973, so any book published in 1977 would have been edited by his son, Christopher Tolkien. The Silmarillion was indeed published in 1977, edited by Christopher. The release date might be around September. Let me confirm the exact date. Yes, The Silmarillion was released on September 15, 1977. The user might be mixing up the release date with the Star Wars movie, which came out in May 1977, but that's a different work. So the answer should be The Silmarillion.
