Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on January 16, 2018, by Jordan Peterson. Let me start by recalling what I know about Jordan Peterson. He's a psychologist and professor known for his work in personality and political psychology. He's been in the news a lot, especially for his book that became a bestseller.

I remember that his most well-known book is "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos." I think that was published around 2018. Let me check the dates. If I recall correctly, the book was released in January 2018. The exact date might be January 16th. I should verify this. 

Another way to confirm is to think about the release timeline. "12 Rules for Life" was a huge hit, becoming a number one bestseller on the New York Times. It's been widely discussed in both academic and popular circles. The title makes sense because it outlines twelve rules for living a meaningful life, which aligns with Peterson's focus on personal responsibility and self-improvement. 

I don't think he published another major book around that time. His other works, like "Maps of Meaning," were published earlier, in 1999. So the 2018 release is definitely "12 Rules for Life." The date January 16, 2018, matches the publication date I've seen cited for that book. Therefore, the answer should be "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos."
