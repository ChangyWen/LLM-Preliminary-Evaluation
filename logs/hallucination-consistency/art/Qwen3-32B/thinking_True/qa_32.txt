Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on July 2, 2002, created by Neil Gaiman. First, I need to confirm the author's full name. The user provided "Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman," but I know he's commonly known as Neil Gaiman. The middle names might be correct, but I'm not sure if they're necessary here.

Next, the release date is July 2, 2002. I should think about Neil Gaiman's works around that time. His most famous books include "Good Omens" (co-written with Terry Pratchett), "Sandman" (a graphic novel series), "American Gods," "Coraline," and "The Graveyard Book." 

"Coraline" was published in 2002. Let me check the exact date. Yes, "Coraline" by Neil Gaiman was released on July 2, 2002. It's a children's fantasy novel that became quite popular. The user might be referring to this one. 

I should also consider if there are any other books by Gaiman around that date. "The Graveyard Book" came out in 2008, so that's later. "American Gods" was 2001, so before 2002. "Good Omens" was 1990. So "Coraline" fits the date. 

I think that's the correct answer. Let me double-check the publication date to be sure. A quick search in my mind: yes, "Coraline" was indeed published on July 2, 2002. The illustrator is Dave McKean, but the user didn't ask about that. The title is definitely "Coraline."
