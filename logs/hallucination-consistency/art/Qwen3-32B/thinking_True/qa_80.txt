Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on April 12, 2005, created by Stephen Dubner. Let me start by recalling what I know about Stephen Dubner. He's an economist and journalist, right? I remember he's known for co-authoring a book that's part of the Freakonomics series. The main one is "Freakonomics," which was pretty popular. But wait, when was that published? Let me check my memory. I think "Freakonomics" was published in 2005. The first book in the series came out in 2005, and then there were sequels like "SuperFreakonomics" later on.

So if the question is about a book released on April 12, 2005, that would be the first "Freakonomics" book. Let me confirm the exact date. I recall that the original "Freakonomics" by Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt was indeed published in April 2005. The exact date might be April 12, but I'm not 100% sure. However, given that the user is asking for the name of the book, and considering Dubner's most famous work, it's almost certainly "Freakonomics." 

I should also consider if there are any other books by Dubner around that time. He has written other books, like "Think Like a Freak" with Levitt again, but that was published in 2014. So the 2005 release is definitely the first "Freakonomics." The date might be a specific detail, but since the user is asking for the name, the answer is "Freakonomics."
