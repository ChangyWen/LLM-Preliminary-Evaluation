Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on January 12, 2016, written by Paul Kalanithi. Let me start by recalling what I know about Paul Kalanithi. He was a neurosurgeon, right? I remember reading something about him writing a book about his experience with terminal illness. Wait, wasn't it called "When Breath Becomes Air"? That sounds familiar. Let me check the dates. The book was published in 2016, and the author was Paul Kalanithi. He passed away from lung cancer, I think. The title "When Breath Becomes Air" does ring a bell as his memoir. I should confirm the publication date. A quick search in my mindâ€”yes, I believe it was released in early 2016, maybe January. The exact date given here is January 12th, which matches. So the answer should be "When Breath Becomes Air."
