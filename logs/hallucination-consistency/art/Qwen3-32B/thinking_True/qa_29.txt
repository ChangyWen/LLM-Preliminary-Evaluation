Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on May 23, 2017, by Kevin Kwan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Kevin Kwan. He's a Singaporean author, right? His most well-known work is the "Crazy Rich Asians" trilogy. The first book in that series was "Crazy Rich Asians," which was published in 2013. Then there was a sequel, "China Rich Girlfriend," released in 2015. Now, the user is asking about a book from 2017. I think the third book in the trilogy came out around that time. Let me check the dates. The third book is "Rich People Problems," and I believe it was published in May 2017. Let me confirm the exact date. Yes, I think it was May 23, 2017. That matches the date the user provided. So the answer should be "Rich People Problems" by Kevin Kwan.
