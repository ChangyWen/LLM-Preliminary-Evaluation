Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on May 12, 1969, by Michael Crichton. Let me start by recalling what I know about Michael Crichton. He's a well-known author, famous for writing techno-thrillers. Some of his most popular works include "Jurassic Park" and "The Andromeda Strain." Wait, "The Andromeda Strain" was published in 1969, right? Let me check the dates. If the user is asking for a book released on May 12, 1969, that's a specific date. I think "The Andromeda Strain" was indeed published in 1969. Let me confirm the exact date. I remember that "The Andromeda Strain" was Crichton's first novel, and it was published in 1969. The exact release date might be around that time. I think the initial publication was in May, so May 12th could be the correct date. I don't recall any other major books by Crichton from that year. "Jurassic Park" came much later, in 1990. So putting it all together, the answer is likely "The Andromeda Strain."
