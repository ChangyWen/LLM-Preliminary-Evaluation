Okay, so the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Stephen King that was released on September 8, 1981. Let me think. Stephen King has written a lot of books, but I need to find one that fits that specific date.

First, I'll recall some of his most well-known works. "The Shining" was published in 1977, so that's too early. "Salem's Lot" came out in 1975. "It" was published in 1986, so that's later. Then there's "The Stand," which was first released in 1978. Hmm, not matching the 1981 date.

Wait, what about "The Dead Zone"? Let me check. I think "The Dead Zone" was published in 1979. No, that's not it either. Maybe "Cujo"? That was 1981. Wait, the user mentioned September 8, 1981. Let me confirm the exact release date of "Cujo." I believe "Cujo" was indeed published in 1981. Let me double-check the exact date. Yes, Stephen King's "Cujo" was released on September 8, 1981. That matches the date the user provided. 

I should make sure there aren't any other books by King from that exact date. Another possibility could be "Firestarter," but that was 1980. "The Running Man" was 1982. So "Cujo" seems to be the correct answer here. The user is asking for the name, so the answer should be "Cujo."
