Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on October 17, 1990, created by William Steig. Let me start by recalling what I know about William Steig. He was an American cartoonist and author, known for his children's books. One of his most famous works is "Shrek!", which was a picture book published in 1990. Wait, the date here is October 17, 1990. Let me check if that's correct.

I remember that "Shrek!" was indeed published in 1990. The exact date might be October 17th. The book was a picture book, and it's the one that later became the basis for the Shrek movie series. William Steig's other works include "The Amazing Bone" and "Abel's Island," but those were published earlier. Let me confirm the publication date. A quick search in my memory: yes, "Shrek!" was released in 1990. The exact date might be October 17th. Since the user is asking for the name of the book, the answer is likely "Shrek!" by William Steig. I should make sure there aren't any other books by him from that exact date, but I don't recall any other major titles from that time. So, the answer should be "Shrek!" published on October 17, 1990.
