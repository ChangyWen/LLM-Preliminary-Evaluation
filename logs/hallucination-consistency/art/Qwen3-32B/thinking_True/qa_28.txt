Okay, so the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Stephen King that was released on April 5, 1974. Let me think. I know Stephen King has written a lot of popular books, but I need to figure out which one came out on that specific date.

First, I should recall some of his early works. His first novel was "Carrie," which I believe was published in 1974. Let me check the exact date. I think "Carrie" was released in April 1974. The user mentioned April 5th, so that might be the correct date. 

Wait, I should verify if there are any other books by King from that time. "Salem's Lot" was published in 1975, so that's later. "The Shining" came out in 1977. So "Carrie" is the one from 1974. Let me confirm the exact release date. I remember reading that "Carrie" was published on April 5, 1974. That matches the user's question. 

I think that's the answer. The user is probably looking for "Carrie" by Stephen King. Let me make sure there's no other book with the same date. I don't recall any other major Stephen King novels from that exact date. So the answer should be "Carrie."
