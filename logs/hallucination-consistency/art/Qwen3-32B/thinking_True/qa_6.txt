Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on February 28, 2002, by Richard K. Morgan. Let me start by recalling what I know about Richard K. Morgan. He's a science fiction and fantasy author, right? I remember he wrote some cyberpunk or space opera novels. The most famous one that comes to mind is "Altered Carbon," but wait, when was that published? Let me check my memory. "Altered Carbon" was actually published in 2002. The date mentioned here is February 28, 2002. So that might be the one. But I should make sure there aren't any other books by him from that time. Let me think. He also wrote "The Steel Remains" and "Thirteen," but those came out later. "Altered Carbon" was his debut novel, I believe. The release date matches the year 2002. I think the exact date might be February 28. Let me confirm. A quick search in my mind: yes, "Altered Carbon" was indeed released in 2002, and the specific date is February 28. That fits the question. So the answer should be "Altered Carbon."
