Okay, so I need to figure out which famous book by Robert A. Heinlein was released on November 5, 1959. Let me start by recalling Heinlein's major works. He wrote a lot of science fiction novels, some of which are quite well-known. The first thing that comes to mind is "Stranger in a Strange Land," but I think that was published later, maybe in the 1960s. Wait, let me check the dates.

Another one of his famous books is "Starship Troopers." I believe that was published in 1959. Let me confirm the exact date. If I remember correctly, "Starship Troopers" was indeed released in 1959. The exact date might be November 5th. Heinlein's works often deal with military themes, and "Starship Troopers" is about a future where citizenship is earned through military service. That fits with the 1950s era of science fiction. 

I should also consider other possibilities. "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" was published in 1966, so that's later. "Red Planet" was 1949. "Have Space Suitâ€”Will Travel" is from 1958. So the 1959 date points to "Starship Troopers." Let me double-check the publication date. A quick search in my memory: yes, "Starship Troopers" was published in November 1959. The exact date might be the 5th. I think that's correct. So the answer should be "Starship Troopers."
