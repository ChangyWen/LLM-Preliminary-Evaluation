Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book by Patricia Highsmith that was released on November 30, 1955. Let me start by recalling what I know about Patricia Highsmith. She's an American author known for her psychological thrillers. Her most famous work is probably "The Talented Mr. Ripley," but I need to check the publication dates.

Wait, "The Talented Mr. Ripley" was published in 1955. Let me confirm the exact date. I think it was released in November. The user specified November 30, 1955. So maybe that's the one. But I should make sure there aren't other books by her around that time. Highsmith wrote several novels, including "Strangers on a Train," which was published in 1950. Then there's "The Price of Salt," which came out in 1952. 

Looking up the publication date for "The Talented Mr. Ripley," I remember it was indeed 1955. Let me check the exact month. Some sources say it was published in October 1955, but maybe the user is referring to a different edition or a specific release date. Wait, maybe the initial publication was in October, but perhaps the hardcover release in the US was November 30? Or maybe it's a different country's release date. Alternatively, could there be another book? 

Another possibility is "The Glass Key," but that's by Dashiell Hammett. No, Highsmith's works include "The Talented Mr. Ripley," "Strangers on a Train," "The Price of Salt," and "The Two Faces of January." The first Ripley novel is "The Talented Mr. Ripley," which is part of a series. Let me verify the exact publication date. According to my knowledge, "The Talented Mr. Ripley" was published in 1955 by Harper & Row. The exact date might be October 1955, but the user says November 30. Maybe there's a discrepancy here. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the UK publication date. Let me check. The UK edition was published in 1955 as well, but the exact date might differ. However, the user is asking for the book released on November 30, 1955. If the US release was in October, maybe the UK was in November. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user has the date slightly off. 

Given that "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is her most famous book and was published in 1955, and considering that the exact date might be a common confusion, I think the answer is "The Talented Mr. Ripley." Even if the date is slightly off, it's the most likely candidate. I'll go with that.
