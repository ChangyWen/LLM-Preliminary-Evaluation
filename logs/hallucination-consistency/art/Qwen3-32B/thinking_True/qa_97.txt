Okay, so I need to figure out which famous book Madonna created that was released on October 21, 1992. Let me start by recalling what I know about Madonna and her works. She's a pop icon, known for her music, but she's also ventured into other areas like film and literature. 

First, I remember that Madonna has written several books. The most well-known ones are probably "Sex" and "Hard Candy." Let me check the dates. "Sex" was published in 1992, right? I think that's the one. But wait, the exact date? I'm not 100% sure. Let me think. "Sex" was a controversial coffee-table book that was quite explicit, which caused a lot of talk at the time. It was released in October 1992. The date might be October 21. I need to confirm if that's correct.

Another possibility is "Hard Candy," but I believe that came out later, maybe in 2008. So that's not it. There's also "MDNA," but that's a book from 2012. So the 1992 one is "Sex." Let me double-check. A quick search in my memory: yes, "Sex" was published in October 1992. The exact date might be the 21st. I think the release date was October 21, 1992. That matches the question. So the answer should be "Sex" by Madonna.
