Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on April 12, 2005, created by Steven Levitt. Let me start by recalling what I know about Steven Levitt. He's an economist, right? I think he's known for some popular books that apply economic theories to everyday life or unusual topics.

Wait, there's a book called "Freakonomics" that I remember. The author is Steven Levitt, and I think he co-authored it with someone else. Let me check the details. The release date... I'm not exactly sure, but I think "Freakonomics" was published around 2005. Let me confirm the exact date. If the user says April 12, 2005, that's probably correct. Also, the co-author is Stephen J. Dubner. So the full title would be "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything." 

I should make sure there aren't any other books by Levitt around that time. He wrote another book called "SuperFreakonomics" later, but that was in 2010. So the 2005 one is definitely "Freakonomics." The date matches, the author, and the co-author. Yeah, that's the one. It became really popular for looking at topics like crime, parenting, and sumo wrestling through an economic lens. So the answer should be "Freakonomics" by Steven Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, published on April 12, 2005.
