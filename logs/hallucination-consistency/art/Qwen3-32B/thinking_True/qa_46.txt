Okay, so I need to figure out which famous book by Haruki Murakami was released on May 29, 2009. Let me start by recalling some of his well-known works. Murakami has written several novels, including "Norwegian Wood," "Kafka on the Shore," "1Q84," and "Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage." 

First, I should check the publication dates of these books. "Norwegian Wood" was originally published in 1987 in Japan, so that's not it. "Kafka on the Shore" came out in 2002, so that's earlier than 2009. "1Q84" is a trilogy that started in 2009, but I think the first volume was released in Japan in 2009. Wait, the user specified May 29, 2009. Let me confirm the exact date for "1Q84." 

I remember that "1Q84" was published in three parts in Japan. The first volume, "1Q84 1," was released on May 29, 2009. The second and third volumes followed later in the year. So the initial release date matches the date given in the question. The other book mentioned, "Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki..." was published in 2013, so that's later. 

Therefore, the book in question is likely the first volume of "1Q84." The title is "1Q84 1," but since the user is asking for the name of the famous book, it's probably just referred to as "1Q84," with the note that the first volume was released on that date. I should double-check to make sure there aren't any other books by Murakami around that time. Let me think... No, "1Q84" is the one that fits the date. So the answer should be "1Q84."
