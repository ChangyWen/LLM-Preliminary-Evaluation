Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on March 7, 2000, by Mark Z. Danielewski. Let me start by recalling what I know about him. Mark Z. Danielewski is an author known for his experimental and visually unique books. One of his most famous works is "House of Leaves," which I remember is a complex, multi-layered novel with a lot of footnotes and different typographic styles. 

Now, checking the release date. I think "House of Leaves" was published in 2000. Let me confirm the exact date. I recall that the first edition was indeed published in March 2000. The specific date might be March 7th. I should verify this. A quick search in my memory or maybe some known facts: yes, "House of Leaves" by Mark Z. Danielewski was released on March 7, 2000. It's a horror novel that's become quite iconic in the literary world because of its unconventional structure and presentation. The book is known for its intricate design, including footnotes that sometimes extend beyond the main text, different fonts, and even some pages that are upside down or have mirrored text. It's often cited as a postmodern work and has a cult following. 

I don't think Danielewski has another major book that was released around that time. His other works include "Only Revolutions" which came out later, in 2006. So the 2000 release is definitely "House of Leaves." The date March 7th lines up with the initial publication date. Therefore, the answer should be "House of Leaves."
