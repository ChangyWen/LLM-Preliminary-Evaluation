Okay, so I need to figure out which famous book by Robert A. Heinlein was released on June 1, 1961. Let me start by recalling some of Heinlein's well-known works. He wrote a lot of science fiction novels, so I should list some of his most popular ones and check their publication dates.

First, "Stranger in a Strange Land" comes to mind. I think that was published in the early 1960s. Let me check the exact date. If I remember correctly, "Stranger in a Strange Land" was published in 1961. But wait, was it June 1st? I'm not entirely sure. Another one is "Starship Troopers," which I believe was published earlier, maybe 1959. Then there's "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress," which I think came out in the 1960s as well, but I'm not certain of the exact year. 

Let me try to verify. Heinlein's bibliography: "Stranger in a Strange Land" was indeed published in 1961. Now, the exact date... I think it was June, but I need to confirm. Some sources say it was released in June 1961. If the user is specifying June 1st, that might be the correct date. I should cross-check this. 

Another possibility is that there's another book, but I can't recall another major Heinlein novel from that exact date. "The Puppet Masters" was published in 1951, so that's too early. "Time for the Stars" was 1958. So "Stranger in a Strange Land" seems like the most likely candidate. 

I think the answer is "Stranger in a Strange Land" by Robert A. Heinlein, published on June 1, 1961. Let me just make sure there's no other book. Maybe a collection? But the user mentioned a "famous book," which is more likely a novel. Yes, "Stranger in a Strange Land" is his most famous work from that period. The publication date matches the given date. So I'm pretty confident that's the correct answer.
