Okay, so I need to find out the name of the famous book released on September 19, 2012, by Joël Dicker. Let me start by recalling what I know about Joël Dicker. He's a Swiss author, right? I think he's written a few books, but one of them became really popular. The date is specific, so maybe it's his most well-known work.

Wait, I remember a book called "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair." That sounds familiar. Let me check the details. The book was published in French first as "La Vérité sur l'affaire Harry Quebert" in 2012. The English translation came out later, but the original release date was in 2012. The author is indeed Joël Dicker. The plot involves a mystery around a missing girl and a famous author. The release date in French was September 19, 2012. That matches the date the user mentioned. 

I should verify if there are any other books by Dicker around that time. He also wrote "The Book of All Lies," but that was published in 2014. So the 2012 one is definitely "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair." The title might be translated differently in English, but the original French title and the English translation are both well-known. The user is asking for the name of the book, so the answer should be that one. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure there's no confusion with other authors or similar titles. No, I'm pretty confident it's that book.
