Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book by Richard Dawkins that was released on October 2, 2006. Let me start by recalling what I know about Dawkins' works. He's a well-known evolutionary biologist and author, famous for "The Selfish Gene," which was published in 1976. That's a classic, but the question is about a 2006 book.

I remember that Dawkins has written several other books. There's "The God Delusion," which I think came out around 2006. Let me check the dates. "The God Delusion" was published in 2006, and I believe the release date was October 2. That seems to fit the question. But wait, I should make sure there aren't any other books by him from that time. Let me think. He also wrote "River Out of Eden" in 1995, and "Climbing Mount Improbable" in 1996. More recently, he has "The Greatest Show on Earth" in 2009 and "Brief Candle in the Dark" in 2016. So between 2006, the main one is "The God Delusion." 

I should confirm the exact publication date. A quick search in my memory: "The God Delusion" was published on October 2, 2006. Yes, that's correct. It's a book that argues against the existence of God and criticizes religion, which made it quite controversial and popular. So the answer should be "The God Delusion."
