Okay, so I need to find out the name of the famous book released on April 14, 2003, written by Lionel Shriver. Let me start by recalling what I know about Lionel Shriver. She's a British author known for her novels that often tackle controversial social issues. Some of her well-known works include "We Need to Talk About Kevin," which I remember was published around 2003. Wait, was that the exact date? Let me check my memory. I think "We Need to Talk About Kevin" was published in 2003, and the release date might be April 14th. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think if there are other books by her around that time. She also wrote "The Rendition," but that was in 2000. "A Family Trade" came out in 2002. Then "So Much for That" in 2009. So the 2003 one is likely "We Need to Talk About Kevin." Let me confirm the publication date. I recall that the UK edition was in 2003, and the US edition might have been a bit later. But the user specified April 14, 2003. Maybe that's the UK release date. Alternatively, maybe it's another book. Wait, I should check if there's any other book by her in that timeframe. Let me think. No, I think "We Need to Talk About Kevin" is the one. The plot revolves around a mother reflecting on her relationship with her son, who committed a school shooting. It's a critically acclaimed novel and was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. The release date aligns with the user's question. So I'm pretty confident the answer is "We Need to Talk About Kevin."
