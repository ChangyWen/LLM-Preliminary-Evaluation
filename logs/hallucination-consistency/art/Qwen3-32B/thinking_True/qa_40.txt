Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on September 13, 2016, by Mark Manson. Let me start by recalling what I know about Mark Manson. He's an author known for self-help and personal development books. His most famous work is probably "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck," which I remember was a bestseller. But wait, when was that published? Let me check my memory. I think "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" came out in 2016. The exact date might be around that time. Let me confirm the release date. A quick search in my mind... Yes, I believe it was September 13, 2016. That matches the date the user provided. So the book in question is "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" by Mark Manson. I don't think he has another book released on that date. Another one of his books is "Everything Is F*cked," but that was published later, in 2019. So the answer should be the first one.
