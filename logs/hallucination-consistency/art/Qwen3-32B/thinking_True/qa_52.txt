Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on May 19, 1988, by Thomas Harris. Let me start by recalling Thomas Harris's works. He's known for writing psychological thrillers. The most famous ones I can think of are "The Silence of the Lambs," "Red Dragon," and "Hannibal." 

Wait, "The Silence of the Lambs" was a big one. But when was that published? I think that came out in 1988. Let me check the dates. The user specified May 19, 1988. I remember that "The Silence of the Lambs" is part of the Hannibal Lecter series. The first book, "Red Dragon," was published in 1981. Then "The Silence of the Lambs" followed. I believe the publication date for "The Silence of the Lambs" is indeed 1988. Let me confirm the exact date. Some sources say it was released in May 1988. That matches the user's query. 

Another book by Harris is "Hannibal," which came out later, in 1999. So that's not it. The other one is "The Red Dragon," but that's from 1981. So the only one left is "The Silence of the Lambs." The date fits, and it's a very famous book, especially since it won the Pulitzer Prize. Yeah, that must be the one. I think that's correct.
