Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the book released on May 26, 2015, by Jenny Han. Let me start by recalling what I know about Jenny Han. She's an author known for young adult fiction, especially the "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" series. The first book in that series came out in 2014, right? The sequel was released in 2015. Let me check the dates.

The first book, "To All the Boys I've Loved Before," was published in 2014. The second book in the series is "P.S. I Still Love You," which I think came out in 2015. If the date is May 26, 2015, that might be the release date for the second book. I should confirm if that's correct. I remember that the third book, "Always and Forever, Lara Jean," was released later, maybe in 2017. So the 2015 release would be the second one. Let me make sure there aren't any other books by her around that time. I don't think so. Jenny Han has written other books, but the main one in 2015 would be the sequel to her popular series. Yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is "P.S. I Still Love You."
