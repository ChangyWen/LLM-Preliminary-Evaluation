Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book by Michael Crichton that was released on September 8, 1995. Let me start by recalling what I know about Michael Crichton's works. He's well-known for writing techno-thrillers and science fiction. Some of his most famous books include "Jurassic Park," which was a huge success and later adapted into a movie. But that was published in 1990, so not the one in question here.

Now, the date given is 1995-09-08. Let me think about his other works. After "Jurassic Park," he wrote "The Lost World," which is a sequel. I believe "The Lost World" was published in 1995. Let me check the exact date. If I remember correctly, "The Lost World" was released in September 1995. The exact date might be around that time. Another one of his books is "Timeline," but that was published in 1999. "Prey" came later, in 2002. "State of Fear" was 2004. So narrowing it down, the 1995 release is likely "The Lost World." 

Wait, let me confirm. "The Lost World" is the sequel to "Jurassic Park," and it was indeed published in 1995. The exact release date might be September 8th. I think that's correct. I don't recall any other major Crichton books from that time. So the answer should be "The Lost World."
