*************************************** Thinking ***************************************

Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 13, 2007, created by Pablo Fenjves. Hmm, first, I need to check if Pablo Fenjves is a known author. I'm not immediately familiar with that name. Maybe it's a pseudonym or a less-known author? Let me think.

Wait, the date is 2007-09-13. That's September 13, 2007. What books were released around that time? Some big releases in 2007... "The Casual Vacancy" by J.K. Rowling was in 2012, so that's later. "The Kite Runner" was 2003. "The Da Vinci Code" was 2003 as well. Maybe a non-fiction book? Or perhaps a book that's not in English?

Wait, maybe the user made a typo in the name. Let me check the spelling of the author's name again. Pablo Fenjves. Hmm. Maybe it's a misspelling. Let me think of similar names. Pablo is a common first name, like Pablo Picasso, but he's an artist. Fenjves... Maybe it's a variation of "Fenves"? There's a Gregory Fenves, but he's an academic. Alternatively, maybe it's a different name altogether. Could it be "Pablo Escobar"? No, he's a drug lord, not an author. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that was created in a different context, like a screenplay or a comic book. Wait, the user said "book," so probably a novel or non-fiction. Let me check if there's any book by Pablo Fenjves released on that date. 

I can try to recall if any notable books from 2007 have that author. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that was published in Spanish or another language, and the author's name is transliterated differently. For example, "Fenjves" might be a Spanish or Portuguese name. Let me think. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is confused and the author's name is different. Let me check online... Wait, I can't access the internet, but I can rely on my existing knowledge. Hmm. Another angle: the date September 13, 2007. What's significant about that date? Maybe a book that was released on a specific day, like a September 13th. 

Wait, maybe it's a book that's part of a series or a well-known author's work. Let me think of 2007 releases. "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay" by Michael Chabon was 2000. "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius" by Dave Eggers was 2000. "The Road" by Cormac McCarthy was 2006. "The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao" by Junot Díaz was 2007. Wait, that's a possibility. But the author is Junot Díaz, not Pablo Fenjves. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a book that was translated or published under a different name. Alternatively, maybe it's a book that's not in English. For example, a Spanish-language book. Let me think. If the author is Pablo Fenjves, maybe it's a book from Latin America. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that's part of a franchise or a well-known series. For example, "The Dark Knight" movie was 2008, but maybe a related book? Not sure. 

Wait, another thought: sometimes books are released in different countries on different dates. The user specified September 13, 2007. Maybe it's a book that was released in a specific country on that date. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken about the author's name. Let me think of authors with similar names. Pablo Neruda was a poet, but he's deceased. Pablo Coelho, Paulo Coelho, the Brazilian author. He wrote "The Alchemist," but that was 1988. Maybe a newer book? "The Pilgrimage" was 1984. Not 2007. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a book that's not a novel but something else, like a cookbook or a technical book. But the user mentioned "famous," so probably a well-known book. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that was released in 2007 but became famous later. For example, "The Help" by Kathryn Stockett was 2009. 

Hmm. I'm not coming up with anything. Maybe the author's name is misspelled. Let me try to think of "Pablo" as part of the name. Pablo is a common first name. Maybe the user meant "Pablo" as part of the title? Like "Pablo Honey" by Radiohead? No, that's an album. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a book that was created by Pablo Fenjves, but it's not a well-known book. However, the user specified "famous," so it's supposed to be a well-known one. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that was released on that date in a specific region. For example, in the UK vs. the US. 

Wait, another angle: the date September 13, 2007. Let me check if any notable events happened on that date that might relate to a book. For example, maybe a book was released in conjunction with an event. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that was published by a specific publisher. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that there's no famous book by Pablo Fenjves released on that date, and the user might have made a mistake in the name or the date. Alternatively, maybe it's a lesser-known book. 

Wait, let me check if "Pablo Fenjves" is a real author. A quick search in my knowledge base... Hmm, I don't recall any author by that name. Maybe it's a fictional name or a misspelling. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that was created in a different medium, like a screenplay or a play, but the user said "book." 

Given that I can't find any information on Pablo Fenjves as an author of a famous book released on September 13, 2007, it's possible that there's a mistake in the name or the date. However, if I have to provide an answer based on the given information, I might have to state that there's no known famous book by that author on that date. But the user is asking for the name, so perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a book that was released in 2007 but the author's name is similar. For example, "The Kite Runner" by Khaled Hosseini was 2003. "The Reluctant Fundamentalist" by Mohsin Hamid was 2007. But again, the author's name is different. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that was published in Spanish, and the author's name is Pablo Fenjves. For example, in Spanish-speaking countries, maybe a book by that author. But I don't have information on that. 

Given all this, I think the most plausible answer is that there is no famous book by Pablo Fenjves released on September 13, 2007. However, since the user is asking for the name, perhaps there's a specific book they're thinking of, but I can't recall it. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different work, like a movie or a game, but the question specifies a book. 

In conclusion, based on my current knowledge, I can't identify a famous book by Pablo Fenjves released on that date. It's possible there's a mistake in the author's name or the date provided.
