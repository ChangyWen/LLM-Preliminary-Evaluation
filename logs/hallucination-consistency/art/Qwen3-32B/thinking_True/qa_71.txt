Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the book released on July 22, 1997, by Philip Pullman. Let me start by recalling Philip Pullman's works. He's most famous for the His Dark Materials trilogy. The first book in that series is "Northern Lights," which is also known as "The Golden Compass" in the US. I think the original UK release was in 1995, but maybe there was a reissue or a different edition in 1997? Wait, the user is asking for a book released in 1997-07-22. Let me check the publication dates.

The first book, "Northern Lights," was published in the UK in 1995. The second book, "The Subtle Knife," came out in 1997. Oh, right! "The Subtle Knife" was published in 1997. Let me confirm the exact date. If the user says July 22, 1997, that's likely the publication date for "The Subtle Knife." The third book, "The Amber Spyglass," was published in 2000. So the 1997 release would be the second book in the trilogy. Therefore, the answer should be "The Subtle Knife."
