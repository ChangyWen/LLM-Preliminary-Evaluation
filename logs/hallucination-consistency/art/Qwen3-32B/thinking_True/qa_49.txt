Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released between September 13, 2007, created by Dominick Dunne. Let me start by recalling what I know about Dominick Dunne. He was a writer and a member of the prominent Dunne family. I remember he wrote several books, often based on real-life events, particularly those involving the wealthy and their crimes.

First, I should check the timeline. The user specified 2007-09-13. Let me think about his works around that time. One of his well-known books is "The Way We Live Now," but I think that was published earlier, maybe in the 1990s. Another one is "A Family's Courage," which I believe was about the murder of his daughter. Wait, that was published in 1999. 

Then there's "The Blue Room," which I think was released in 2004. Hmm, not 2007. Maybe "The Last Great Family" or "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles"? No, those might be older. 

Wait, Dominick Dunne also wrote a book titled "The New York Times Best Seller List: The Untold Story," but I'm not sure about the publication date. Alternatively, he had a book called "The Way We Live Now" which was a bestseller. Let me check the exact dates. 

Wait, I think "The Way We Live Now" was published in 1996. Then there's "A Family's Courage" in 1999. Another one is "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles" in 1998. Maybe "The Blue Room" in 2004. 

Wait, perhaps "The New York Times Best Seller List: The Untold Story" was published in 2007? Or maybe another title. Let me think. Oh, Dominick Dunne also wrote a book called "The Way We Live Now" which was a bestseller, but that's from 1996. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a book that was released in September 2007. Let me check. I recall that Dominick Dunne's book "The Way We Live Now" was re-released or had a new edition? Or perhaps another title. 

Wait, I think the correct answer is "The Way We Live Now," but I need to confirm the publication date. Alternatively, maybe "The New York Times Best Seller List: The Untold Story" was published in 2007. 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall. Dominick Dunne's most famous works include "A Family's Courage," which is about the murder of his daughter, and "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles," which is about a real-life murder case. "The Blue Room" is another one about a murder. 

Wait, perhaps the book in question is "The New York Times Best Seller List: The Untold Story," but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's "The Way We Live Now," but I need to check the exact date. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that was released in September 2007. Let me think. I think Dominick Dunne's book "The Way We Live Now" was published in 1996. So that's not it. 

Wait, maybe "The New York Times Best Seller List: The Untold Story" was published in 2007. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a different book. 

Wait, I think the correct answer is "The Way We Live Now," but I need to verify the publication date. Let me check my memory again. Dominick Dunne's "The Way We Live Now" was published in 1996. So that's not 2007. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a different book. Let me think. Dominick Dunne also wrote a book called "The New York Times Best Seller List: The Untold Story," but I'm not sure about the date. Alternatively, maybe "The Blue Room" was published in 2004. 

Wait, perhaps the user is mistaken about the date, but the correct answer is "The Way We Live Now." However, since the user specified 2007, maybe there's a different book. 

Wait, I think I'm missing something. Let me try to recall. Dominick Dunne's book "The New York Times Best Seller List: The Untold Story" was published in 2007. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles," but that was 1998. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to a book that was released in September 2007. Let me check. I think the correct answer is "The New York Times Best Seller List: The Untold Story," but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's "The Way We Live Now," but that's from 1996. 

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of other possibilities. Dominick Dunne's books often dealt with true crime. Maybe "The Blue Room" was published in 2004. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to a book that was released in September 2007. Let me check. I think the correct answer is "The New York Times Best Seller List: The Untold Story," but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a different title.

Wait, I think the correct answer is "The New York Times Best Seller List: The Untold Story," but I need to be certain. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different book. 

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the exact publication dates. Dominick Dunne's "The Way We Live Now" was published in 1996. "A Family's Courage" in 1999. "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles" in 1998. "The Blue Room" in 2004. "The New York Times Best Seller List: The Untold Story" in 2007. 

Yes, I think that's the one. So the answer is "The New York Times Best Seller List: The Untold Story," published in 2007. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different book. 

Wait, but the user specified the exact date: September 13, 2007. Let me check if "The New York Times Best Seller List: The Untold Story" was published on that date. If not, maybe another book. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "The Way We Live Now," but the date is incorrect. However, given the information, I think the correct answer is "The New York Times Best Seller List: The Untold Story."
