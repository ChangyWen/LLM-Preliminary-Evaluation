Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the book released on October 18, 2007, by Jay Asher. Let me start by recalling what I know about Jay Asher. He's an author, right? I think he's known for a young adult novel that was pretty popular. The title might be something like "Thirteen Reasons Why." Wait, I remember that book was made into a TV show too. Let me check the dates. The book was published in 2007, and the TV show came out later, like in 2017. The release date given here is October 18, 2007, which matches the publication date of "Thirteen Reasons Why." I think that's the one. Let me confirm. The author is indeed Jay Asher, and the book's title is "Thirteen Reasons Why." The date lines up, so I'm pretty confident that's the correct answer.
