Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book by Emma Donoghue that was released on August 6, 2010. Let me start by recalling Emma Donoghue's works. She's an Irish author known for several novels. I remember she wrote "Room," which is a pretty well-known book. But wait, when was that published? Let me check my memory. I think "Room" was published in 2010. The date mentioned here is August 6, 2010. So maybe that's the one.

Wait, but I should make sure there aren't other books by her around that time. Let me think. She has written other books like "The Pull of the Stars" and "Astray," but those are more recent. "Room" definitely came out in 2010. The plot is about a mother and her son living in a room, right? It was also adapted into a movie. The publication date might be a bit tricky. I need to confirm if it's exactly August 6. Sometimes different regions have different release dates, but the initial publication date for the UK or US might be around that time. Let me try to recall if there's any other book by her in 2010. I don't think so. "Room" is her most famous work, and it fits the date. So I'm pretty confident the answer is "Room."
