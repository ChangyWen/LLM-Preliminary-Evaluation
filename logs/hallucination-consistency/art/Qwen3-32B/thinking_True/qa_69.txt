Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on April 30, 2009, by Hilary Mantel. Let me start by recalling what I know about Hilary Mantel's works. She's a British author known for her historical novels, especially those about Thomas Cromwell. I remember she wrote a trilogy about him. The first book in that series is "Wolf Hall," which I think was published around 2009. Let me check the dates.

"Wolf Hall" was indeed published in 2009. The exact date might be April 30th. I should verify that. I know that "Wolf Hall" won the Man Booker Prize in 2009, which adds to its fame. The second book in the trilogy is "Bring Up the Bodies," which came out later, in 2012, and the third is "The Mirror and the Light," published in 2020. So the first one, "Wolf Hall," fits the 2009 release date. The user is asking for the name of the book released on April 30, 2009, so that must be "Wolf Hall." I don't think she published any other major works around that time. Let me make sure there's no other book with the same date. Maybe check if there's a different title or a possible confusion with another author. But Hilary Mantel's most famous work from that period is definitely "Wolf Hall." So the answer should be "Wolf Hall."
