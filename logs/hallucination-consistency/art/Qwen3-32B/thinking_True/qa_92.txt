Okay, so I need to find out the name of the famous book released on May 10, 2016, by Garrard Conley. Let me start by recalling if I know any books from that time. Garrard Conley's name sounds familiar. Wait, there was a book that became a movie, right? It's about a personal experience, maybe something related to conversion therapy? Let me think. Oh, right! The book "Boy Erased" comes to mind. I think that's the one. The author's name is Garrard Conley, and the book was published in 2016. The movie adaptation came out later, maybe in 2018. Let me double-check the date. The user specified May 10, 2016. I should confirm the publication date of "Boy Erased." A quick search in my memory: yes, the book was published in May 2016. The exact date might be around that time. I'm pretty confident that's the correct answer. No other books by Garrard Conley come to mind, and "Boy Erased" fits the description.
