Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 10, 1990, created by Neil Gaiman. First, I need to confirm the author's full name. The user provided "Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman," but I know he's commonly known as Neil Gaiman. The middle names might be correct, but I'm not sure if they're necessary here.

Next, the date is May 10, 1990. I should think about Neil Gaiman's bibliography around that time. His most famous works include "Good Omens" (1990), which he co-wrote with Terry Pratchett. Wait, the user is asking for a book created by Neil Gaiman alone. But "Good Omens" is a collaboration. Are there any other books he wrote solo around that time?

Another possibility is "The Sandman" comic series, but that started in 1989. The first collected volume of "The Sandman" was published in 1990, maybe? Let me check. The first trade paperback of "The Sandman" was released in 1990, but it's a comic book, not a novel. The user might be referring to a novel.

Wait, "Good Omens" was indeed published in 1990. The user might be thinking of that, even though it's a collaboration. But the question specifies "created by Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman," so maybe they're looking for a solo work. Let me think again. 

Another book by Gaiman from around that time is "Neverwhere," but that was published in 1996. "Stardust" came out in 1999. So maybe the user is mistaken about the date. However, the user is specific about May 10, 1990. Let me verify the publication date of "Good Omens." Yes, "Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch" was published on May 10, 1990. Even though it's co-authored, it's a significant work by Gaiman. The user might not be aware of the co-authorship. Alternatively, maybe there's another book. 

Wait, could it be "The Graveyard Book"? No, that was 2008. "American Gods" was 2001. So the only major work by Gaiman in 1990 is "Good Omens." The user might be looking for that, even though it's a collaboration. The question says "created by Neil Gaiman," but perhaps the user is not aware of the co-author. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different work. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of a different book. Let me check if there's any other book by Gaiman in 1990. A quick search in my mind: "Good Omens" is the main one. So I think the answer is "Good Omens," even though it's co-written. The user might have the date right but not the co-author. So I should present that as the answer, noting the co-authorship.
