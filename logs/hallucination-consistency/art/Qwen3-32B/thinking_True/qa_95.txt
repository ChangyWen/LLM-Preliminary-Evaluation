Okay, so I need to find out the name of the book written by Deborah Feldman that was released on February 14, 2012. Let me start by recalling any books I know by that author. I remember that Deborah Feldman wrote a memoir about leaving the Hasidic Jewish community. The title might be something like "Unorthodox," but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the details.

First, I'll confirm the author's name: Deborah Feldman. Yes, that's correct. Now, the release date is February 14, 2012. I think "Unorthodox" was published around that time. Let me verify the publication date. A quick search in my mind (since I can't browse the internet) tells me that "Unorthodox: A Memoir of the Old Believers" was indeed published in 2012. The exact date might be February 14. The book is about her escape from a strict religious community in upstate New York. That matches the description. I don't recall any other books by her from that time. Another possibility could be a different title, but I think "Unorthodox" is the right one. Let me make sure there's no confusion with other authors or similar titles. No, I'm pretty confident it's "Unorthodox."
