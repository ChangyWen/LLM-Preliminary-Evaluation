Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the famous book released on January 1, 2008, by Garth Stein. Let me start by recalling what I know about Garth Stein. He's an American author, and I think he's written a few novels. The most well-known one that comes to mind is "The Art of Racing in the Rain." Wait, when was that published? Let me check my memory. I believe that book was published in 2008. The title sounds familiar, and the author's name matches. But I should make sure there aren't any other books by him from that year.

I can also think about the release date. January 1, 2008, is a specific date. Sometimes books are released on the first of the year, but it's not too common. However, "The Art of Racing in the Rain" was indeed published in 2008. Let me confirm the exact date. A quick search in my mind (since I can't actually browse the internet) tells me that the publication date is January 1, 2008. The book is a bestseller and has been adapted into a film, which might be why it's considered famous. 

Are there any other books by Garth Stein from that time? I don't recall any other major works by him around 2008. He has written other books like "How Evan Broke His Head and Other Secrets," but that was published earlier, in 2004. So, the most likely answer is "The Art of Racing in the Rain." I think that's the correct one. Let me just double-check the details again. Author: Garth Stein, Title: The Art of Racing in the Rain, Publication Date: 2008-01-01. Yes, that all lines up. I don't think there's any confusion here. The book is quite popular, so it's the one the question is referring to.
