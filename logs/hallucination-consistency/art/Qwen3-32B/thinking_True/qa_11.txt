Okay, so I need to figure out which famous book by Kurt Vonnegut was released on March 31, 1969. Let me start by recalling what I know about Vonnegut's works. He's a well-known American author, part of the postmodernist movement. Some of his most famous books include "Slaughterhouse-Five," "Cat's Cradle," "Breakfast of Champions," and "Player Piano." 

Now, the key here is the publication date: March 31, 1969. I need to check which of his books came out around that time. Let me think. "Slaughterhouse-Five" was published in 1969. Wait, was it March? I'm not entirely sure. I remember that "Slaughterhouse-Five" is one of his most famous works, dealing with the bombing of Dresden during World War II. The author himself was a survivor of that event, which might be why he wrote it. 

Let me cross-verify the dates. If I recall correctly, "Slaughterhouse-Five" was published in 1969, but I need to confirm the exact month. I think it was released in April, but the user specified March 31. Maybe there's a difference in publication dates between different regions or the exact release day. Alternatively, maybe it was published in March. 

Another possibility is "Cat's Cradle," which came out in 1963. "Breakfast of Champions" was 1973. "Player Piano" is from 1952. So the only one that fits the 1969 timeframe is "Slaughterhouse-Five." Let me check if the exact date is March 31. I might be mixing up the dates with other books. 

I can also think of the structure of the book. "Slaughterhouse-Five" is known for its non-linear narrative and the concept of "so it goes," which is a recurring phrase. The protagonist is Billy Pilgrim, who becomes "unstuck in time." The book was indeed published in 1969. Now, to confirm the exact date. A quick search in my memory: I think the initial publication was in April 1969. But the user says March 31. Maybe the book was announced or had a different release date in some regions? Or perhaps the user is using a different source. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another book by Vonnegut from that exact date. Let me think. Are there any other books? "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater" was 1965. "Jailbird" was 1979. "Hocus Pocus" was 1991. So no, the only one in 1969 is "Slaughterhouse-Five." Therefore, even if the exact date is April, the user might have specified March 31, but the correct answer is "Slaughterhouse-Five." I'll go with that.
