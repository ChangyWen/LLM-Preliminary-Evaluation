Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on October 21, 1977, created by Katherine Paterson. Hmm, I need to recall her works. Katherine Paterson is a well-known author, and she has written several notable books. One of her most famous works is "Bridge to Terabithia," but I think that was published in 1977. Wait, the date given is October 21, 1977. Let me check the publication dates.

"Bridge to Terabithia" was indeed published in 1977. The exact date might be October 21. Let me confirm. Yes, I believe that's correct. The book is a classic children's novel that won the Newbery Medal. It's about two children who create a magical kingdom in the woods. The user is asking for the name, so the answer should be "Bridge to Terabithia." I need to make sure there's no other book by her from that exact date. I don't recall another major book by her in 1977. So the answer is likely that one.
