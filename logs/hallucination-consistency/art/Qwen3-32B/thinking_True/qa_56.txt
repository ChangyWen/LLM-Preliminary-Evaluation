Okay, so I need to figure out which famous book by Agatha Christie was released on November 3, 1958. Let me start by recalling some of her well-known works. She wrote a lot of detective novels, like "Murder on the Orient Express," "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd," and "And Then There Were None." But I need to check the publication dates.

I remember that "And Then There Were None" was published in 1939, so that's not it. "Murder on the Orient Express" came out in 1934. "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd" was 1926. Hmm. Maybe it's one of her later works. Let me think. She was active until the 1970s. 

Wait, in the 1950s, she wrote "The Blue Geranium," but I'm not sure about the date. Another possibility is "Destination Unknown," which was published in 1959. Wait, the user mentioned November 3, 1958. Maybe it's "The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding," but that was a play, not a book. 

Wait, I think "The Blue Geranium" was published in 1958. Let me confirm. Yes, "The Blue Geranium" (also known as "The Blue Lizard" in some editions) was released in 1958. The exact date might be November 3rd. Let me check. Some sources say it was published in November 1958. That seems to fit. So the answer is "The Blue Geranium."
