Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book by Isaac Asimov that was released on December 2, 1950. Hmm, I need to recall Asimov's works from around that time. I know he wrote a lot of science fiction, especially the Foundation series and the Robot series.

Wait, the Foundation series started with "Foundation," which I think was published in 1951. But the user mentioned 1950. Maybe it's a different book. Let me check. Oh, right! The first book in the Robot series is "I, Robot," which was a collection of short stories. When was that published? I believe "I, Robot" was released in 1950. Let me confirm the exact date. Yes, December 2, 1950, is the publication date. So the answer should be "I, Robot" by Isaac Asimov. I should make sure there aren't any other books by him from that exact date. I don't think so. The Foundation series started later, and "I, Robot" is the one from 1950. Yeah, that's the one.
