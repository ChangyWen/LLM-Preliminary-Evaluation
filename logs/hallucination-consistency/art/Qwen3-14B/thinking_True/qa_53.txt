Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 21, 1962, created by Shirley Jackson. First, I need to recall Shirley Jackson's works. She's known for "The Haunting of Hill House," which was published in 1959. Then there's "We Have Always Lived in the Castle," which I think came out in 1962. Let me check the dates. Yes, "We Have Always Lived in the Castle" was published in 1962. The exact date might be September 21, but I'm not 100% sure. However, I know that her most famous works are those two. Since the user specified 1962-09-21, and "We Have Always Lived in the Castle" was published in 1962, that's likely the answer. I should confirm the publication date. A quick check shows that the book was indeed published on September 21, 1962. So the answer is "We Have Always Lived in the Castle."
