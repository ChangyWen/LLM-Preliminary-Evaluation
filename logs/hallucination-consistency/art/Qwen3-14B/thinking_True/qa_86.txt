Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on October 10, 2000, created by Philip Pullman. First, I need to recall Philip Pullman's works. He's known for "His Dark Materials," which is a trilogy. The first book in that series is "Northern Lights," published in 1995. The second book is "The Subtle Knife," which I think came out in 1997. The third one is "The Amber Spyglass," released in 2000. Wait, the user mentioned the release date as October 10, 2000. Let me check the exact publication date of "The Amber Spyglass." I remember that the third book was published in 2000, but I'm not sure about the exact date. However, the user specified October 10th. Maybe that's the date it was released in the UK? Alternatively, could there be another book by Pullman from that date? I don't recall any other major works by him around that time. "His Dark Materials" is his most famous series, so it's likely the answer they're looking for. The third book in the trilogy was indeed published in 2000, and if the date is October 10, that might be the specific release date. I should confirm that "The Amber Spyglass" was published on that exact date. If I can't find that exact date, maybe the user is referring to the trilogy as a whole, but the question specifies a single book. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the date, but given the information, "The Amber Spyglass" is the most probable answer.
