Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 5, 1957, created by Jack Kerouac. I know Jack Kerouac is one of the key figures of the Beat Generation. His most famous work is "On the Road," which I believe was published in 1957. But wait, I need to confirm the exact date. I remember that "On the Road" was first published in 1957, but I'm not sure if it was September 5th. Let me think. I think the initial publication date might have been July 1957, but maybe there was a different edition or a reissue on September 5th? Or perhaps the user is referring to a different book. Alternatively, maybe it's a different date. Wait, I should check my facts. Jack Kerouac wrote "On the Road" which was published by Viking Press. The first edition was released on July 18, 1957. However, maybe the user is referring to a later publication date or a different book. But I don't recall another major book by Kerouac from that exact date. It's possible that the user might have the date slightly off, but the most famous book by Kerouac is definitely "On the Road." So even if the date isn't exact, the answer is likely "On the Road." I should confirm the publication date again. A quick check in my memory: yes, the first publication was July 1957, but maybe the user is referring to a different edition or a different date. However, given the information, "On the Road" is the correct answer.
