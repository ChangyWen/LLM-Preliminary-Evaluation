Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on July 22, 1997, created by Philip Pullman. First, I need to recall Philip Pullman's works. He's known for "His Dark Materials," which is a trilogy. The first book in that series is "Northern Lights," which was published in 1995 in the UK and 1997 in the US. Wait, the user mentioned the release date as 1997-07-22. Let me check the exact publication dates.

"Northern Lights" was published in the UK on October 19, 1995, and in the US on July 22, 1997. So the US release date matches the date the user provided. The book is part of the "His Dark Materials" trilogy. The other books are "The Subtle Knife" and "The Amber Spyglass." Since the user is asking for the name of the book, the answer should be "Northern Lights." I should confirm that there aren't any other books by Philip Pullman published on that exact date. I don't think so. So the answer is "Northern Lights."
