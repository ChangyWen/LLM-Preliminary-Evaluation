Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 19, 2012, created by Joël Dicker. First, I need to recall if I know any books by Joël Dicker. I remember that he's a Swiss author, and one of his well-known works is "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair." Wait, but when was that published? Let me check my memory. I think that book was published in 2010, maybe in French first, then translated into English. But the user is asking about 2012. Hmm.

Wait, maybe there's another book by him. Let me think. Joël Dicker has written several books, including "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair," "The Last Days of a Crime," and "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair" is part of a series. But the release date for the first book was 2010. Maybe the user is referring to a different book. Alternatively, could there be a translation or a sequel released in 2012? Or perhaps the user is mistaken about the date?

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair" but the date is different. Let me verify. A quick search in my mind: the original French version was published in 2010, and the English translation came out in 2012. So if the user is referring to the English release date, then September 19, 2012, might be the date when the English version was published. That could be the book they're asking about. So the answer would be "The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair" by Joël Dicker, released in 2012 in English. I think that's the one.
