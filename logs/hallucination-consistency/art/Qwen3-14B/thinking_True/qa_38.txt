Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 22, 2007, created by Khaled Hosseini. I know Khaled Hosseini is a well-known author, especially for his novels set in Afghanistan. His most famous works are "The Kite Runner" and "A Thousand Splendid Suns." 

Wait, "The Kite Runner" was published in 2003, right? So that's before 2007. Then "A Thousand Splendid Suns" came out later. Let me check the publication date of that one. I think "A Thousand Splendid Suns" was released in 2007. Let me confirm the exact date. If the user mentioned May 22, 2007, that's probably the release date for "A Thousand Splendid Suns." 

I should make sure there aren't any other books by Hosseini around that time. He also wrote "And the Mountains Echoed," but that was published in 2013. So the answer should be "A Thousand Splendid Suns." Let me double-check the publication date to be certain. Yes, according to my knowledge, "A Thousand Splendid Suns" was indeed published on May 22, 2007. That matches the user's query.
