Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on January 28, 2014, created by Pierce Brown. First, I need to recall Pierce Brown's works. He's an author known for his sci-fi novels. His most famous work is probably "Red Rising," which is part of the Red Rising series.

Now, checking the release date. "Red Rising" was published in 2014. Let me confirm the exact date. I think it came out in January 2014. A quick check in my memory: yes, January 28, 2014, is the release date for "Red Rising." That's the first book in the series. The user might be referring to that. I don't recall any other major books by Pierce Brown around that time. So the answer should be "Red Rising."
