Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 15, 2014, created by Jenny Han. First, I need to recall Jenny Han's works. She's known for the "Summer" series, which includes "The Summer I Turned Pretty," "We Were Liars," and others. Wait, but "We Were Liars" was published in 2014. Let me check the publication date. I think "We Were Liars" came out in April 2014. That matches the date given. So the answer is probably "We Were Liars." I should confirm the exact release date to be sure. Yes, April 15, 2014, is correct for that book. Jenny Han is the author, and it's a well-known young adult novel. I don't think there's another major book by her around that time. So the answer should be "We Were Liars."
