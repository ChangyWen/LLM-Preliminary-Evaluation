Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on July 29, 1954, created by J.R.R. Tolkien. First, I need to recall Tolkien's major works. His most well-known book is "The Lord of the Rings," but I think that was published in 1954-1955. Wait, the exact release date might be important here.

I remember that "The Lord of the Rings" was published in three volumes: The Fellowship of the Ring in 1954, The Two Towers in 1954 as well, and The Return of the King in 1955. But the user specified July 29, 1954. Let me check the publication dates. The first volume, "The Fellowship of the Ring," was indeed published on July 29, 1954. So that's the one. The other books in the series came out later. The user might be referring to the first part of the trilogy. Alternatively, could there be another book by Tolkien from that date? I don't think so. His other major work is "The Hobbit," which was published in 1937. So the answer should be "The Fellowship of the Ring."
