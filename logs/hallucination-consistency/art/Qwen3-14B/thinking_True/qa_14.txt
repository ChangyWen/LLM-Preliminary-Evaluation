Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 2, 2017, created by Jenny Han. First, I need to recall Jenny Han's works. She's known for the "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" series. The first book in that series was released in 2017. Let me check the exact release date. I think the first book came out in May 2017. The title is "To All the Boys I've Loved Before." I should confirm the date to be sure. Yes, the publication date for the first book in the series is indeed May 2, 2017. So that's the answer.
