Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on August 6, 2010, created by Emma Donoghue. First, I need to recall Emma Donoghue's works. She's an Irish author known for several novels. One of her most famous books is "Room," which I think was published around that time.

Wait, when was "Room" published? Let me check my memory. I believe "Room" was released in 2010. The exact date might be August 6th. Let me confirm. Yes, I remember that "Room" was published on August 6, 2010. It's a novel that tells the story of a mother and her son who are held captive in a small room. The book received a lot of acclaim and was even adapted into a film. 

I don't think Emma Donoghue has another book that's as famous as "Room" from that year. Other works of hers include "The Wonder" and "Akin," but those were published later. So the answer should be "Room."
