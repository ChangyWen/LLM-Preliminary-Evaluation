Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on January 17, 1964, created by Roald Dahl. First, I need to recall Roald Dahl's bibliography and the publication dates of his works.

Roald Dahl wrote several well-known books like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The BFG, James and the Giant Peach, etc. Now, I need to check when each of these was published. 

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was first published in 1964. Let me confirm the exact date. I think it was released in the UK in 1964, but I'm not sure about the exact day. However, the user specified January 17, 1964. I should check if that's the correct date for the book's release.

Looking up, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (originally titled Charlie Bucket and the Chocolate Factory) was published on September 29, 1964, in the UK. Wait, that's not January 17. Hmm, maybe the user has a different source or there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a different book. Let me think again.

Another possibility is that the user might have confused the date. Roald Dahl's other books: The Witches was published in 1983, The BFG in 1982, Matilda in 1988. James and the Giant Peach was 1968. So none of those match 1964. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to the original publication date in another country? Or perhaps a different edition? But the main publication date for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is 1964. However, the exact date might not be January 17. Maybe the user is mistaken about the date, but the book in question is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Alternatively, could there be another book?

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of a different author, but the question specifically says Roald Dahl. Let me check again. If the user says 1964-01-17, but the actual publication date is September 1964, perhaps there's a discrepancy. However, given that the user is asking for the book by Roald Dahl from that date, the most likely answer is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, even if the exact date might not be January 17. Maybe the user has a specific edition or a different source. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the US publication date, which might be different. Let me check the US publication date. The US edition was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1964, but again, the exact date isn't January 17. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is incorrect about the date, but the answer they expect is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Since that's the only major book by Dahl from 1964, I think that's the intended answer here. So despite the date discrepancy, the answer is likely Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
