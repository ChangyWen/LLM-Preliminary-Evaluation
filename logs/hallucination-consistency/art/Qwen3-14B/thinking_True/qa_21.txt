Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 19, 1952, created by John Steinbeck. First, I need to recall John Steinbeck's major works. His most well-known books include "The Grapes of Wrath," "East of Eden," "Of Mice and Men," and "Cannery Row." 

Now, checking the publication dates. "The Grapes of Wrath" was published in 1939. "East of Eden" came out in 1952. Wait, the user mentioned September 19, 1952. Let me confirm the exact publication date of "East of Eden." I think it was indeed published in 1952, but I need to check if it was September 19. 

Looking up, "East of Eden" was first published on September 19, 1952. That matches the date the user provided. So the answer should be "East of Eden." I should make sure there's no other book by Steinbeck from that date, but I don't recall any others. So the final answer is East of Eden.
