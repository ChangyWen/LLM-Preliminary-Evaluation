Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on January 12, 2016, created by Paul Kalanithi. First, I need to recall who Paul Kalanithi is. He was a neurosurgeon and author, right? I remember he wrote a book about his experiences with terminal illness. The title might be something like "When Breath Becomes Air." Wait, was that the one? Let me check the publication date. I think that book was published in 2016. But I need to confirm the exact date. Some sources say it was released on January 12, 2016. Yes, that seems right. So the answer should be "When Breath Becomes Air." I should make sure there's no other book by him published around that time, but I don't recall any others. Yeah, that's the one.
