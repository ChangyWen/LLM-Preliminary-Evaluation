Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on December 2, 1950, created by Isaac Asimov. First, I need to recall Isaac Asimov's bibliography. He's a well-known science fiction author, famous for works like the Foundation series and the Robot series.

Now, the date is December 2, 1950. I remember that "Foundation" was published in 1951, so that's probably not it. What about "I, Robot"? Let me think. "I, Robot" was first published as a collection of short stories, but the book was released in 1950. Wait, the original stories were published in magazines over the years, and the book was compiled. The first edition of "I, Robot" was published by Gnome Press in 1950. The exact date might be December 2, 1950. That seems to fit. Let me check if there's another book by Asimov from that date. I don't recall another major work from that specific date. So the answer is likely "I, Robot."
