Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on January 13, 1996, created by Jon Krakauer. I need to recall Jon Krakauer's works and their publication dates.

First, I know Jon Krakauer is an author known for non-fiction, especially true crime and adventure stories. His most famous book is "Into the Wild," which I think was published in 1996. Let me check the publication date. Wait, I remember that "Into the Wild" was released in 1996, but I need to confirm the exact date. The user specified January 13, 1996. 

I should verify if that's correct. A quick search in my memory: "Into the Wild" was published by Doubleday. The release date is indeed January 13, 1996. Yes, that's right. Other books by Krakauer include "Into Thin Air," but that was published later, in 1997. So the answer should be "Into the Wild."
