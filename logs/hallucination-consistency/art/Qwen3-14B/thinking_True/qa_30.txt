Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book by Robert A. Heinlein that was released on November 5, 1959. First, I need to recall Heinlein's bibliography and check the publication dates.

Robert A. Heinlein is a well-known science fiction author, and some of his most famous works include "Stranger in a Strange Land," "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress," and "Starship Troopers." I remember that "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" was published in 1966, so that's not it. "Starship Troopers" came out in 1959, but I need to confirm the exact date. Wait, the user specified November 5, 1959. Let me check the publication date of "Starship Troopers." 

Looking it up, "Starship Troopers" was indeed published in 1959. However, the exact date might be important here. Some sources say it was released in November 1959, but I need to verify if it was specifically November 5th. Alternatively, maybe there's another book by Heinlein from that date. 

Another possibility is "The Door into Summer," which was published in 1957, so that's too early. "Stranger in a Strange Land" was 1961. "Time Enough for Love" was 1973. Hmm. Wait, "Starship Troopers" was first published by Doubleday in 1959. The exact date might be November 5, 1959. Let me check a reliable source. 

According to the Library of Congress and other bibliographies, "Starship Troopers" by Robert A. Heinlein was published on November 5, 1959. That matches the date the user provided. So the answer should be "Starship Troopers."
