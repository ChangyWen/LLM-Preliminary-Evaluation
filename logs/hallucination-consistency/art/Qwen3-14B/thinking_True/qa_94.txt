Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on November 30, 1955, created by Patricia Highsmith. First, I need to recall Patricia Highsmith's works. She's known for her psychological thrillers. Her most famous work is "The Talented Mr. Ripley," but I think that was published later, maybe in the 1950s? Wait, no, I remember that "The Talented Mr. Ripley" was first published in 1959. So that's not it.

Wait, the user mentioned 1955. Let me think. Another book by Highsmith is "Strangers on a Train," but that was published in 1950. Hmm. What about "The Price of Salt"? No, that was published in 1952. Wait, maybe "The Blunderer"? No, that's from 1954. Let me check my memory again. Oh, wait! "The Talented Mr. Ripley" was actually first published in 1959, but there's a possibility of a different book. Wait, maybe "The Cry of the Owl" was published in 1955? Let me confirm. Alternatively, could it be "The Mysterious Stranger"? No, that's not by Highsmith. 

Wait, I think I might be mixing up the dates. Let me think again. Patricia Highsmith's first novel was "The Town and the City," published in 1950. Then "Strangers on a Train" in 1951. "The Talented Mr. Ripley" came later. Wait, maybe "The Black House" was published in 1955? No, I think that's from 1955. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall the exact publication dates. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "The Talented Mr. Ripley" but the date is incorrect. However, the user specified 1955-11-30. Let me check if there's a book by Highsmith published on that exact date. If I can't recall, maybe I should consider that the user might have the date wrong, but the question is about the book. Alternatively, perhaps "The Talented Mr. Ripley" was first published in 1959, but maybe there was a different book in 1955. 

Wait, I think "The Talented Mr. Ripley" was first published in 1959, but Highsmith wrote it earlier. However, the user's date is 1955. Let me check another angle. Maybe "The Price of Salt" was published in 1952, but that's not 1955. "The Blunderer" was 1954. "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is 1959. Wait, maybe "The Cry of the Owl" was 1955? Let me confirm. 

After checking my memory, I think "The Talented Mr. Ripley" was indeed published in 1959, so that's not the one. Then, perhaps the user is mistaken about the date, but the question is about the book. Alternatively, maybe "The Black House" was published in 1955. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "The Talented Mr. Ripley" but the date is wrong. However, the user is asking for the book released on that specific date. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of "The Talented Mr. Ripley" but the date is incorrect. However, I need to be accurate. If I can't recall a book by Highsmith from 1955, perhaps the answer is that there's no such book, but that's unlikely. Wait, I think "The Talented Mr. Ripley" was first published in 1959, but maybe there was a different book. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "The Price of Salt" but that's 1952. 

Wait, I think I need to check the exact publication dates. Let me try to recall. Patricia Highsmith's works: 

- The Town and the City (1950)
- Strangers on a Train (1951)
- The Price of Salt (1952)
- The Blunderer (1954)
- The Talented Mr. Ripley (1959)
- The Cry of the Owl (1962)
- The Mysterious Stranger (1963)
- The Boy Who Followed the Spider (1965)
- The Mirror of the Sea (1966)
- The Tremor of the Earth (1967)
- The Distant Shore (1969)
- The Two Faces of January (1973)
- The Good Thief (1989)

Wait, so between 1950 and 1959, the books are up to The Blunderer in 1954. Then The Talented Mr. Ripley in 1959. So there's a gap between 1954 and 1959. Therefore, there's no book by Highsmith published in 1955. But the user is asking for a book released on 1955-11-30. That might be a mistake. However, maybe the user is referring to a different book. Alternatively, perhaps the user is thinking of "The Talented Mr. Ripley" but the date is wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different author, but the question says Patricia Highsmith. If there's no book by her in 1955, then the answer would be that there's no such book. But that's unlikely. Wait, maybe "The Black House" was published in 1955? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken about the date. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to "The Talented Mr. Ripley" but the date is incorrect. However, the user is asking for the book released on that specific date. If I can't find a book by Highsmith from that date, then the answer might be that there's no such book. But I need to be careful. 

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check again. Patricia Highsmith's "The Talented Mr. Ripley" was first published in 1959, but she started writing it in the 1950s. However, the publication date is 1959. So if the user is asking for 1955, then there's no book by her from that year. Therefore, the answer might be that there's no such book. But the user is asking for a famous book, so maybe they have the date wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different book. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of "The Price of Salt" but that's 1952. I'm not sure. Given that, perhaps the answer is that there's no book by Patricia Highsmith published on November 30, 1955. However, the user might have the date wrong. But since the question is specific, I need to answer based on the information. 

Wait, I think I need to check if there's any book by Highsmith in 1955. Let me think again. Her works between 1950 and 1959: The Town and the City (1950), Strangers on a Train (1951), The Price of Salt (1952), The Blunderer (1954), then The Talented Mr. Ripley in 1959. So no book in 1955. Therefore, the answer is that there is no such book. But the user is asking for a famous book, so maybe they made a mistake in the date. However, the user might be referring to "The Talented Mr. Ripley" but the date is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different book. But I can't think of any. Therefore, the answer is that there is no famous book by Patricia Highsmith published on November 30, 1955. However, the user might have the date wrong. But since the question is specific, I need to answer accordingly.
