Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 13, 2007, created by Dominick Dunne. First, I need to recall who Dominick Dunne is. He was a journalist and author known for his work in true crime and legal issues. I remember he wrote several books, especially about high-profile cases.

Now, the date is September 13, 2007. I need to check if there's a book by him published around that time. Let me think. One of his well-known books is "An Inconvenient Truth," but wait, that's by Al Gore. No, that's not it. Another possibility is "The New York Times" articles he wrote, but he also had a book called "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles" which was a novel, but I'm not sure about the date.

Wait, Dominick Dunne wrote a book titled "The Short Life and Curious Death of the Honorable Henry Wadsworth Longfellow" but that seems like a joke title. Maybe not. Alternatively, he wrote "The Killer Inside Me," but that's by a different author. Hmm.

Wait, I think he wrote a book called "The Perfect Crime" or something similar. Let me check my memory. Oh, right! He wrote a book called "The New York Times" bestseller "The Killer Inside Me" but that's by Pete Dexter. No, that's not him. Maybe "The Death of a Salesman" but that's Arthur Miller's play.

Wait, perhaps "The Unwoman" or "The Woman in the Window." No, those are other authors. Maybe I should think about his non-fiction works. He wrote about the case of the murder of his daughter, which was covered in his book "The Short Life and Curious Death of the Honorable Henry Wadsworth Longfellow" but that's a fictional title. Wait, no, that's not right.

Alternatively, he wrote "The New York Times" article about the murder of his daughter, which was later compiled into a book. The book might be called "The Short Life and Curious Death of the Honorable Henry Wadsworth Longfellow" but that's a joke. Wait, maybe "The Death of a Salesman" is not it. 

Wait, I think the correct answer is "The New York Times" bestseller "The Killer Inside Me" but that's not by Dunne. Maybe I'm mixing up authors. Let me try to recall. Dominick Dunne's book "The New York Times" bestseller was "The Death of a Salesman" but that's not correct. 

Alternatively, he wrote a book called "The Perfect Crime" which was published in 2007. Let me check the date. If I can't remember, maybe I should look up the publication dates of his books. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory.
