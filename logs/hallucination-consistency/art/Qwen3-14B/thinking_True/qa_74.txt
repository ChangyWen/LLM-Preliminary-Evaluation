Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 13, 1953, created by Ian Fleming. Hmm, I know Ian Fleming is the author of the James Bond series. The first James Bond novel was "Casino Royale," right? But wait, when was that published? Let me think. I remember that "Casino Royale" was the first in the series, but I'm not sure about the exact date. Wait, the user specified April 13, 1953. Let me check my memory. I think "Casino Royale" was published in 1953, but maybe the exact date is different. Alternatively, maybe it's "Live and Let Die," but that was later. Wait, no, "Casino Royale" was the first, and I believe it was released in 1953. Let me confirm. Yes, "Casino Royale" by Ian Fleming was published on April 13, 1953. That's the one. So the answer should be "Casino Royale."
