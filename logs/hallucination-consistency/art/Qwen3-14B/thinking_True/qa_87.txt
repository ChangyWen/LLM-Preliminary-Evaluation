Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 6, 2004, created by Jodi Picoult. First, I need to recall Jodi Picoult's bibliography. She's a well-known author, especially for her novels that deal with complex social issues.

I remember that "The Pact" is one of her books, but I think that was published earlier, maybe around 2001. Then there's "The Tenth Circle," which I believe came out in 2006. Wait, the user specified 2004-04-06. Let me check my memory again.

Another one is "My Sister's Keeper," which I think was published in 2004. Let me confirm the publication date. Yes, "My Sister's Keeper" was released on April 6, 2004. That matches the date the user provided. Jodi Picoult is the author, and it's a well-known book that was later adapted into a movie. I think that's the one they're looking for.
