Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 29, 2003, created by Khaled Hosseini. I know Khaled Hosseini is a well-known author, especially for his novels set in Afghanistan. His most famous works include "The Kite Runner" and "A Thousand Splendid Suns." 

Wait, "The Kite Runner" was published in 2003. Let me check the exact date. I think it was released in May 2003. The user specified May 29, 2003. I should confirm if that's the correct release date for "The Kite Runner." 

I recall that "The Kite Runner" was published by Riverhead Books, and the release date was indeed May 29, 2003. "A Thousand Splendid Suns" came out later, in 2007. So the answer should be "The Kite Runner." I need to make sure there's no other book by him released on that date, but I don't think so. That's his most famous one from that time.
