Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 23, 2017, created by Kevin Kwan. First, I need to recall Kevin Kwan's works. He's known for the "Crazy Rich Asians" series. The first book in that series was "Crazy Rich Asians," which was published in 2013. Then there's the sequel, "China Rich Girlfriend," released in 2015. The third book in the series is "Rich People Problems," which came out in 2017. Let me check the exact release date of "Rich People Problems." I think it was May 2017, but I need to confirm the specific date. If the user mentioned May 23, 2017, that's likely the release date for "Rich People Problems." I should verify that. Yes, according to my knowledge, "Rich People Problems" was published on May 23, 2017. So the answer should be that book.
