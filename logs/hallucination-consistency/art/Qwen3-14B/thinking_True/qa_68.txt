Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 14, 2003, created by Lionel Shriver. First, I need to recall Lionel Shriver's works. She's a well-known author, and one of her most famous books is "The Postman Always Rings Twice," which is a modern retelling of the classic noir story. But wait, when was that published? Let me check my memory. I think "The Postman Always Rings Twice" was published in 2003. Let me confirm the date. If the user specified April 14, 2003, that's the exact release date. I should also consider if there are other books by her around that time. She wrote "So I Am Glad" in 2002, and "The Mandibles: A Family, 2029â€“2047" came out later, in 2016. So the most likely answer is "The Postman Always Rings Twice." I need to make sure the date matches. Yes, I believe that's correct. The user might be looking for that title.
