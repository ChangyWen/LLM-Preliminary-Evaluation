Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on October 10, 2013, created by Greg Sestero. Hmm, I remember that Greg Sestero is known for co-writing a book with another person. Wait, wasn't there a book about a movie that was a cult classic? Oh right, "The Disaster Artist"! That's the one. But wait, was that the title? Let me think. The book was written by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell. It's about the making of the movie "The Room," which is often considered one of the worst movies ever made. The book was published in 2013, and the release date might be October 10th. I should check the exact date, but I'm pretty sure that's the book they're referring to. The user might be thinking of the movie adaptation that came later, but the book itself was released in 2013. Yeah, I think that's the answer.
