Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 12, 1969, created by Michael Crichton. Hmm, I need to recall Michael Crichton's works and their publication dates.

First, I know that Michael Crichton is famous for "Jurassic Park," but that was published in 1990, right? So that's not it. Then there's "The Andromeda Strain," which I think came out in 1969. Let me check the dates. Wait, the user specified May 12, 1969. I remember that "The Andromeda Strain" was indeed published in 1969, but I need to confirm the exact date. 

Looking it up in my memory, the book was released in May 1969. The exact date might be May 12th. Crichton wrote it, and it's one of his earlier works. Other books like "Sphere" were later, in the 90s. So the answer is likely "The Andromeda Strain." I should make sure there's no other book by him from that date, but I don't recall any others from 1969. Yeah, I think that's the one.
