Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 15, 1977, created by J.R.R. Tolkien. Hmm, first, I need to recall when Tolkien's major works were published. His most famous book is "The Lord of the Rings," but I think that was published earlier. Let me check the dates.

Wait, "The Lord of the Rings" was published in 1954-1955, right? So that's way before 1977. Then what else did Tolkien write? He also wrote "The Hobbit," which came out in 1937. But the user is asking about 1977. Maybe there's a posthumous publication?

J.R.R. Tolkien died in 1973, so any books published after that would be posthumous. I remember that "The Silmarillion" was published in 1977. Let me confirm the date. Yes, "The Silmarillion" was released on September 15, 1977, by Allen & Unwin. It was edited by his son Christopher Tolkien. So that's the book they're referring to. The user might be confused because it's a later work, but it's definitely by Tolkien, just published after his death. I should make sure there aren't any other books from that exact date, but I think "The Silmarillion" is the correct answer here.
