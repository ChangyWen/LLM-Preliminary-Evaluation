Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on January 1, 2008, created by Garth Stein. First, I need to recall Garth Stein's works. He's an American author, and one of his most well-known books is "The Art of Racing in the Rain." I think that was published around 2008. Let me check the publication date. Yes, "The Art of Racing in the Rain" was released on January 1, 2008. The book is written from the perspective of a dog named Enzo, which is quite unique. It's a novel that blends elements of drama and life lessons. I don't think Garth Stein has any other books that are as famous as this one. The user might be looking for this title. I should confirm the date again to be sure. Yep, the release date matches. So the answer should be "The Art of Racing in the Rain."
