Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on October 18, 2007, created by Jay Asher. Hmm, I need to recall if there's a well-known book by that author with that publication date.

First, I remember that Jay Asher is the author of "Thirteen Reasons Why." That book was a big deal, especially with the later TV adaptation. Now, when was that book published? I think it came out around 2007. Let me check my memory. Yes, I believe "Thirteen Reasons Why" was released in October 2007. The exact date might be October 18th. I should confirm that. 

Wait, I might be mixing up the dates with other books. Let me think. The book was a debut novel, and it gained a lot of attention for its unique format with the audio tapes. The release date being October 18, 2007, seems right. I don't recall any other major books by Jay Asher around that time. So, the answer is likely "Thirteen Reasons Why."
