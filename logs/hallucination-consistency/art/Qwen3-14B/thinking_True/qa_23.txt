Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on March 7, 2000, created by Mark Z. Danielewski. Hmm, I remember that Mark Z. Danielewski is a writer known for his unique and complex books. One of his most famous works is "House of Leaves." Let me check the publication date of that book.

I think "House of Leaves" was published in 2000. The exact date might be March 7th. I should confirm that. A quick search in my memory: yes, the book was released on March 7, 2000. It's a novel that's known for its intricate structure, footnotes, and multiple narratives. The author's full name is Mark Z. Danielewski, and the book is definitely his most well-known work. I don't think he has any other books published around that time that are as famous. So the answer should be "House of Leaves."
