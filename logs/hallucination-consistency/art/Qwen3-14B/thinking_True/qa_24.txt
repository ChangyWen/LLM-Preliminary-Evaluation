Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 19, 2020, created by Suzanne Collins. First, I need to recall Suzanne Collins' works. She's best known for "The Hunger Games" series, which includes "The Hunger Games," "Catching Fire," and "Mockingjay." Those books were published in 2008, 2009, and 2010 respectively.

Now, the user is asking about a book from 2020. I don't remember Suzanne Collins publishing a new book in that year. Let me think. There was a movie adaptation of "The Hunger Games" called "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay â€“ Part 2" released in 2015, but that's a film, not a book. 

Wait, maybe there's a companion book or a new series? I don't recall any new books by her in 2020. Perhaps the user is confused with the release date of a movie or another author? Alternatively, maybe it's a book that was released in 2020 but not by Collins. Let me check my memory again. 

Suzanne Collins has also written "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes," which is a prequel to "The Hunger Games." That book was released in 2020. Let me confirm the date. Yes, "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" was published on October 13, 2020, not May 19. So that's not the one. 

Wait, the user specified May 19, 2020. Maybe there's another book? I don't think so. Perhaps the user is mistaken about the date or the author. Alternatively, maybe it's a different work. But I can't think of any other books by Suzanne Collins from that date. 

So, the answer is that there's no famous book by Suzanne Collins released on May 19, 2020. The closest is "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" in October 2020. Therefore, the user might have the date wrong or confused with another author.
