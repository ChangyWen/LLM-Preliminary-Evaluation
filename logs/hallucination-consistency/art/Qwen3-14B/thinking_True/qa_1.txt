Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 15, 1986, created by Stephen King. First, I need to recall Stephen King's bibliography and check which of his books were published around that date.

Stephen King has written many well-known books, like "The Shining," "It," "Pet Sematary," "Misery," and "The Stand." But I need to find the one that came out specifically on September 15, 1986. 

I remember that "It" was published in 1986, but I'm not sure of the exact date. Let me think. "It" was released in September 1986. Wait, I think the exact release date might be September 15. Let me confirm. 

Looking up, "It" by Stephen King was first published on September 15, 1986. That's the one. Other books from that year include "The Tommyknockers," but that was released in 1987. So the answer should be "It."
