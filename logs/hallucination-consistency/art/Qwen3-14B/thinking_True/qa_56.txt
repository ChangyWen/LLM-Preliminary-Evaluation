Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book by Agatha Christie that was released on November 3, 1958. First, I need to recall Agatha Christie's bibliography and check which of her books were published around that date.

Agatha Christie is known for her detective novels, and some of her most famous works include "Murder on the Orient Express" and "And Then There Were None." However, those were published earlier. Let me think about her later works. 

I remember that "The Mousetrap" is her most famous play, but the user is asking for a book, not a play. So that's probably not it. 

Looking up her publication dates, "The ABC Murders" was published in 1935, which is too early. "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd" is from 1926. 

Wait, maybe "The Clocks" or "The Hollow"? Let me check. "The Hollow" was published in 1946. Hmm. 

Wait, I think "The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding" was published in 1960, which is after 1958. What about "The Mirror Crack'd"? That was 1975. 

Wait, maybe "The Thirteen Problems" was published in 1932. Not that date. 

Wait, perhaps "The Witness for the Prosecution" was a play, but the book version was published in 1943. 

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. Agatha Christie's works from the late 1950s. Maybe "The Labours of Hercules"? That was published in 1947. 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall if there's a book that's specifically associated with 1958. 

Oh! "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd" was a 1926 novel, but maybe a reissue? No, the user is asking for the original release date. 

Wait, I think "The Clocks" was published in 1957. Then "The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding" in 1960. So between 1957 and 1960, maybe "The Mirror Crack'd" is 1975. 

Wait, perhaps "The Mystery of the Blue Geranium" was published in 1953. 

Wait, I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should check if there's a book that was released on November 3, 1958. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "The Mousetrap," but that's a play. 

Wait, I think "The ABC Murders" was 1935, "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd" 1926, "And Then There Were None" 1939. 

Wait, maybe "The Hollow" was 1946. 

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think of Agatha Christie's works in the 1950s. 

In 1950, she published "The Blue Geranium." In 1952, "The Hollow." In 1953, "The Mystery of the Blue Geranium." In 1954, "The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding." In 1955, "The Clocks." In 1956, "The Mirror Crack'd." In 1957, "The Labours of Hercules." In 1958, maybe "The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding" was reissued? Or perhaps "The Mousetrap" was published as a book in 1952, but the play was first performed in 1952. 

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe the user is mistaken about the date, but assuming the date is correct, perhaps "The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding" was published in 1960, so not 1958. 

Alternatively, maybe "The Thirteen Problems" was published in 1932, but that's not 1958. 

Wait, I think I need to check if there's a book by Agatha Christie published on November 3, 1958. If I can't recall, maybe the answer is that there's no such book, but the user is probably referring to a well-known one. 

Wait, perhaps "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd" was reprinted in 1958, but the original was 1926. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "The Mousetrap" as a book, but that was first published as a play in 1952. 

Wait, I'm not finding a match. Maybe the user made a mistake in the date. However, if I have to give an answer, perhaps the closest is "The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding," but that's 1960. 

Alternatively, maybe "The Clocks" was published in 1957, and "The Mirror Crack'd" in 1975. 

Wait, I think I need to conclude that there's no Agatha Christie book published on November 3, 1958, but the user might be referring to "The Mousetrap" or another work. However, since the user insists on a book, maybe the answer is "The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding," but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user is mistaken, but I need to provide the best possible answer based on available knowledge.
