Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 11, 2001, created by Yann Martel. First, I need to recall Yann Martel's works. He's a Canadian author, right? His most famous book is "Life of Pi," which I think was published around 2001. Wait, but the date given here is September 11, 2001. Let me check the publication date of "Life of Pi." I remember that the book was published in 2001, but I'm not sure about the exact date. However, September 11th is a significant date, and the book was released around that time. But I should confirm if the release date was indeed September 11, 2001. Alternatively, maybe the user is conflating the release date with the 9/11 attacks, but the book was published before that date. Wait, no, "Life of Pi" was published in 2001, but the exact date might be different. Let me think. I think it was published in Canada in 2001, and then in the US later. The exact date might be September 11, 2001, but I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken about the date. However, the question specifically states the release date as 2001-09-11. If that's the case, then "Life of Pi" is the answer. But I should double-check. Let me recall: Yann Martel wrote "Life of Pi," which was published in 2001. The exact publication date in Canada was September 11, 2001. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is "Life of Pi."
