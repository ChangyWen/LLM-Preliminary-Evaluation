Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on October 21, 1992, created by Madonna. Hmm, first, I need to recall if Madonna has written any books. I know she's a singer, so maybe she wrote an autobiography or something related to her career.

Wait, I remember that Madonna wrote a book called "Truth or Dare: The Confessions of Madonna." Let me check the publication date. If I'm not mistaken, that book was released in 1992. But I need to confirm the exact date. October 21st... I think that's correct. Let me think if there are any other books by her. There's also "The English Roses," but that's a novel she co-wrote with her daughter, Lourdes, and that was published later, around 2003. So the 1992 one is "Truth or Dare." Yeah, that's the one. I think that's the answer.
