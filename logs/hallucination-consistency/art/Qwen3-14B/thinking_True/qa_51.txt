Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 16, 1992, created by Donna Tartt. First, I need to recall Donna Tartt's works. She's an American author known for her novels. Her most famous book is "The Secret History," which I think was published in the early 90s. Let me check the publication date. I remember that "The Secret History" was released in 1992. Now, the exact date... I'm not 100% sure, but I believe it was September 16, 1992. Let me confirm. A quick search in my memory: yes, that's correct. The book was published on that date. So the answer should be "The Secret History."
