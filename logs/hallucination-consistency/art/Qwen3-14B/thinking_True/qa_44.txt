Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on November 20, 1990, created by Michael Crichton. First, I need to recall Michael Crichton's works. He's known for "Jurassic Park," "The Andromeda Strain," "Sphere," and "Timeline." Now, checking the publication dates.

"Jurassic Park" was published in 1990, but I need to confirm the exact date. Wait, I think "Jurassic Park" came out in June 1990. Then there's "Timeline," which was published in 1999. "Sphere" was 1987. "The Andromeda Strain" is from 1969. Hmm, maybe I'm missing another one. Let me think. Oh, "Congo" was 1983. What about "Rising Sun"? That was 1992. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to "Jurassic Park," but the date might be different. Let me check. A quick search in my memory: "Jurassic Park" was released on June 1, 1990. So that's not November 20. Then, perhaps another book? Maybe "The Lost World," which is a sequel to Jurassic Park. But that was published in 1995. 

Wait, could there be another book? Let me think again. Michael Crichton also wrote "Airframe," which was published in 1996. "Prey" came out in 2002. "State of Fear" in 2004. Hmm. Maybe the user is mistaken about the date? Or perhaps it's a different book. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a movie adaptation. For example, "Jurassic Park" the movie was released in 1993, but the book was earlier. 

Wait, maybe the user is confused between the book and movie release dates. If the book was released in November 1990, but I can't recall any of Crichton's books from that exact date. Let me check again. "Jurassic Park" book: June 1990. "The Lost World" book: 1995. "Sphere" 1987. "Timeline" 1999. "Congo" 1983. "Rising Sun" 1992. "Airframe" 1996. "Prey" 2002. "State of Fear" 2004. 

Wait, maybe the user is thinking of "The Andromeda Strain" but that's 1969. Alternatively, perhaps a non-fiction work? Crichton also wrote "Travels" which is a non-fiction book, but that was 1981. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different author? But the question specifically says Michael Crichton. Hmm. Maybe the date is incorrect. If the user is certain about the date, but I can't find a Crichton book from November 20, 1990, perhaps there's a mistake. However, "Jurassic Park" is the most famous one from around that time. Maybe the user mixed up the date. Alternatively, maybe it's a different book. 

Wait, I think I might have missed "The Terminal Man," which was 1972. No. "The Great Train Robbery" 1975. "Eaters of the Dead" 1976. "The First Casualty" 1983. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that was released in November 1990, but not by Crichton. But the question says Michael Crichton. 

Wait, perhaps the user is thinking of "Jurassic Park" but the exact date is different. If I can't find a book by Crichton from that specific date, maybe the answer is that there's no such book, but the user might be referring to "Jurassic Park" despite the date discrepancy. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the movie release date. The movie "Jurassic Park" was released in June 1993, but the book was 1990. However, the user specified the book's release date as November 20, 1990. 

Given that, I think the most likely answer is that the user is referring to "Jurassic Park," even if the exact date is different. But I need to be accurate. If there's no book by Crichton from that exact date, then the answer might be that there's no such book. However, since the user is asking, they might have a specific one in mind. 

Wait, I just checked my memory again. "Jurassic Park" was published on June 1, 1990. So the user's date of November 20, 1990, is incorrect. But maybe the user is mistaken. However, the question is to provide the name of the book if it exists. If there's no book by Crichton from that date, then the answer would be that there's no such book. But I need to be sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different work. Let me think again. Crichton's works: "The Andromeda Strain" (1969), "The Terminal Man" (1972), "Congo" (1983), "Sphere" (1987), "Jurassic Park" (1990), "The Lost World" (1995), "Timeline" (1999), "Airframe" (1996), "Prey" (2002), "State of Fear" (2004), "Next" (2006), "Micro" (2011). 

None of these are from November 20, 1990. So perhaps the user is mistaken about the date. However, the most famous book by Crichton from around that time is "Jurassic Park," which was published in 1990, even if not on November 20. Therefore, the answer might be "Jurassic Park," but with a note about the date discrepancy. However, the user might have confused the date. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different book. 

But given the information, I think the best answer is "Jurassic Park," even if the date is slightly off. Unless there's another book I'm missing. I'll go with that.
