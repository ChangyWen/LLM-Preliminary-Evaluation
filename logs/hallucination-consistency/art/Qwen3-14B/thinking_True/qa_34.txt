Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on June 17, 2003, created by Michael Lewis. First, I need to recall Michael Lewis's works. He's a well-known author, especially for books like "The Big Short" and "Liar's Poker." But "The Big Short" was published in 2010, right? So that's not it.

Wait, the date given is 2003-06-17. Let me think. Another book by Michael Lewis is "Moneyball," which was published in 2003. Let me check the exact date. I remember that "Moneyball" came out in 2003, but I'm not sure about the exact month. If the user says June 17th, maybe that's the release date. Alternatively, maybe it's a different book. Let me think of other titles. "The Blind Side" was published in 2006, so that's later. "The Undoing Project" is from 2016. 

So "Moneyball" is the one that fits the 2003 timeframe. Let me confirm the publication date. A quick check in my mind: "Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game" was indeed published on June 17, 2003. That matches the date the user provided. So the answer should be "Moneyball."
