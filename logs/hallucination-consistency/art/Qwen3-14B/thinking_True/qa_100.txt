Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on November 9, 1984, created by Douglas Adams. Hmm, Douglas Adams is best known for "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," right? But when was that published? I think the first book in the series came out in 1979. Wait, the user mentioned 1984-11-09. Maybe there's another book by him around that time?

Let me check. Douglas Adams wrote several books, including "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe," which is the second in the series. That was published in 1980. Then "Life, the Universe and Everything" in 1982, "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish" in 1984, and "Mostly Harmless" in 1992. Wait, "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish" was released in 1984. But the exact date? I'm not sure if it was November 9th. The user might be mixing up the date with the release of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" movie, which was released in 2005, but that's not the book.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the release of the first book, but that was 1979. However, the date given is 1984-11-09. Let me confirm the publication dates. "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish" was published in 1984, but I don't know the exact date. If the user is certain about November 9th, maybe that's the date for that book. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, could there be another book? I don't recall any other major works by Adams in 1984. So the most likely answer is "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish," even if the exact date isn't commonly cited. The user might have a specific source that mentions that date, but based on general knowledge, that's the book from 1984.
