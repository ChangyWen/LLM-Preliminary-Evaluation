Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on October 17, 1990, created by William Steig. First, I need to recall who William Steig is. He was an American writer and illustrator, known for his children's books. One of his most famous works is "Shrek!" which was published in 1990. Wait, but I should check the exact date. The original "Shrek!" book was published in 1990, but I need to confirm the specific date. Let me think. I remember that the book was published by Scholastic, and the release date might be around that time. Also, the movie adaptation came later, in 2001. So, if the user is referring to the book, "Shrek!" is the likely answer. But I need to make sure the date is correct. Let me verify. A quick check in my memory: William Steig's "Shrek!" was indeed published in 1990. The exact date might be October 17, but I'm not 100% certain. However, given that the user specified that date, and "Shrek!" is his most famous work from that year, I think that's the answer they're looking for. I don't recall any other major books by him from that exact date. So, I'll go with "Shrek!" as the answer.
