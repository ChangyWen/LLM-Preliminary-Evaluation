Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 8, 1995, created by Michael Crichton. First, I need to recall Michael Crichton's works. He's known for "Jurassic Park," which was a big hit. But when was that published? I think "Jurassic Park" came out in 1990, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe "The Lost World"? That's a sequel to Jurassic Park. Let me check the publication date. I believe "The Lost World" was released in 1995. But what's the exact date? The user specified September 8. I'm not sure about the exact release date of "The Lost World." Alternatively, maybe another book? Crichton also wrote "Andromeda Strain," "Sphere," "Timeline," and "Prey." 

Wait, "Prey" was published in 2002, so that's later. "Sphere" was 1987. "Timeline" was 1999. So maybe "The Lost World" is the one. Let me confirm the publication date. A quick search in my memory: "The Lost World" by Michael Crichton was published on September 8, 1995. Yes, that matches the date the user provided. So the answer should be "The Lost World."
