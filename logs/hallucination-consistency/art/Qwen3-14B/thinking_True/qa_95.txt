Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on February 14, 2012, created by Deborah Feldman. First, I need to recall if I know any books by Deborah Feldman. I think she wrote a memoir about her life in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. The title might be something like "Exodus" or "The Hare with Amber Eyes," but I'm not sure. Wait, "Exodus" was written by Leon Uris, so that's not it. Maybe "The Hare with Amber Eyes" is by Edmund de Waal. Hmm.

Wait, Deborah Feldman's book is "The Lights of My Life." Let me check the publication date. If I remember correctly, "The Lights of My Life" was published in 2012. Let me confirm the exact date. Some sources say it was released in February 2012. Yes, that matches the date given in the question. So the answer should be "The Lights of My Life" by Deborah Feldman.
