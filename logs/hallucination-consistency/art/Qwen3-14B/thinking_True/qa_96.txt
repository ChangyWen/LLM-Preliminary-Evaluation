Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 26, 2001, created by Eoin Colfer. First, I need to recall Eoin Colfer's works. He's an Irish author known for children's and young adult books. His most famous series is "Artemis Fowl." Let me check the publication dates of that series.

The first book in the Artemis Fowl series is "Artemis Fowl," which was published in 2001. The exact date might be important here. I think the release date was April 26, 2001. That matches the date the user provided. So the answer should be "Artemis Fowl." Let me confirm that the author is indeed Eoin Colfer and the publication date is correct. Yes, that's right. The first book in the series was released on that date, and it's one of his most well-known works. I don't think there are other major books by him published on that exact date. So the answer is Artemis Fowl.
