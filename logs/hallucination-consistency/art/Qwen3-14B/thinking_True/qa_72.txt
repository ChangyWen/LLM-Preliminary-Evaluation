Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on February 19, 1963, created by Betty Friedan. Hmm, I remember that Betty Friedan is a well-known figure in the feminist movement. Her most famous work is "The Feminine Mystique," right? Let me check the publication date. I think that book was published in 1963. Wait, the exact date might be February 19th. Let me confirm. Yes, "The Feminine Mystique" was indeed published on February 19, 1963. That's the one. It's considered a foundational text of second-wave feminism. I don't think she wrote any other books that are as famous as this one. So the answer should be "The Feminine Mystique."
