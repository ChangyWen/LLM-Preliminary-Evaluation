Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 5, 1996, created by Frank McCourt. First, I need to recall Frank McCourt's works. He's an Irish-American author, best known for his memoir "Angela's Ashes." I think that was published in the 90s. Let me check the publication date. Yes, "Angela's Ashes" was published in 1996. The exact date might be September 5th. I should confirm that. A quick search in my memory: the book was released in September 1996, and it's his most famous work. So the answer is "Angela's Ashes."
