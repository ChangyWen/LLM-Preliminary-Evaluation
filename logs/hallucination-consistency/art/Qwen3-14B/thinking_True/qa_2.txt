Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 10, 1981, created by Dean Koontz. First, I need to recall Dean Koontz's bibliography. He's a well-known author, especially for his horror and suspense novels. Some of his popular works include "The Shining" (though that was actually written by Stephen King, but Koontz wrote a sequel called "Doctor Sleep"), "Watchers," "The Face of Fear," and "Phantoms."

Wait, but the user specified the release date as May 10, 1981. Let me check the publication dates of his books. "Watchers" was published in 1981. Let me confirm the exact date. A quick search in my memory: "Watchers" by Dean Koontz was indeed released in 1981. However, I need to verify the exact date. If I'm not sure about the exact day, maybe the user is referring to that book. Alternatively, could there be another book? Let me think. "The Face of Fear" came out in 1982. "The Funhouse" was 1983. "The Night Window" was 1984. So "Watchers" is the one from 1981. But I need to be certain about the date. If the user says May 10, 1981, and that's the release date, then "Watchers" is the likely answer. However, I should make sure that the publication date of "Watchers" is indeed May 10, 1981. If I can't confirm the exact date, maybe the user is mistaken, but given the information, "Watchers" is the most probable answer.
