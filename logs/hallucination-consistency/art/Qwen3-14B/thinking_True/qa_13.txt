Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 10, 1990, created by Neil Gaiman. First, I need to recall Neil Gaiman's works from around that time. He's known for "Sandman," which is a comic book series. But the user mentioned a book, so maybe they're referring to a novel.

Wait, "Sandman" was a comic, not a book. But maybe they're considering graphic novels as books. However, the release date is May 10, 1990. Let me check when "Sandman" was published. The first issue of "Sandman" was in 1986, but the series ran until 1996. The collected editions might have different release dates. However, the user is asking for a book, not a comic. 

Neil Gaiman wrote "Good Omens" with Terry Pratchett, which was published in 1990. Let me confirm the exact date. "Good Omens" was released on May 10, 1990. That matches the date given. So the answer should be "Good Omens." I need to make sure there's no other book by Gaiman from that date. His other works like "Neverwhere" came later, in 1996. So yes, "Good Omens" is the correct answer.
