Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 29, 2009, by Haruki Murakami. First, I need to recall Haruki Murakami's bibliography. He's a well-known Japanese author, famous for works like "Norwegian Wood," "Kafka on the Shore," and "1Q84." 

Now, checking the dates. "1Q84" was published in 2009. Let me confirm the exact release date. I remember that "1Q84" was released in Japan in two parts: the first part in May 2009 and the second part in December 2009. So the first part came out on May 29, 2009. That matches the date the user provided. 

I should also check if there are any other books by Murakami around that time. But I don't recall any other major releases in 2009 besides "1Q84." The user might be referring to that. Let me make sure there's no confusion with other authors or books. No, Haruki Murakami's "1Q84" is the correct answer here.
