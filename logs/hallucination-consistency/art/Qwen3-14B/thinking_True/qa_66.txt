Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on March 6, 2018, created by Tomi Adeyemi. First, I need to recall Tomi Adeyemi's works. She's a Nigerian author known for her young adult fantasy series. The most famous one is the "Children of Blood and Bone" trilogy.

Now, the first book in that series is "Children of Blood and Bone," which I believe was released in 2018. Let me check the publication date. Yes, the release date for the first book was March 6, 2018. That matches the date the user provided. So the answer should be "Children of Blood and Bone." I should make sure there aren't any other books by her published on that date, but I don't think so. Her other works came later, like the sequel "Children of Virtue and Vengeance" in 2019 and the third book in 2020. So the correct answer is definitely the first book in the trilogy.
