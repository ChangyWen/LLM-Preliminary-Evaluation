Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on February 28, 2002, created by Richard K. Morgan. First, I need to recall Richard K. Morgan's works. He's a science fiction author, right? I remember he wrote "Altered Carbon," which I think was published around that time. Let me check the publication date of "Altered Carbon." I believe it was released in 2002. The exact date might be February 28, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think if there are any other books by him around that time. "The Dark Shore" is another one, but that was later. "Broken Angels" came after "Altered Carbon." So, "Altered Carbon" is the most likely candidate. I should confirm the publication date. A quick search in my memory: yes, "Altered Carbon" was published on February 28, 2002. That matches the user's query. So the answer should be "Altered Carbon."
