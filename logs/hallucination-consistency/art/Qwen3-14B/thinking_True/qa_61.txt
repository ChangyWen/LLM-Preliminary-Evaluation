Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on August 24, 2010, created by Suzanne Collins. Hmm, I remember Suzanne Collins wrote "The Hunger Games" series. Let me check the publication dates.

The first book in the series, "The Hunger Games," was published in 2008. Wait, but the user mentioned 2010-08-24. Maybe they're thinking of a later book in the series? The second book, "Catching Fire," came out in 2009, and the third, "Mockingjay," in 2010. Let me confirm the exact date for "Mockingjay." I think it was released on August 24, 2010. That matches the date the user provided. So the answer should be "Mockingjay" by Suzanne Collins.
