Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 1, 2000, created by Robert Kiyosaki. First, I need to recall Robert Kiyosaki's well-known works. He's famous for "Rich Dad Poor Dad," which I think was published in the late 90s. Wait, but the user specified April 1, 2000. Let me check the publication date of "Rich Dad Poor Dad." I remember that the original book was published in 1997, but maybe there was a revised edition or a different book around 2000.

Alternatively, could there be another book by him around that time? Let me think. Robert Kiyosaki has written several books, including "Rich Dad's Guide to Investing," "Rich Dad's Increase Your Financial IQ," and others. But the exact date of April 1, 2000, might be specific. Maybe the user is referring to a particular edition or a different title. However, "Rich Dad Poor Dad" is his most famous work, and even if the original was 1997, perhaps the user is mistaken about the date or there's a different book. Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of a different author, but the name is Robert Kiyosaki. I should confirm the publication dates. A quick check in my memory: "Rich Dad Poor Dad" was first published in 1997, and then there were subsequent editions. The 10th anniversary edition was released in 2007. So maybe the user is confused with the date. However, if the user is certain about April 1, 2000, perhaps there's another book. But I can't recall another major book by him around that time. It's possible that the user has the date wrong, but given the information, the most likely answer is "Rich Dad Poor Dad," even if the exact date isn't matching. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different book, but I can't think of any other major titles by Kiyosaki from that specific date. I'll go with "Rich Dad Poor Dad" as the answer, noting that the original publication date might be different, but it's his most famous work.
