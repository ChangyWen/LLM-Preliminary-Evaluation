Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on August 17, 1996, created by Chuck Palahniuk. I know Chuck Palahniuk is an American author known for his gritty, often controversial novels. His most famous work is "Fight Club," which was published in 1996. Let me check the publication date of "Fight Club." I recall that it was released in 1996, but I need to confirm the exact date. Some sources say August 17, 1996. That matches the date the user provided. So the answer should be "Fight Club." I should make sure there aren't any other books by him from that exact date, but I don't think so. "Fight Club" is his breakout novel and the one most associated with that release date.
