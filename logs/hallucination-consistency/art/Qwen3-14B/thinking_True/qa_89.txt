Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on October 21, 1977, created by Katherine Paterson. First, I need to recall Katherine Paterson's works. She's an American author known for children's literature. One of her most famous books is "Bridge of Birds," but I think that was published later. Wait, no, "Bridge of Birds" was published in 1983. Hmm.

Another book she wrote is "The Great Gilly Hopkins," which was published in 1978. That's close to 1977, but not exactly the date mentioned. Wait, the user specified October 21, 1977. Let me check if there's a book by her from that exact date. 

Wait, maybe "Jacob Have I Loved" by Katherine Paterson? Let me check the publication date. I think "Jacob Have I Loved" was published in 1974. No, that's not it. 

Wait, perhaps "The Master Puppeteer"? No, that was published in 1975. 

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me think again. Katherine Paterson's most famous work is "Bridge of Birds," but that's 1983. Another possibility is "The Newbery Medal" winners. She won the Newbery Medal for "Bridge of Birds" in 1984. But the user is asking for a book from 1977. 

Wait, maybe "The Great Gilly Hopkins" was published in 1978, so that's not it. Let me check if there's another book. Oh, wait! "The Summer of the Swans" by E.L. Konigsburg was published in 1970, but that's not by Paterson. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to "The Tale of Despereaux" by Kate DiCamillo, but that's a different author and later date. 

Hold on, perhaps I need to verify the exact publication dates of Katherine Paterson's books. Let me recall: "The Great Gilly Hopkins" was published in 1978, "The Master Puppeteer" in 1975, "Bridge of Birds" in 1983, "Jacob Have I Loved" in 1974. 

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the date? Or perhaps there's another book. Alternatively, could it be "The Cricket in Times Square" by George Selden? But that's not by Paterson. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "The Swiss Family Robinson" but that's not by her. 

Wait, I'm not finding a book by Katherine Paterson from 1977. Maybe the user has the date wrong? Or perhaps it's a different book. Alternatively, maybe "The Wandering Earth" but that's a different author and genre. 

Wait, perhaps the user is thinking of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams, which was published in 1979, but that's not by Paterson. 

Alternatively, maybe the user confused the date with another book. But the question specifically says Katherine Paterson. 

Wait, maybe "The Newbery Medal" winner in 1977? Let me check. The Newbery Medal for 1977 was awarded to "The Mouse and the Motorcycle" by Beverly Cleary. Not Paterson. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the user is mistaken about the date or the author. Alternatively, perhaps there's a book that I'm not recalling. Let me check my memory again. 

Wait, Katherine Paterson's first book was "The Great Gilly Hopkins" in 1978. So if the user says 1977, maybe it's a typo. But the user is asking for October 21, 1977. 

Alternatively, maybe the book was published in 1977 but released on that specific date. However, I can't recall any of her books from that exact date. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to "The Tale of Despereaux" but that's not by Paterson. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of "The Secret Garden" but that's by Frances Hodgson Burnett. 

I think there might be a mistake in the question. However, given the information, the closest book by Katherine Paterson around that time is "The Great Gilly Hopkins" from 1978, but not 1977. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different book. 

Wait, perhaps "The Master Puppeteer" was published in 1975, so not 1977. 

I'm not finding a book by Katherine Paterson from October 21, 1977. It's possible that the user has the date or author incorrect. However, if I have to answer based on available knowledge, I might have to state that there's no such book, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "The Great Gilly Hopkins" and the date is a mistake. 

But since the user is asking specifically, I need to check again. Let me think: Katherine Paterson's bibliography. 

Wait, "The Great Gilly Hopkins" was published in 1978 by Viking Press. "The Master Puppeteer" in 1975. "Bridge of Birds" in 1983. "Jacob Have I Loved" in 1974. 

So, no book by her in 1977. Therefore, the answer might be that there is no such book, but the user might have confused the date. However, the user is asking for the name, so perhaps I should check if there's a book that I'm missing. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "The Newbery Medal" winner in 1977, which was "The Mouse and the Motorcycle," but that's not by Paterson. 

Therefore, I think the answer is that there is no book by Katherine Paterson published on October 21, 1977. However, if the user is referring to a different date or author, that might be the case. But based on the given information, I can't find such a book.
