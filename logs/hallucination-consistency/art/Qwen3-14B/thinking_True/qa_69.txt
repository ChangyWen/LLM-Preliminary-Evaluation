Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 30, 2009, created by Hilary Mantel. First, I need to recall Hilary Mantel's works. She's a well-known British author, and I remember she wrote a series of books about Thomas Cromwell. The most famous one is "Wolf Hall," which is the first in the trilogy. The sequel is "Bring Up the Bodies," and then "The Mirror and the Light." 

Now, checking the publication dates. "Wolf Hall" was published in 2009. Let me confirm the exact date. I think it was released in the UK in April 2009. The user specified April 30, 2009. I need to check if that's the exact release date. A quick search in my memory: yes, "Wolf Hall" was published on April 30, 2009. The other books in the trilogy came later. "Bring Up the Bodies" was 2012, and "The Mirror and the Light" was 2020. So the answer should be "Wolf Hall." I should make sure there's no other book by her published on that date. I don't recall any other major works by Mantel around that time. So the answer is "Wolf Hall."
