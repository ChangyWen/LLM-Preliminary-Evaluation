Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on June 27, 2006, created by Scott Lynch. First, I need to recall Scott Lynch's works. He's known for his novel "The Lies of Locke Lamora," which is part of the Gentleman Bastards series. I think that book was published around 2006. Let me check the publication date. Yes, "The Lies of Locke Lamora" was indeed released on June 27, 2006. That's the one they're referring to. I should make sure there aren't any other books by him from that exact date, but I don't recall any others. So the answer should be that book's title.
