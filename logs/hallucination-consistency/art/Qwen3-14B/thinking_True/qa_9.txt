Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on January 16, 2018, created by Jordan Peterson. First, I need to recall Jordan Peterson's publications. He's a psychologist and author known for his book "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos," which was published in 2018. Let me check the exact release date. I think it came out in October 2018, not January. Wait, maybe there's another book? Or perhaps the user is mistaken about the date. Alternatively, maybe there's a different work. But I'm pretty sure "12 Rules for Life" is his most famous book from around that time. Let me confirm the publication date. A quick search in my memory: yes, "12 Rules for Life" was published on October 16, 2018. The user mentioned January 16, 2018, which might be a mix-up. However, if there's no other book by Peterson from that exact date, the answer would still be "12 Rules for Life," even if the date is slightly off. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different work, but I can't think of any other major books by Peterson in 2018. So I'll go with that.
