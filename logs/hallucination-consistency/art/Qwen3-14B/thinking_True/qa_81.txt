Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on February 14, 2017, created by George Saunders. First, I need to recall George Saunders' works. He's an American author known for his short stories and novels. His most famous work is "Lincoln in the Bardo," which I think was published around that time.

Wait, when was "Lincoln in the Bardo" released? Let me check my memory. I believe it came out in 2017. The exact date might be February 14th. Let me confirm. Yes, I remember that the publication date was February 14, 2017. That's Valentine's Day, which is a notable date. The book is a novel that won the Man Booker Prize in 2017, which adds to its fame. 

Are there any other books by George Saunders from that time? He also wrote "Tenth of December," but that was published earlier, in 2013. So the most likely answer is "Lincoln in the Bardo." I should make sure there's no other book by him from that specific date. I don't recall any other major releases by Saunders in 2017 besides that one. So the answer should be "Lincoln in the Bardo."
