Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 12, 2005, created by Steven Levitt. Hmm, I remember that Steven Levitt is an economist, and he co-authored a well-known book with Stephen Dubner. The book's title is "Freakonomics." Let me check the publication date. I think "Freakonomics" was published in 2005. But wait, the exact date? I'm not sure if it was April 12th. Maybe I should confirm that. Alternatively, could there be another book by Levitt around that time? I don't recall any other major books by him. "Freakonomics" is definitely his most famous work. The publication date might be listed as April 12, 2005. I think that's correct. So the answer should be "Freakonomics."
