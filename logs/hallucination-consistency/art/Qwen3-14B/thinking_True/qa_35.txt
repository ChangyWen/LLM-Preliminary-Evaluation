Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on August 4, 2015, by N.K. Jemisin. First, I need to recall N.K. Jemisin's bibliography. She's known for her Broken Earth trilogy. The first book in that series is "The Fifth Season," which I think was published around 2015. Let me check the dates. Yes, "The Fifth Season" was released on August 4, 2015. That's the first book in the trilogy, followed by "The Obelisk Gate" and "The Stone Sky." Since the user specified the release date, that must be the correct one. I don't think she had any other major releases on that date. So the answer should be "The Fifth Season."
