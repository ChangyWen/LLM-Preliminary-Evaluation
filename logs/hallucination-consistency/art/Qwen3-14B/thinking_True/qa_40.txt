Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 13, 2016, created by Mark Manson. First, I need to recall Mark Manson's works. He's known for his self-help books, especially "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck." I think that was published around 2016. Let me check the publication date. Yes, "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" was released in September 2016. The exact date might be September 13, but I'm not 100% sure. However, I know that's his most famous book from that time. I should confirm the release date. A quick search in my memory: the book was published by HarperCollins, and the release date is indeed September 13, 2016. So the answer is that book.
