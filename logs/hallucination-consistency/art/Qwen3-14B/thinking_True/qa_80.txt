Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 12, 2005, created by Stephen Dubner. Hmm, I know Stephen Dubner is one of the co-authors of "Freakonomics." Let me check the publication date of that book. I think "Freakonomics" was published in 2005. Wait, but the exact date? I'm not sure if it was April 12th. Let me recall. I remember that the book was released in the spring of 2005, but the specific date might be different. Maybe the user is referring to that book. Alternatively, could there be another book by Dubner around that time? He also co-authored "SuperFreakonomics" with Steven Levitt, but that came out later, in 2010. So the most likely answer is "Freakonomics." I should confirm the publication date. A quick check in my memory: yes, "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything" was published on April 12, 2005. That matches the date the user provided. So the answer should be "Freakonomics."
