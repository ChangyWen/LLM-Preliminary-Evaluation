Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on July 2, 2002, created by Neil Gaiman. First, I need to recall Neil Gaiman's works around that time. He's known for "Sandman," but that was a comic series, not a book. Then there's "American Gods," which I think was published in 2001. Wait, the user said 2002-07-02. Maybe "American Gods" was released in 2001, so that's not it.

Another possibility is "Coraline," which I remember was a children's book. Let me check the publication date. Yes, "Coraline" was published on July 2, 2002. That matches the date given. Neil Gaiman wrote it, and it's a well-known book. I think that's the one. I should confirm the exact date to be sure. Some sources say July 2, 2002, for the UK release, and July 30, 2002, for the US. But the user specified July 2, so "Coraline" is the correct answer.
