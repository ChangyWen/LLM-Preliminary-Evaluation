Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 27, 2007, created by Luis von Ahn. Hmm, first, I need to recall who Luis von Ahn is. He's a computer scientist known for his work in human computation and CAPTCHA systems. He co-founded reCAPTCHA, which was later acquired by Google.

Now, the question is about a book he created. I'm not sure if he's an author of a well-known book. Let me think. He's more associated with academic papers and projects rather than books. Wait, maybe the user is confusing him with someone else? Or perhaps there's a book related to his work that was published around that time.

Wait, the date is May 27, 2007. Let me check if there's any book published on that exact date by him. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that's related to his projects, like "Human Computation" or something similar. But I don't recall a book by him with that title. Alternatively, maybe it's a book that he co-authored or contributed to.

Alternatively, could it be a book that was released on that date but not directly authored by him? For example, maybe a book that discusses his work. But the user specifically says "created by Luis von Ahn," so it's more likely he's the author.

Wait, I think I might be mixing up the dates. Luis von Ahn's notable work is the reCAPTCHA project, which started around 2007. But the book might not be directly related. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that was published on that date, but I can't recall any. Maybe the user made a mistake in the date or the name?

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a book that was released in 2007, but not on May 27. Let me check. For example, "The Art of Computer Programming" by Donald Knuth, but that's not by von Ahn. Or maybe "Programming Collective Intelligence" by Toby Segaran, but that was published in 2007, but not by von Ahn.

Wait, maybe the user is thinking of a book that's related to CAPTCHA or human computation. But I don't think von Ahn has written a book on that topic. He has written academic papers, but not a famous book. So perhaps the answer is that there is no such book, or the user might have confused the details. Alternatively, maybe the date is incorrect. Let me check if there's any book by Luis von Ahn published in 2007. A quick search in my mind... I don't recall any. So maybe the answer is that there's no famous book by Luis von Ahn released on that date. But the user is asking for the name, so perhaps I need to confirm again.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that was released on that date but not by him. But the question says "created by Luis von Ahn." Hmm. I think the answer is that there is no such book, but I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that's part of his academic work, like a thesis, but that's not a book. So I think the answer is that there's no famous book by Luis von Ahn released on that date. But the user might have made a mistake in the details. However, since the user is asking, I should provide the best possible answer based on available knowledge.

Luis von Ahn is primarily known for his work in computer science, particularly in the development of CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA, rather than authoring books. There is no widely recognized book created by Luis von Ahn that was released on May 27, 2007. 

The query might be based on a misunderstanding or confusion with other works. 

The final answer is:
