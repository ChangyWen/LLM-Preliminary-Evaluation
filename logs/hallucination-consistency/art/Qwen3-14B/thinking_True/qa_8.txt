Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on June 19, 2001, created by Neil Gaiman. First, I need to recall Neil Gaiman's works from around that time. He's known for "Sandman," but that's a comic series, not a book. Then there's "American Gods," which I think was published in 2001. Let me check the publication date of "American Gods." Yes, I believe it was released in 2001. The exact date might be June 19, but I'm not 100% sure. Another possibility is "Coraline," but that was published in 2002. So "American Gods" is the most likely answer here. I should confirm the release date. A quick search in my memory: "American Gods" by Neil Gaiman was indeed published on June 19, 2001. That matches the user's query. So the answer should be "American Gods."
