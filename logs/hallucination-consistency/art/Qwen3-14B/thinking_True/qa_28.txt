Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on April 5, 1974, created by Stephen King. First, I need to recall Stephen King's bibliography and check which of his books were published around that date.

Stephen King has written many well-known books, like "The Shining," "It," "Pet Sematary," and "Salem's Lot." I remember that "Salem's Lot" was one of his early works. Let me think about the publication dates. "Salem's Lot" was published in 1975, right? Wait, but the user mentioned 1974-04-05. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me verify.

Wait, "Salem's Lot" was actually published in 1975, so that's not it. What about "The Shining"? That came out in 1977. "It" was published in 1986. "Pet Sematary" was 1983. So none of those are from 1974. Maybe another book? Let me think. Stephen King's first novel was "Carrie," published in 1974. Wait, "Carrie" was released in 1974, but what date exactly? If the user is saying April 5, 1974, maybe that's when "Carrie" was published. Let me check that. 

I think "Carrie" was published on April 5, 1974. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be "Carrie." I need to make sure there's no other book by Stephen King from that exact date. But I don't recall any other major works from that time. So the answer is "Carrie."
