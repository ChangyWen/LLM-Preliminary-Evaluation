Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on September 13, 2007, created by Pablo Fenjves. First, I need to check if Pablo Fenjves is a known author. I don't recall that name immediately. Maybe it's a pseudonym or a less-known author.

Next, the date: September 13, 2007. I should think about books published around that time. Let me think of some famous books from that period. "The Da Vinci Code" was published in 2003, so that's earlier. "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" came out in 2007, but that's July, not September. "The Kite Runner" was 2003 as well. Maybe something else?

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a book that's not as well-known. Let me check if Pablo Fenjves has any books. A quick search in my mind... I don't remember any prominent works by that name. It's possible that the name is misspelled or the user is referring to a different person. For example, maybe it's Pablo Fenjves, but I can't find any records of that author. Alternatively, could it be a different name, like Pablo Picasso? No, he's an artist, not an author. Or maybe the user confused the name with someone else.

Another angle: the date September 13, 2007. Maybe it's a self-published book or a niche publication. However, the user mentioned it's a "famous" book, so it should be well-known. If I can't recall any such book by that author, perhaps the answer is that there's no such famous book, or the information is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a book that was released on that date but under a different name or with a different author.

Wait, could it be a translation or a lesser-known title? I'm not sure. Since I can't find any information on Pablo Fenjves as an author with a famous book from that date, I might have to conclude that there's no such book or the details are incorrect. However, the user is asking for the name, so I need to provide an answer. If I can't find it, I should state that there's no known famous book by that author on that date.
