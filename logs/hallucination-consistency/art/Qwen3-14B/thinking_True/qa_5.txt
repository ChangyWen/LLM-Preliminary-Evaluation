Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on October 3, 1978, created by Stephen King. First, I need to recall Stephen King's bibliography and check which of his books were published around that date.

Stephen King has written many well-known books, like "The Shining," "It," "Pet Sematary," and "Salem's Lot." Let me think about their publication dates. "The Shining" was published in 1977, so that's before 1978. "It" came out in 1986, which is later. "Pet Sematary" was published in 1983. "Salem's Lot" was released in 1979. Hmm, none of these are from 1978. 

Wait, maybe there's another book. Let me check. Oh, "The Stand" was published in 1978, but I think that was in December. Let me confirm the exact date. Wait, "The Stand" was first published in 1978, but the exact date might be different. Alternatively, maybe "The Dead Zone" was published in 1979. 

Wait, I might be mixing up the dates. Let me think again. Stephen King's "The Shining" was 1977, "Salem's Lot" 1979. What about "Firestarter"? That was 1980. "It" is 1986. Maybe "The Eyes of the Dragon"? That was 1987. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to a different book. Let me check the exact publication dates. Oh, "The Stand" was published on October 3, 1978. That matches the date given. So the answer should be "The Stand."
