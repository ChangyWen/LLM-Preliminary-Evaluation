Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 26, 2015, created by Jenny Han. I need to figure out which book that is.

First, I know Jenny Han is a popular author, especially known for her young adult novels. Her most famous series is the "Summer" series, which includes "The Summer I Turned Pretty," "We Were Liars," and others. Wait, but "We Were Liars" was released in 2014, right? So that's not it.

Then there's "To All the Boys I've Loved Before," which is another of her books. Let me check the publication date. I think that one came out in 2017, so that's after 2015. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's "The Kissing Booth"? No, that's a different author. Or maybe "The Crossover"? No, that's by Kwame Alexander. 

Wait, Jenny Han also wrote "The Summer of Chasing Mermaids," which was released in 2015. Let me confirm the date. If I recall correctly, "The Summer of Chasing Mermaids" is the third book in the "Summer" series. The first book, "The Summer I Turned Pretty," was 2011, then "It's Not Summer Without You" in 2012, and "We Were Liars" in 2014. Wait, but "The Summer of Chasing Mermaids" was published in 2015. Let me check the exact date. If the user says May 26, 2015, that might be the release date for that book. 

Alternatively, could there be another book? Maybe "The Love Hypothesis" by Ali Hazelwood, but that's not by Jenny Han. 

I think the answer is "The Summer of Chasing Mermaids" by Jenny Han, released on May 26, 2015. I should verify that date. A quick check in my memory: yes, that's correct. So the final answer should be that book.
