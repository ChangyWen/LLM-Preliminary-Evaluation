Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on October 10, 2013, created by Tom Bissell. First, I need to recall Tom Bissell's works. He's an author known for non-fiction and some fiction. His notable books include "The Disaster Artist" which was later made into a movie, and "Chasing the Scream" about the history of drug prohibition.

Wait, but when was "The Disaster Artist" published? I think that was around 2013. Let me check. Yes, "The Disaster Artist: The Untold Story of The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made" was published in 2013. The release date might be October 10th. I should confirm the exact publication date. A quick search in my memory: the book was released on October 1, 2013, by Dutton. Hmm, but the user specified October 10th. Maybe there's a different book?

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different work. Let me think. Tom Bissell also wrote "The Last Testament of the Dog" in 2012, but that's not it. Another possibility is "The Future of the Book" but that's from 2009. Wait, perhaps the user is mistaken about the date, or maybe there's a reissue. Alternatively, maybe "The Road to Monticello" was published in 2013, but that's a collection of essays. 

Wait, checking again: "The Disaster Artist" was published on October 1, 2013. The user might have the date slightly off. But if the user insists on October 10th, maybe there's another book. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a different author or a different date. However, given that "The Disaster Artist" is one of Bissell's most famous works and was published in 2013, it's possible that the date is a minor discrepancy. I should go with that unless there's another book I'm missing. I think that's the best answer here.
