Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on March 15, 2010, created by Michael Lewis. First, I need to recall Michael Lewis's bibliography. He's a well-known author, especially for books like "The Big Short" and "Liar's Poker." 

Wait, "The Big Short" was published in 2010. Let me check the exact date. I think it came out in December 2010, but the user specified March 15, 2010. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me think. "The Big Short" was released in December 2010, so that's not it. What other books did he write around that time?

Another possibility is "Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World," which was published in 2011. That's after 2010. Then there's "The Undoing Project," which came out in 2016. Wait, maybe "Flash Boys" was released in 2014. So none of those fit the 2010 date.

Wait, maybe the user is mistaken about the date? Or perhaps there's another book. Let me check my memory again. Michael Lewis's books: "Liar's Poker" (1989), "Moneyball" (2003), "The Big Short" (2010), "Boomerang" (2011), "The Undoing Project" (2016), "Flash Boys" (2014), "The Premonition" (2020). 

So "The Big Short" was published in 2010, but I need to confirm the exact release date. If the user says March 15, 2010, but I know that "The Big Short" was released in December 2010, then maybe there's a confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a different book. Wait, could there be another book by Michael Lewis in 2010? Let me think. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to the original publication date. Sometimes books are released in different regions at different times. But I think "The Big Short" was first published in the US in December 2010. So if the user is saying March 15, 2010, that might be incorrect. However, the user might have a specific source that says March 15. Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of a different book. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the audiobook or a different edition. But the main publication date for "The Big Short" is 2010, so maybe the user's date is off. However, since the user is asking for the book created by Michael Lewis released on that specific date, and given that "The Big Short" is his most famous book from around that time, even if the exact date is different, it's possible that the user is referring to that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken about the date. But given the information, the best answer would be "The Big Short" even if the exact date is December 2010. Unless there's another book. Wait, I can't recall another book by Michael Lewis in 2010. So I think the answer is "The Big Short," even if the date might not be exactly March 15. Maybe the user has a different source or there's a regional release date. But given the information, that's the most likely answer.
