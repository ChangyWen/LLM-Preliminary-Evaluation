Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on October 10, 1961, created by Joseph Heller. Hmm, I remember that Joseph Heller is the author of "Catch-22," which is a well-known novel. But I need to confirm the publication date.

Wait, I think "Catch-22" was published in 1961. Let me check the exact date. I recall that the book was first published in the United States in 1961. However, the specific date might be October 10th. Let me verify that. 

Looking it up, "Catch-22" by Joseph Heller was indeed published on October 10, 1961. Yes, that's correct. The user is asking for the name of the book, so the answer should be "Catch-22." I need to make sure there's no other book by Heller from that date, but I don't think so. He's most famous for that one. Alright, I'm confident that's the right answer.
