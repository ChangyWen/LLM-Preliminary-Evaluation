Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on July 17, 1961, created by Roald Dahl. First, I need to recall Roald Dahl's bibliography. He wrote several well-known children's books like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The BFG, James and the Giant Peach, etc.

Now, checking the publication dates. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was published in 1964, so that's after 1961. Matilda was published in 1988. The BFG came out in 1982. James and the Giant Peach was published in 1968. Wait, none of these are from 1961. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Oh, there's "The Magic Finger," which was published in 1967. No, still not 1961. What about "George's Marvelous Medicine"? That was 1981. Hmm. Maybe the user is referring to a different book. Wait, perhaps "The Twits"? That was published in 1982. Still not matching the date.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake with the date? Or perhaps it's a less famous book. Let me check. Roald Dahl's first book was "The Gremlins," published in 1943. Then "James and the Giant Peach" in 1968. Wait, maybe "The Witches" was published in 1983. 

Wait, I'm not finding any of his books from 1961. Maybe the user is confused with the date. Alternatively, perhaps the book was released in the UK on that date but published in another country later? Or maybe it's a different work. Alternatively, could it be a play or a short story collection? 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," but that's 1964. Wait, perhaps the user has the date wrong. Alternatively, maybe the book was released in July 1961 but not by Dahl. But the question specifically says created by Roald Dahl. 

Wait, I think I need to confirm the exact publication dates. Let me check a reliable source. According to Roald Dahl's bibliography, "James and the Giant Peach" was published in 1968. "The BFG" in 1982. "Matilda" in 1988. "The Witches" in 1983. "George's Marvelous Medicine" in 1981. "The Twits" in 1982. "Danny, the Champion of the World" in 1975. "The Minpins" in 1991. 

So none of these are from 1961. Maybe the user is mistaken about the date. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different book. Wait, "The Fantastic Mr. Fox" was published in 1970. "The Enormous Crocodile" in 1978. 

Wait, maybe the user is thinking of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," but that's by Douglas Adams, not Dahl. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a book that was released in 1961 but not by Dahl. But the question specifically says created by Roald Dahl. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a book that I'm not aware of. Let me check again. Roald Dahl's works: 

- 1943: The Gremlins
- 1947: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (no, that's not by Dahl)
- 1956: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (original title: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, published in 1964 in the US, but the UK publication was 1964 as well)
Wait, maybe the user is referring to the original publication date in the UK? Let me check. 

Wait, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was first published in the UK in 1964. So that's not 1961. 

Wait, perhaps the user is thinking of "The Witches" but that's 1983. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken about the date. If there's no book by Dahl from 1961, then the answer would be that there is no such book. But the user is asking for the name, implying that there is one. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different work, like a short story or a play. For example, "The Golden Goose" was published in 1961. Wait, is that a Roald Dahl book? Let me check. 

Wait, "The Golden Goose" is a fairy tale, but I don't think it's by Roald Dahl. 

Alternatively, maybe "The Enormous Egg" by James Thurber, but that's not Dahl. 

Hmm, I'm not finding any book by Roald Dahl published on July 17, 1961. It's possible that the user has the date wrong, or perhaps it's a different author. But given the information, I have to go with what I know. Since none of Dahl's major works are from that date, maybe the answer is that there is no such book. But the user is asking for the name, so perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, maybe "The BFG" was published in 1982, but the user might have confused the date. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different book. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is thinking of "The Twits" but that's 1982. 

I think I need to conclude that there is no famous book by Roald Dahl published on July 17, 1961. However, if the user insists, maybe they meant a different date. But based on the information available, I can't find such a book.
