Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a famous book released on May 10, 2016, created by Garrard Conley. First, I need to recall if I know any books by Garrard Conley. I think he wrote a memoir about his experience with conversion therapy. The title might be something like "Boy Erased" or "The Conversion of Garrard Conley." Wait, "Boy Erased" sounds familiar. Let me check the publication date. If I remember correctly, "Boy Erased" was published in 2016. The author's name is Garrard Conley. The release date might be around that time. I should confirm the exact date, but the user specified May 10, 2016. I think that's correct. The book was later adapted into a film. So the answer is "Boy Erased."
