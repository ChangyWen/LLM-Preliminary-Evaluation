Okay, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on February 14, 2012, created by Deborah Feldman. Let me start by recalling what I know about her. She's known for writing a memoir about leaving a strict religious community. 

The date is specific: 2012-02-14. I remember her memoir "Unorthodox" was published around that time. Checking the publication date confirms it was indeed released on Valentine's Day in 2012. 

The user wants the answer on a new line at the end. They might need this for quick reference, maybe for a project or trivia. Their question is straightforward, but ensuring accuracy is key since dates can be tricky. 

Deborah Feldman's work is significant for its exploration of personal freedom and cultural constraints. The book's impact includes a Netflix adaptation, which might be why the user is interested. They might be researching memoirs or adaptations. 

No deeper needs are obvious, but providing the correct title meets their request efficiently. Final answer is "Unorthodox".
