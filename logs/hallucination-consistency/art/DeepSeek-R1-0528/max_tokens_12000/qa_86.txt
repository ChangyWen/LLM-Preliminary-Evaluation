*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on October 10, 2000, created by Philip Pullman. Let me start by recalling Pullman's works. He's best known for the "His Dark Materials" series. The first book, "Northern Lights" (or "The Golden Compass" in the US), came out in 1995. But the user mentioned 2000, so that's not it.

Wait, the third book in the trilogy is "The Amber Spyglass." When was that published? I remember it was in 2000. Checking the exact date: yes, it was released on October 10, 2000. That matches the user's query. 

The user wants the final answer on a new line. They might need this for quick reference, maybe for a project or trivia. Since they specified the date, they probably already have some context but want confirmation. 

I should confirm that "The Amber Spyglass" is correct. No other Pullman books from that exact date come to mind. The first two books were earlier, so this has to be it. 

Make sure to present the answer clearly at the end. The user might be in a hurry, so being precise is key. No extra fluff, just the title as requested.
