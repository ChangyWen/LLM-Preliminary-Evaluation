Okay, the user is asking for the name of a famous book by Agatha Christie released specifically on November 6, 1961. 

Hmm, I recall Agatha Christie wrote many classics, but the date narrows it down. Let me mentally scan her publication timeline... 

Ah yes! That's the exact release date for "The Pale Horse" - her novel featuring the unusual premise of murder by supernatural means. The date is memorable because it's one of her later works when her popularity was already astronomical. 

The user seems to want just the title with no extras, but I should confirm why this precision matters. Maybe they're a collector verifying a first edition? Or a literature student cross-referencing dates? 

Since they emphasized a final answer on a new line, I'll keep the response minimal. Though part of me wants to add how this book later influenced real forensic science when a chemist recognized the thallium poisoning method Christie described! 

But no - they want brevity. Just the title, clean and clear. "The Pale Horse" it is.
