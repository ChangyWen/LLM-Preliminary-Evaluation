Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on November 9, 1984, created by Douglas Adams. I know Douglas Adams is the author of the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" series. The first book came out earlier, but I think the specific date mentioned corresponds to the third book in the series. 

Let me verify the details. Douglas Adams wrote several books in that series: "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" (1979), "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe" (1980), and then "Life, the Universe and Everything" (1982). Wait, that doesn't match 1984. 

I recall "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish" was released in 1984. Checking the exact date... yes, it was published on November 9, 1984. That fits perfectly. The user specified the date precisely, so this must be it. 

The user wants only the book name as the final answer in a new line. They seem to be testing specific knowledgeâ€”maybe a trivia enthusiast or someone verifying facts. The phrasing is clear and direct, so I'll match that efficiency in response. 

No need for extra commentary beyond confirming the title, though I'll naturally structure the response to end with just the book name as instructed. The core task is simple: identify the correct book based on creator and release date. 

"Life, the Universe and Everything" was 1982, so definitely not that. "So Long..." is the fourth book, published right on November 9, 1984. Case closed. Final answer locked in.
