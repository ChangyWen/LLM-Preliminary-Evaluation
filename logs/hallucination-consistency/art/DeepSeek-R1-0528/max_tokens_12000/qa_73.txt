Okay, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on March 15, 2010, created by Michael Lewis. Let me start by recalling Michael Lewis's works. He's known for financial and non-fiction books like "The Big Short" and "Moneyball." 

The date is specific: March 15, 2010. I remember "The Big Short" was released around that time. Let me verify the publication date. Yes, "The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine" came out on March 15, 2010. That matches the user's query perfectly.

The user mentions "created by Michael Lewis," which might be a bit informal, but it clearly refers to the author. The book is a non-fiction work about the 2008 financial crisis, focusing on investors who bet against the housing market. It was a critical and commercial success, later adapted into a film.

Now, considering the user's request: they want the answer on a new line at the end. I need to ensure my response is concise and directly addresses the query. The user might be verifying a fact, preparing for trivia, or needing the information for research. They didn't provide context, so keeping it straightforward is best. 

I should confirm that "The Big Short" is the correct title. Cross-referencing multiple sources confirms the date and author. No other books by Lewis match that exact release date. Therefore, the answer is clear. 

Finally, structure the response: provide the answer as specified, end with the title on a new line. This meets the user's instructions precisely.
