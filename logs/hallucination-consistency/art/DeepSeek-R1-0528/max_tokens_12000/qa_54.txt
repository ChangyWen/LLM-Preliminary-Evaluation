Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on October 10, 2013, created by Greg Sestero. I recall that Greg Sestero is best known for his involvement in the cult film "The Room," where he acted alongside Tommy Wiseau. 

Hmm, the release date is very specificâ€”October 10, 2013. That narrows it down significantly. I think the book is "The Disaster Artist," which is Sestero's memoir about the making of that famously bad movie. The timeline matches perfectly, and it became a bestseller. 

The user seems to want just the title, but they emphasized putting the final answer on a new line. Maybe they're testing precision or compiling data. I should keep it concise. 

I'll confirm the details mentally: Yes, Sestero co-wrote it with Tom Bissell, and it later inspired a movie adaptation. The date aligns with known publication records. No other book by Sestero fits this timeframe. 

Final answer locked in. I'll deliver it cleanly at the end.
