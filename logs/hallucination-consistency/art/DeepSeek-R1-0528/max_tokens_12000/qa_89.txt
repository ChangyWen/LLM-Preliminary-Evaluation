Hmm, the user is asking about a famous book released on October 21, 1977, created by Katherine Paterson. That specific date is key here. I know Katherine Paterson is a well-known author, especially for children's literature.

I recall that her most celebrated work is "Bridge to Terabithia," which won the Newbery Medal. But I need to verify the publication date. Upon double-checking my knowledge, yes, "Bridge to Terabithia" was indeed published on October 21, 1977. That matches perfectly with the query.

The user seems to want a straightforward answer, as they emphasized putting the final answer on a new line at the end. Maybe they're testing my accuracy or need this for a quick reference. It could be for a trivia game, school project, or just personal curiosity. 

I should make sure my response is concise and ends with the book title as specified. No extra fluff needed beyond confirming the details. The user might appreciate the precision since they gave exact parameters.

Final answer: Bridge to Terabithia. I'll present it cleanly at the end.
