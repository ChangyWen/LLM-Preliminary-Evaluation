Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on April 15, 2014, created by Jenny Han. Let me start by recalling Jenny Han's work. She's known for young adult novels, particularly in romance. 

The date is specific: April 15, 2014. I need to match that with her bibliography. Her popular series include "To All the Boys I've Loved Before," which was turned into a Netflix movie. Checking the release dates, the first book in that series came out in 2014. 

Wait, let me confirm the exact date. Yes, "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" was published on April 15, 2014. That matches the user's query perfectly. The user might be a fan of YA literature or looking for book recommendations, maybe after watching the movie adaptation. 

They specified the date and author, so accuracy is key. No other books by Han match that exact date. The mention of "famous" aligns with the book's success and film adaptation. 

Final answer should be clear and placed on a new line as requested. Ensuring the response is concise but informative, confirming the title and author to meet the user's needs.
