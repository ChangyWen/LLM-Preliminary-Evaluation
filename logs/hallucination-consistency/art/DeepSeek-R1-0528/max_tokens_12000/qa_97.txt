Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on October 21, 1992, created by Madonna. I remember that Madonna, the iconic pop star, ventured into publishing around that time. The date is very specific—October 21, 1992—so I should recall what book she released then. 

I know Madonna authored a controversial book called "Sex" that featured explicit content and pushed boundaries. It was a huge cultural moment, with a lot of media buzz. The release date matches perfectly: October 21, 1992. 

The user seems to want just the book's name, and they specifically asked for the final answer on a new line at the end. I need to make sure my response is concise and directly addresses this. 

I wonder if the user is testing my knowledge or if they're curious about pop culture history. Maybe they're researching Madonna's career or 1990s controversies. Either way, I'll keep it straightforward. 

For the answer, I'll confirm "Sex" as the book and present it clearly at the end. No extra fluff—just the facts as requested.
