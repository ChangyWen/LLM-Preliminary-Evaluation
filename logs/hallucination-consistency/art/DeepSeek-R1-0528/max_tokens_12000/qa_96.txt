Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on 2001-04-26 by Eoin Colfer. Let me recall Colfer's worksâ€”he's best known for the Artemis Fowl series. 

Hmm, the first Artemis Fowl book was published around that time. Checking the date: April 26, 2001, matches the release date of "Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident"? Wait no, actually the first book was simply "Artemis Fowl," and the Arctic Incident was the sequel. 

Double-checking publication records... yes! The debut novel "Artemis Fowl" came out on April 26, 2001. The user specified the exact date, so precision matters. 

The user seems to want just the title, no extras, but they did ask for the answer on a new line at the end. They might be testing factual recall or compiling data. 

Final confirmation: Eoin Colfer + 2001-04-26 = "Artemis Fowl." No other book fits. Response will be concise with the title isolated at the end as instructed.
