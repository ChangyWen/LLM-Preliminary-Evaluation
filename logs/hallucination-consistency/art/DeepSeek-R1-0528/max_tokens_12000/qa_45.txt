Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on June 17, 1974, created by James Baldwin. Let me start by recalling Baldwin's notable works. He's a prominent African American writer, known for essays and novels addressing race, sexuality, and social issues. 

The specific date is key. I remember that "If Beale Street Could Talk" was published in 1974. Checking the exact date: yes, it was released on June 17, 1974. That matches the user's query perfectly. 

Now, why is the user asking this? They might be a student researching Baldwin, a book enthusiast, or someone verifying details. The request for the answer on a new line suggests they want clarity, maybe for quick reference or to copy-paste. 

I should ensure there's no confusion with Baldwin's other works like "The Fire Next Time" or "Go Tell It on the Mountain," but those have different publication years. The date pinpoints "Beale Street." 

The user didn't specify needing context, but adding brief details (genre, themes) could enrich the response without overwhelming. Still, I'll keep the final answer clean as instructed. 

Final thought: Confirm the date one more time to avoid errorsâ€”yes, June 17, 1974, is well-documented for this book. All set.
