Okay, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on 2003-05-29 by Khaled Hosseini. 

Hmm, I immediately recognize this because Khaled Hosseini's debut novel is very well-known. The date matches perfectly with the publication history I recall. 

The user seems to want a straightforward answer with the title isolated at the end. They're probably verifying information or needs it for something specific. 

I should confirm it's "The Kite Runner" since that's his iconic work published exactly on that date. No other books match both author and release date. 

The request for final answer formatting suggests they might be copying it elsewhere, so I'll keep the response clean. 

Just double-checking: yes, 2003-05-29 is correct for The Kite Runner's first edition. No confusion with his later works. 

I'll structure the reply to first acknowledge the query, then deliver the title as instructed. Simple and precise since they didn't ask for extra details.
