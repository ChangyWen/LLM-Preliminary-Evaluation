Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on April 12, 2005, and created by Steven Levitt. That date format (2005-04-12) looks like the ISO standard, so I should interpret it as April 12, 2005. Steven Levitt is an economist, and I recall he co-authored a popular book around that time. 

Hmm... Freakonomics! That's the one. It was co-authored with Stephen Dubner and became a huge bestseller. Let me double-check the release date to be sure. Yes, multiple sources confirm it was published on April 12, 2005. The book applies economic theories to everyday situations, which made it really stand out. 

The user specifically wants the answer on a new line at the end. They seem detail-oriented with the precise date request - maybe verifying information or preparing trivia. No emotional cues in the query, so I'll keep it factual. 

Final confirmation: Steven Levitt + April 12, 2005 = Freakonomics. Got it. The response should end cleanly with just the title.
