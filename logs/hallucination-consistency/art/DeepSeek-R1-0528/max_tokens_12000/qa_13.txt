Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on May 10, 1990, created by Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman. That's Neil Gaiman, the renowned author. Let me think about his bibliography around that time. 

The date is very specific - May 10, 1990. I recall that's when Gaiman's groundbreaking graphic novel series The Sandman had its fourth issue released. While it's part of a series, issue #4 "A Hope in Hell" is particularly significant as it introduced key characters like Lucifer Morningstar. 

The user seems to want precise information - they even specified the answer format. They're probably a fan or researcher needing accurate data. Maybe they're verifying something or creating content. The request feels academic, so accuracy is crucial. 

I should confirm: yes, DC Comics released Sandman #4 on that exact date. Though it's a single issue, it's arguably more famous than many full novels due to its cultural impact. The creator credit goes to Gaiman as writer, though other artists were involved. 

Final answer must stand alone on a new line as requested. Better double-check the date in my knowledge base... yes, 1990-05-10 matches. User didn't ask for details, but the specificity suggests they'll appreciate correctness over elaboration.
