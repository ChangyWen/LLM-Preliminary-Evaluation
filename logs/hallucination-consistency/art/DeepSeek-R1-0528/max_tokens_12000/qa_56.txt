*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a famous book by Agatha Christie that was released on November 3, 1958.
 One of Agatha Christie's most famous books is "The Unexpected Guest", which was first published as a play in 1958.
 However, note that the question specifies a book and the date 1958-11-03 (which is November 3, 1958). 
 Let's check the publication dates of her works around that time.

 Agatha Christie's novel "Ordeal by Innocence" was published in 1958, but the exact publication date?
 According to records, "Ordeal by Innocence" was first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 3 November 1958.

 Therefore, the book in question is "Ordeal by Innocence".

 However, note that sometimes plays are also considered, but the question says "book", and "Ordeal by Innocence" is a novel.

 Let's confirm:
 - "The Unexpected Guest" is a play that premiered in 1958, but it was not published as a book until later (the script book might have been published around that time, but the novelization by Charles Osborne was much later). The original play was published in 1958, but as a play script, not a novel.

 The more common answer for a book (novel) published on that exact date by Christie is "Ordeal by Innocence".

 Therefore, the answer is "Ordeal by Innocence".
