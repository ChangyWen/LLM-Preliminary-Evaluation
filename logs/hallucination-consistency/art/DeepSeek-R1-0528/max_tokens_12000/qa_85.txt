*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a famous book created by Luis von Ahn and released on May 27, 2007.
 Luis von Ahn is known for his work in computer science, particularly as the co-creator of CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA, and also for founding Duolingo.
 However, the question asks for a book. The most notable book associated with him and released around that time is "Games with a Purpose" (GWAP) concept, but that might not be a book title.

 Alternatively, we recall that Luis von Ahn, along with his colleagues, published a paper on reCAPTCHA in 2008. But the date given is 2007.

 Let me check: The reCAPTCHA system was developed and launched in 2007. However, the question is about a book.

 Actually, upon second thought, I remember that Luis von Ahn did not publish a book in 2007. He is more known for his academic papers and his company.

 But wait, let's think about the date: May 27, 2007. That is the release date of a book? Or perhaps it's the date of a significant event?

 Alternatively, note that the question might be referring to the release of the reCAPTCHA system? But that is not a book.

 After reconsidering, I recall that Luis von Ahn is one of the authors of the book "Human Computation", which is a research area he pioneered. However, the book "Human Computation" by Edith Law and Luis von Ahn was published in 2011.

 Let me check again: The only book I can find by Luis von Ahn is "Duolingo: Learn a Language for Free While Helping to Translate the Web", but that is an article, not a book, and it was published in 2013.

 Alternatively, we might be thinking about the Harry Potter series? But that doesn't involve Luis von Ahn.

 Wait, the date May 27, 2007, is the release date for the seventh Harry Potter book, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows". However, that was written by J.K. Rowling.

 But the question says "created by Luis von Ahn". So that cannot be.

 Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the reCAPTCHA system which was launched in 2007? But again, not a book.

 After careful thought, I recall that Luis von Ahn and his collaborators published a paper on reCAPTCHA at the USENIX Security Symposium in 2008. The paper is titled "reCAPTCHA: Human-Based Character Recognition via Web Security Measures". But that was in 2008.

 However, the system was launched in 2007. But the question specifically asks for a book.

 Now I suspect that the question might have a mistake, or perhaps I am missing something.

 Let me try to search in my knowledge base: 

 There is a famous book released on 2007-05-27: "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" by J.K. Rowling.

 But the question says "created by Luis von Ahn". So unless there's a connection I'm missing, that doesn't fit.

 Alternatively, is there a book about Luis von Ahn's work that was released on that day? I don't think so.

 After double-checking, I found that Luis von Ahn did not write a book that was released on May 27, 2007.

 However, note that the reCAPTCHA system was first deployed in 2007 and specifically on May 27? I cannot find a source for that exact date.

 Given the above, I think there might be a confusion. The most famous book released on May 27, 2007, is "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows". But it's not by Luis von Ahn.

 Alternatively, the question might be about a book that Luis von Ahn created (as in, the content was created by him) but written by someone else? I don't know of any.

 After re-examining, I recall that Luis von Ahn was involved in the ESP Game, which was licensed to Google and became the Google Image Labeler. But again, that's not a book.

 I think I have to conclude that the book in question is not directly by Luis von Ahn, but perhaps the question is referring to the Harry Potter book? That doesn't make sense.

 Wait, maybe the question is about the book that was used in the reCAPTCHA project? The reCAPTCHA project used scanned books to have users transcribe words. And on that specific date, they might have launched with a particular book? But that's not a book created by Luis von Ahn.

 Alternatively, perhaps the book is about Luis von Ahn? But again, I don't know of any released on that date.

 Given the constraints, the only famous book released on May 27, 2007, is "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows". And even though it's not by Luis von Ahn, it might be the answer the question expects? But the question says "created by Luis von Ahn", so that doesn't fit.

 Alternatively, I found that Luis von Ahn was one of the authors of a paper titled "reCAPTCHA: Human-Based Character Recognition via Web Security Measures", which was published in 2008. But the system was created in 2007. However, that is not a book.

 After all, I think the intended answer might be "reCAPTCHA" as a system, but the question asks for a book.

 I have to make a decision: 

 The most famous book released on that day is "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", but it's not by Luis von Ahn.

 Alternatively, if we consider that the reCAPTCHA system was launched in 2007 and that it involved digitizing books, then perhaps the book being digitized is the famous one? But that's not a specific book.

 Given the lack of a direct match, I will go with the most famous book released on that day, even though it doesn't match the author. But the question specifically says "created by Luis von Ahn", so that would be incorrect.

 Alternatively, I recall that Luis von Ahn is the founder of Duolingo, but that was launched in 2011.

 I think there might be a mistake in the question. But let me try one more thing: 

 In 2007, Luis von Ahn and his team were working on reCAPTCHA, and they were digitizing the archives of The New York Times and books from Google Books. However, no specific book was released by him on that date.

 Therefore, I must conclude that the book is "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", and hope that the question has a mistake? Or perhaps the question is about a book that was being digitized by reCAPTCHA on that day? But that's not a famous book created by Luis von Ahn.

 After careful thought, I remember that Luis von Ahn did not write any book in 2007. The only possibility is that the book in question is not written by him but is associated with his work. But the question says "created by Luis von Ahn".

 Alternatively, the book might be a collection of his papers? Not on that specific date.

 Given the above, I will have to say that there is no such book by Luis von Ahn released on that date. But the question insists, so perhaps I am missing something.

 Wait, I found a reference: Luis von Ahn was a co-author of a paper presented at CHI 2008: "Improving Accessibility of the Web with a Computer Game". But that's a paper, not a book.

 I think the only plausible answer is that the book is "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", but that is not by Luis von Ahn.

 However, note that the question might be a trick: the book was released on that date and it was created by Luis von Ahn in the sense that he helped digitize it via reCAPTCHA? But that's a stretch.

 Alternatively, maybe the book is the one that was being digitized by reCAPTCHA and released to the public on that day? But I don't think so.

 After re-examining, I found that the reCAPTCHA system was launched in 2007 and the first book they digitized was the book "Moby Dick"? But that was already in the public domain.

 I think I have to give up and provide the most famous book released on that day, which is:

 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

 But note: the question says "created by Luis von Ahn". This book was created by J.K. Rowling.

 Therefore, I must conclude that the question has an error. However, if we must answer with a book title released on that date, then it's "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows".

 But wait, the question might be referring to a book that Luis von Ahn created as part of his work, but it's not a traditional book. For example, the reCAPTCHA system was used to digitize books, so the digital version of a book was created on that day? But that's not a specific book.

 Given the confusion, I will provide the answer as "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" because it is the only famous book released on that day, and hope that the question's mention of Luis von Ahn is a mistake.

 However, let me check the date again: 2007-05-27 is indeed the release date for "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows".

 Therefore, I will answer:

 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

 But note: This does not match the author "Luis von Ahn". So if the question is correct, then there is no book.

 Alternatively, perhaps the question means that Luis von Ahn created a system that was released on that date, and that system is famous like a book? But the question says "book".

 I think the safe answer is to say that there is no book by Luis von Ahn released on that day, but the most famous book released on that day is Harry Potter.

 However, the instruction says to give the final answer on a new line at the end.

 Given the above, I will output:

 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

 But I am not confident.

 Alternatively, after a quick search in my mind, I recall that the reCAPTCHA system was announced in 2007 and it was used to digitize the entire archive of The New York Times. But that's not a book.

 I think I have to stick with the Harry Potter book.

 Final Answer:
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

**************************************** Content ***************************************
The famous book released on 2007-05-27 is *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows* by J.K. Rowling. However, this does not match the creator specified in the query (Luis von Ahn). Luis von Ahn is known for creating reCAPTCHA (launched in 2007) and co-founding Duolingo, but he did not author a book released on that specific date. The only notable book matching the release date is *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, though it is unrelated to Luis von Ahn. If the query intended to reference a work by Luis von Ahn, it may be conflating the reCAPTCHA launch (which occurred in 2007) with a book release.

Final Answer:  
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
