*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on January 12, 2016, and created by Paul Kalanithi. Let me start by recalling what I know about this author. Paul Kalanithi was a neurosurgeon who wrote a memoir. The title is "When Breath Becomes Air." 

I need to verify the release date. I remember that the book was published posthumously, and the date matches January 12, 2016. The user specified that exact date, so that's correct. 

The user mentioned "created by," which is a bit unusual. Typically, we say "written by" or "authored by," but I understand they mean the author. Paul Kalanithi is indeed the author. 

The user also wants the final answer on a new line at the end. I should structure my response to provide context first, then the answer as specified. 

Now, considering the user's possible deeper needs. They might be looking for more than just the title. Maybe they want to know why the book is significant. Including a brief note about its themes—like facing mortality, life's meaning—could add value. Also, mentioning that Kalanithi wrote it while battling cancer might address an unspoken interest in the author's background. 

The user might be a student, a book enthusiast, or someone dealing with similar life questions. Highlighting the book's impact could resonate with them. Ensuring accuracy is crucial here since the date is specific. Double-checking sources confirms the release date and authorship. 

Finally, end with the title alone on a new line as requested. Keep the response clear and concise, but informative enough to satisfy both the explicit and implicit queries.
