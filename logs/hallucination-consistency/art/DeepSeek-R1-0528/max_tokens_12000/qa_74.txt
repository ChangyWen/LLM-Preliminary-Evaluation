Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on April 13, 1953, created by Ian Fleming. I recognize Ian Fleming as the author of the James Bond series. The date stands out because it's the publication date for the first Bond novel. 

The user wants a clear answer with the final book name on a new line at the end. They might be testing precision or need it for trivia. The phrasing suggests they value accuracy, so I'll double-check the date—yes, "Casino Royale" debuted on that exact day. 

Beyond the answer, they could be a Bond fan exploring origins or a student verifying facts. Either way, keeping it concise but polished respects their request. 

Final step: Isolate the title as instructed. "Casino Royale" it is—no extra fluff, just the clean response they asked for.
