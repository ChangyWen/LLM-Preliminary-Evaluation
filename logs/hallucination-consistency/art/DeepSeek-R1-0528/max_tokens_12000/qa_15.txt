We are looking for a famous book by Robert Kiyosaki that was released on April 1, 2000.
 The most famous book by Robert Kiyosaki is "Rich Dad Poor Dad", but let's check the publication date.
 However, note that the publication date of the first edition of "Rich Dad Poor Dad" is 1997. But the question says 2000-04-01.

 Wait, let me recall: 
   - The book was self-published in 1997 and then picked up by Warner Books and released in April 2000.

 So, the mass-market publication date by Warner Books was April 1, 2000.

 Therefore, the book is "Rich Dad Poor Dad".
