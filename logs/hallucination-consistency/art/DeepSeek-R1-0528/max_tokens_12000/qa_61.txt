*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, the user is asking for the name of a famous book released on August 24, 2010, created by Suzanne Collins. Let me recall Suzanne Collins' works. She's best known for "The Hunger Games" series. 

The first book in that series is "The Hunger Games," but I need to verify the release date. I remember the publication date was in 2008. Wait, that doesn't match. The user specified 2010. 

Perhaps they're referring to the third book? The trilogy includes "The Hunger Games" (2008), "Catching Fire" (2009), and "Mockingjay." Checking the release date for "Mockingjay," it came out on August 24, 2010. That matches exactly. 

The user mentioned "created by Suzanne Collins," which aligns with her authorship. The date is precise, so "Mockingjay" is the correct answer. 

I should make sure there aren't other books she released on that date. After a quick mental scan, no, "Mockingjay" is the one. The user might be a fan or need this for trivia, so accuracy is key. 

Final answer: Mockingjay. I'll present it clearly at the end as requested.
