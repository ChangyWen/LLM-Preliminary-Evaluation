*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a famous book by Isaac Asimov that was released on December 2, 1950.
 Isaac Asimov is a renowned science fiction author. One of his most famous works is the "Foundation" series.
 The first book in the series, "Foundation", was published as a book in 1951, but it was originally a series of short stories in Astounding Magazine from 1942 to 1950.
 However, note that the question asks for a book released on 1950-12-02 (December 2, 1950). 

 Let me check: 
 - The first book publication of the Foundation stories was in 1951 (titled "Foundation"). 
 - But what about the stories? The last story in the original Foundation trilogy to be published in the magazine was in 1950? 

 Actually, the first book that collected the Foundation stories was "Foundation", published by Gnome Press in 1951. So that doesn't match the date.

 Alternatively, consider that Asimov's novel "I, Robot" was published in 1950. But let's check the exact date:
 - "I, Robot" is a collection of short stories that was published by Gnome Press in December 1950. Specifically, the publication date was December 2, 1950.

 Therefore, the book that matches the date is "I, Robot".

 Final Answer: I, Robot
