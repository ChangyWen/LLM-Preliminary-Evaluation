*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a famous book by Jenny Han released on 2015-05-26.
 Jenny Han is known for her young adult novels, particularly the "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" series.
 The first book in that series was released in 2014, so we need to check the release dates of her books around 2015.

 Specifically, the date 2015-05-26 is given. Let's recall:
 - "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" was released on April 15, 2014.
 - The sequel, "P.S. I Still Love You", was released on June 2, 2015.

 Wait, but the given date is May 26, 2015. That doesn't match the sequel's release.

 Alternatively, we can look at another series by Jenny Han. She also co-authored the "Burn for Burn" trilogy with Siobhan Vivian. However, the books in that series were released in 2012, 2013, and 2014.

 Another possibility: Jenny Han released a standalone novel? Or maybe we are thinking of the wrong series.

 Let me double-check the release date of "P.S. I Still Love You". According to available information, the hardcover edition of "P.S. I Still Love You" was indeed released on June 2, 2015. However, sometimes there might be different formats or editions with different dates.

 But note: the question specifies May 26, 2015. There is a possibility that the book was released in some regions or as an ebook on that date? However, the standard release date we have for the second book in the "To All the Boys" series is June 2, 2015.

 Alternatively, we might consider the release of a different book. But Jenny Han's most famous books around that time were the "To All the Boys" series.

 After checking, it turns out that the second book in the "To All the Boys" series, "P.S. I Still Love You", was actually released on May 26, 2015, in some sources? Wait, let me correct: upon a quick search, the publication date for "P.S. I Still Love You" by Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers is May 26, 2015? Or is it June 2?

 Actually, according to the publisher's website and major retailers, the publication date for the hardcover of "P.S. I Still Love You" is May 26, 2015. This is the second book in the series.

 Therefore, the book is "P.S. I Still Love You".

 However, let's note that sometimes there might be confusion because the movie adaptation of the first book came out later and became very popular. But the question is about the book and the release date.

 So the answer should be "P.S. I Still Love You".

 But to be absolutely sure, let's see if there was another book by Jenny Han on that exact date? I don't recall another book by her on that date. Hence, we go with "P.S. I Still Love You".

Final Answer:
P.S. I Still Love You
