Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on November 30, 1955, created by Patricia Highsmith. Let me start by recalling Highsmith's works. She's best known for her psychological thrillers, especially the Tom Ripley series. 

The date is specific: 1955-11-30. I remember that "The Talented Mr. Ripley" was published around that time. Checking the exact date in my knowledge base, yes, it matches. That novel introduced Tom Ripley, a character who became iconic in crime fiction. 

The user wants just the book's name, with the answer on a new line at the end. They might be verifying a fact or need it for research. Since they specified the format, they probably want a concise response without extra details. 

I should confirm the details: Patricia Highsmith as the author, the exact date, and the book's fame. No other books by her match that date. So "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is the correct answer. 

Finally, structure the response to end with the book title on a new line, keeping it clear and direct to meet their request.
