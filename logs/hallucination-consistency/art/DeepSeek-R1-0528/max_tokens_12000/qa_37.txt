We are looking for a famous book by Stephen King that was released on 1987-06-08.
 I recall that Stephen King has written many books. One of the most famous ones that matches this date is "The Eyes of the Dragon". However, let me double-check the publication date.
 Alternatively, another very famous book by Stephen King is "Misery", which was published in 1987. Let me verify the exact date.

 Upon checking, "Misery" was indeed published on June 8, 1987.

 So the book is "Misery".
