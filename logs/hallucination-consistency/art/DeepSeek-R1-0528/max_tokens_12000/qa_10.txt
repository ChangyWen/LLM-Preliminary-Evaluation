*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a famous book by J.R.R. Tolkien that was released on September 15, 1977.
 J.R.R. Tolkien is known for his works in the fantasy genre, especially "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Hobbit".
 However, note that Tolkien passed away in 1973. The book released in 1977 is likely one published posthumously.
 The most famous posthumous publication of Tolkien's work in that year is "The Silmarillion", which was edited and published by his son Christopher Tolkien.
 Therefore, the book is "The Silmarillion".

 Let's confirm the date: The Silmarillion was published on September 15, 1977.

 So the answer is "The Silmarillion".
