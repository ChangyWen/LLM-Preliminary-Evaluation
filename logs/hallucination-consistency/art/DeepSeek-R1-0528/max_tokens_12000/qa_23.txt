Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on March 7, 2000, created by Mark Z. Danielewski. Let me start by recalling the author's notable works. Mark Z. Danielewski is known for "House of Leaves," which is a highly experimental horror novel. 

I remember that "House of Leaves" was published around that time. Checking the publication date: yes, it was released on March 7, 2000. That matches the user's query exactly. 

The user specifically mentions the date and author, so they likely need precise confirmation. They also want the final answer on a new line at the end. 

I should verify if there are any other books by Danielewski released on that exact date. But to my knowledge, "House of Leaves" is his debut and most famous work, especially from that time. 

The user might be a literature enthusiast or a student researching postmodern literature. They might need this for academic purposes or personal interest. Their request is straightforward, but ensuring accuracy is key here. 

No other books by Danielewski match that date. So, "House of Leaves" is the correct answer. I'll present it clearly at the end as requested.
