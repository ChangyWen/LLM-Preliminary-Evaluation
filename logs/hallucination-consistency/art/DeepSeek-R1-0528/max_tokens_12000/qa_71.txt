*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a famous book by Philip Pullman that was released on 1997-07-22.
 The most famous series by Philip Pullman is "His Dark Materials". The first book in the series, "Northern Lights" (published as "The Golden Compass" in North America), was actually published in 1995 in the UK. However, the second book in the series, "The Subtle Knife", was published in 1997.

 But note the date: 1997-07-22. Let's check the publication date of "The Subtle Knife".
 According to records, "The Subtle Knife" was first published in the UK on 22 July 1997.

 Therefore, the book in question is "The Subtle Knife".

 However, note that the question asks for the name of the book. The book is the second in the series and is titled "The Subtle Knife".

 But let's double-check: 
   - "Northern Lights" (UK, 1995) / "The Golden Compass" (US, 1996)
   - "The Subtle Knife" (UK, 22 July 1997; US, 1997)

 So the book released on 1997-07-22 is "The Subtle Knife".

 Therefore, the answer is "The Subtle Knife".
