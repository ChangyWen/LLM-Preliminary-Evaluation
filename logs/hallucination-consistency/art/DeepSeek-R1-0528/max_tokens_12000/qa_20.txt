Okay, the user is asking about a famous book by Truman Capote released on January 17, 1966. The date is very specific, so I need to recall which of Capote's works matches this. Truman Capote is a renowned author, known for classics like "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and "In Cold Blood." I remember that "In Cold Blood" was published around that time. Let me confirm the exact date. Yes, it was first published on January 17, 1966. The user wants the answer on a new line at the end, so I'll structure my response to build up to that.

The user might be testing my knowledge of literary history or verifying a fact. They could be a student, researcher, or just curious. Since they specified the format, they likely want a clear, concise answer without extra fluff. I'll keep it informative but direct.

For completeness, I should mention what "In Cold Blood" is aboutâ€”it's a groundbreaking true crime novel detailing the Clutter family murders in Kansas. That adds context without overwhelming the user. Finally, I'll end with the book title on a new line as requested. This approach balances helpfulness with precision.
