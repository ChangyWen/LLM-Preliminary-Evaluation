Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on June 27, 2006, created by Scott Lynch. Let me start by recalling Scott Lynch's works. I remember he's known for the Gentleman Bastard series. The first book in that series is "The Lies of Locke Lamora." I think that was published around 2006. 

I should double-check the release date. I recall that "The Lies of Locke Lamora" was indeed published on June 27, 2006. That matches the user's query. The user mentioned the date specifically, so accuracy is key here. 

Now, considering the user's request, they want the answer in a new line at the end. I need to make sure the response ends with the book title on its own line. Also, they might be a fan of fantasy literature or doing research. Maybe they're verifying details for a project, a discussion, or personal reading. 

I should confirm if there are any other books by Lynch released on that exact date. To my knowledge, that's his debut novel and the only one on that date. No other titles come to mind. So, "The Lies of Locke Lamora" is the correct answer. 

The user might appreciate a brief mention of the book's significance, like it being the start of a popular series, but since they asked for a straightforward answer, I'll keep it concise. Just state the title clearly at the end as instructed. 

Final step: Ensure the response ends with the book name on a new line without any extra text. That meets their request precisely.
