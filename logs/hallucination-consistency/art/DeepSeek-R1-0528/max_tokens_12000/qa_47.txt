We are looking for a famous book that meets two criteria:
 1. It was released on September 13, 2007 (written as 2007-09-13).
 2. It was created by Pablo Fenjves.

 Let's recall: Pablo Fenjves is known as a ghostwriter and author. He is notably known for his involvement in the book "If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer" by O.J. Simpson. Fenjves was the ghostwriter for that book.

 The book "If I Did It" was originally scheduled for release in 2006 but was canceled due to public outcry. However, it was later published in September 2007 by Beaufort Books. The exact release date was September 13, 2007.

 Therefore, the book is "If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer".

 We'll output the answer in a new line at the end.
