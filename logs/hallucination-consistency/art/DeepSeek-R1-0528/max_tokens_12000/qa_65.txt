Okay, the user is asking about a famous book released on September 5, 1996, created by Frank McCourt. 

Hmm, this seems straightforward - Frank McCourt is primarily known for one major work that fits this timeframe. Let me confirm the details: the publication date matches perfectly with Angela's Ashes, and it's his most celebrated memoir. 

The user specifically wants the answer on a new line at the end, which suggests they might be using this for quick reference or copying. I wonder if they're verifying a fact or working on some literary project. 

I recall Angela's Ashes won the Pulitzer Prize, so it's definitely "famous" enough to match the query. No need to overcomplicate this - the dates align, the author matches, and it's his signature work. 

Just to be thorough, I'll mentally cross-check: Frank McCourt's other books like 'Tis were published later, so this must be it. The response should be clean and precise since they want just the title at the end.
