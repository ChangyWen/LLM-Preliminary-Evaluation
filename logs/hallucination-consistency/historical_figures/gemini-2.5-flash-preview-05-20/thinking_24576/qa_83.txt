Okay, let's see. The task is to identify a historical figure based on some criteria. First, I need to break down the request: they want a name, and it's going to be someone born in 1879 who died in 1955, known for some specific achievements. Alright, let's pull out the crucial clues. "German-born theoretical physicist," that's a good starting point. And, *crucially*, "developer of the theory of relativity." The dates are helpful too, but that theory... that's the real giveaway.

Now, from my knowledge base, "theory of relativity" *immediately* screams a name: It's the obvious answer really, the most famous physicist of the 20th century. And, yes, the dates fit. 1879 to 1955, perfectly. "German-born theoretical physicist," checks that box too. It's a perfect match.

So, the answer is... Albert Einstein. I'll formulate the response as requested.

Albert Einstein
