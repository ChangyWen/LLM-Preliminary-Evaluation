Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a historical figure, and they've given me a pretty specific set of parameters. The year of birth, the year of death, and their area of expertise, which is the key here, "ancient Greek philosopher."

Right away, my brain starts churning through the usual suspects. We're talking heavy hitters here: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle. Then there's the pre-Socratics – Thales, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, the whole gang. And of course, the Sophists like Protagoras and Gorgias.

Now, let's apply the filter. The birth and death dates are crucial: -470 to -399 BCE. Okay, let's go through my mental rolodex... Plato and Aristotle are immediately out. Their birth years just don't align. Most of the pre-Socratics predate the birth year. And the Sophists are close but don't *quite* hit the mark. Hmmm...

Ah, yes! **Socrates**. Born around 470 BCE and died in 399 BCE. That fits like a glove! And, of course, he’s *the* ancient Greek philosopher. Considered one of the founders of Western philosophy. No need to overthink this. This is a textbook answer.

Socrates
