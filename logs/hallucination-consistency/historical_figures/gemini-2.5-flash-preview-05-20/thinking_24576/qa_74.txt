Okay, let's see what we've got here. The user wants a name, and it's a historical figure. Right, the clues are: born in 1892, died in 1973, and is known for being a British philologist and author of classic high fantasy.

Alright, so let's break this down. The dates, 1892 to 1973, that's quite specific. British nationality narrows things down, but not too much. Now, "philologist" - that's the key. It means someone who seriously studied language, its history, its structure, the whole shebang. And the final piece is "classic high fantasy".

That last clue immediately brings a few names to mind: Tolkien, of course. Maybe C.S. Lewis, though he's more aligned with allegory, and wasn't *primarily* a philologist like Tolkien. Then there's Le Guin, but she was American. And Robert E. Howard, but he focused on pulp fantasy.

So, let's filter by "philologist." Bingo! Tolkien stands out. He was a professor of Old English at Oxford. He literally *created* languages for his stories! It was a direct extension of his philological interests.

Now, let's check the dates. Tolkien... born January 3, 1892... and died September 2, 1973. **Perfect!** The dates match.

Okay, confirm everything: Born 1892? Check. Died 1973? Check. British? Absolutely. Philologist? Undoubtedly. And author of classic high fantasy? Absolutely. *The Hobbit*, *The Lord of the Rings*â€¦ classics!

Therefore, the answer is...

J.R.R. Tolkien
