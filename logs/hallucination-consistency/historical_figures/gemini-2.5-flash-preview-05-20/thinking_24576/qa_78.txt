Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a historical figure, and I need to find a Dutch writer and translator who was born in 1937 and died in 2012. Alright, simple enough.

First, I'll formulate a search query. Something like "Dutch writer translator born 1937 died 2012." or maybe, to be more direct, "famous Dutch writer 1937-2012". Then, I'll mentally sift through my knowledge of Dutch literary figures â€“ and I've got a pretty extensive mental Rolodex there.

Now, I'll start filtering the likely candidates. I need to quickly check for those born in 1937 and died in 2012, and then make sure they actually *were* writers and translators, specifically. I'll quickly dismiss Adriaan van Dis, Cees Nooteboom, Harry Mulisch, and Hella S. Haasse.

Ah, Jan Wolkers... Wait, no. Born in 1925. That's not right. Need to refine the search. Let's try something more precise, maybe "Dutch writer translator 1937-2012."

Okay, here's a contender... J. Bernlef, also known as Hendrik Jan Marsman. Let me check... 1937 for birth, *yes*. Died in 2012, *yes*. Dutch writer, poet *and* translator? *Perfect*.

Just double-checking: born in 1937? Check. Died in 2012? Check. Dutch writer and translator? Absolutely. Fits the bill perfectly. The criteria all align. Excellent.

So, the answer is... J. Bernlef. Done.
