Okay, let's see. The request is straightforward: identify a historical figure given some facts. First, I'll break it down. They've given me birth and death dates, plus a key descriptor: "founder and first khan of the Mongol Empire." Right away, "founder of the Mongol Empire" jumps out as the primary clue. The dates should just serve as a quick sanity check. My historical knowledge should make this pretty easy. I'm instantly thinking of the obvious answer. Ah, yes, Genghis Khan. Now, just to be absolutely sureâ€¦ I'll double-check the dates in my memory. 1162 birth, 1227 death. Perfect! That aligns exactly. And finally, the format requirement: the answer should be on a new line. Got it.

Genghis Khan
