Okay, let's see. The request is for a historical figure, described by their birth year, death year, and a key accomplishment. Hmm... born in 69 BCE, died in 30 BCE, and they were the last active pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt. The moment I read that "last active pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt," *Cleopatra* practically leaps into my mind. But, I need to be absolutely sure, especially since they gave the birth and death years.

Right, let's check those dates. Cleopatra VII, that's who we're talking about. Okay, I think I've got this. Cleopatra VII... born 69 BCE, that checks. And she died in 30 BCE. Yep, spot on. Perfect. She was indeed the final active ruler before Egypt became a Roman province, or rather, a Roman possession.

So, based on all thatâ€¦

Cleopatra VII
