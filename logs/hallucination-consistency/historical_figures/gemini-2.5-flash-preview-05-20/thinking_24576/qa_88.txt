Okay, let's see... the task is to identify a historical figure based on birth and death dates, and a field of expertise. Seems straightforward. First, the parameters: born in 1821, died in 1881, and known as a Russian author. My brain jumps to the usual suspects in 19th-century Russian lit: Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Turgenev, maybe Gogol, but he's a bit earlier, and Pushkin and Lermontov are definitely out.

Now, let's cross-reference the dates. Tolstoy... born 1828, so that's wrong. Dostoevsky... Aha! Born in 1821, died in 1881. Perfect. Turgenev is born in 1818, so that's a miss. Gogol's too early.

Alright, I think we've got it. Dostoevsky is the only one who fits the bill.

Here's the answer:

Fyodor Dostoevsky
