Okay, let's see. The task is to identify a historical figure based on birth year, death year, and known for. The criteria are pretty specific: born in 1431, died in 1463, and was a "French poet and criminal." Right away, this is a great little historical puzzle!

First, I need to break down the components. "French poet and criminal" is the key descriptor here, immediately bringing to mind the late medieval period. My mind immediately jumps to one name – a very well-known one that fits *most* of the criteria perfectly. Now, let's check the dates. 1431 for birth...that's good. The year of death, 1463... that's the potential snag. I know the death date isn't *certain*. Villon disappears from historical records after 1463. His last activity, as far as we know, was in 1463. He vanishes after being pardoned. So, I know his death isn't confirmed *in* that year, but that's the end of his known life.

If I didn't have this knowledge right off the bat, my next step would be a quick search using those key terms: "French poet criminal 1431 1463." However, I already know. The name is...François Villon.

Now, back to the death date. The prompt *specifically* states "died in 1463." Villon's disappearance is in 1463, which is the crucial point. Hmm, is there anyone else who aligns with this perfectly? Any other French poets with criminal backgrounds born in 1431 who died in 1463? Highly unlikely. A quick mental scan, or a quick search if needed, confirms this. Given that he was active until 1463, and that is the year of his disappearance, it's very likely this is the answer the prompt is looking for. It's almost a trick question, really!

So, the answer has to acknowledge the caveat about the death date. I need to make that clear: "The historical figure who fits this description is **François Villon**. While his exact death date is unknown, he was born around 1431 and disappeared from historical records after 1463, making 1463 the last known year of his life, and he is famously known as a French poet with a criminal past."

And now, for the final answer, as requested, on a new line:
François Villon
