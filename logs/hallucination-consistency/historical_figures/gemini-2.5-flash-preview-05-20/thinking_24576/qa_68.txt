Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a name – a historical figure – and it's based on rather specific dates and profession. Right, born in 1858, died in 1930, and they were a Chilean politician and President. No problem. I'll construct a quick search, mentally. "Chilean President 1858-1930" is the essence of it, I reckon.

Now, let's delve into my knowledge base. Who was prominent in that timeframe? Alessandri? No, born in 1868. Riesco? Nope, off on the dates. Montt? Nope. Barros Luco? He doesn’t fit. Wait… Sanfuentes. Juan Luis Sanfuentes Andonaegui, wasn't it? Let me just double check... Born in 1858, died 1930. Precisely! And, yes, he *was* President from 1915 to 1920. He definitely fits the criteria.

Alright, time to verify. Born in '58? Check. Died in '30? Check. President and politician? Check. Perfect.

Here is the answer:

Juan Luis Sanfuentes Andonaegui
