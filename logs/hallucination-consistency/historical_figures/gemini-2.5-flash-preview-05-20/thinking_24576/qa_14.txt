Okay, let's see. The user wants a historical figure, born in 1214, died in 1270, and known as the "King of France." Alright, that's pretty straightforward. "King of France"... that immediately triggers a mental search. The dates will be key to narrowing things down, though. The 13th century is the focus here. I'll quickly run through the usual suspects in my head. Let's see... Louis IX, definitely springs to mind. He's practically synonymous with "King of France" from that era. Philip II Augustus? No, he's earlier. Louis VIII? Also earlier. Philip III is later, succeeding Louis. Now I'll just have to double-check the dates to be absolutely certain. Let's confirm the birth and death years. Born in 1214, yes. Died in 1270... that seems right, he died during the Eighth Crusade, wasnâ€™t it? August 25th, 1270, in Tunis. Excellent. And of course, he *was* King of France, from 1226 onwards. Solid. Okay, ready to give the answer.

Louis IX
