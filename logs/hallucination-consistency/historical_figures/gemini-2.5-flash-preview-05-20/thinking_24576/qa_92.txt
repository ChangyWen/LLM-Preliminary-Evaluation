Okay, let's see. The user needs a name, based on some specifics. Alright, let's break this down. They've given me a date range, 1809 to 1882 – that's the lifespan. Then, they've dropped a clue: "British naturalist, author of 'On the Origin of Species, by Means of Natural Selection.'"

Right, right, right. "On the Origin of Species…" Classic. That's immediately the key. That's evolutionary biology, ground zero. Who wrote that? Darwin. Absolutely. And the dates… gotta double-check those dates, just to be certain. 1809 to 1882, that aligns perfectly with my knowledge of Darwin's lifespan. And he was, of course, a British naturalist. No doubt about it. This is a slam dunk.

Charles Darwin
