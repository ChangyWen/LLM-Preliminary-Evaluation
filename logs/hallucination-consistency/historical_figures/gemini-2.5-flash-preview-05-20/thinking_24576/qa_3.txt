Okay, let me break this down. The user wants the name of a historical figure, and they've provided a few clues. First, I need to understand exactly what they're asking – it's a direct name lookup based on a set of criteria.

Right, let's pinpoint the core information. The crucial piece is "16th president of the United States." The birth and death dates are just confirmation, a useful cross-check. I need to access my mental database of U.S. Presidents. Hmm, who was the 16th? Got it!

The answer is Abraham Lincoln. Now, just to be absolutely sure, let's verify those dates. Lincoln's birth date – 1809... yep, checks out. His death...1865... perfect match. Excellent.

The final step is formatting the answer according to the prompt.

The historical figure you are referring to is Abraham Lincoln.
Abraham Lincoln
