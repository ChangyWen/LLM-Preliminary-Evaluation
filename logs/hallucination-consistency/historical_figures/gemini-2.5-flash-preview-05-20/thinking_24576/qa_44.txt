Okay, let's see. The request is for a name based on birth and death dates, plus achievements. Alright, let me break this down. The dates, 1473 to 1543... right away, that gives me a very specific timeframe. They want someone from the Renaissance, someone who was a mathematician, astronomer, and clergyman. And the *crucial* detail, the big one: the heliocentric model of the Universe.

Now, who fits *all* those criteria? The heliocentric model… that’s a slam dunk. That’s Copernicus. Now, let me just quickly double-check. Born in 1473? Yep. Died in 1543? Correct. Renaissance? Indeed. A clergyman, mathematician, and astronomer? Yes to all three, especially considering the context of the era. He was a canon, which is a clergyman. His work *was* mathematics and astronomy. Okay, everything checks out.

Nicolaus Copernicus
