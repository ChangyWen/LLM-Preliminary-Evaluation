Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a historical figure, and the constraints are pretty specific. I need someone born in 1938 and who passed away in 1980. They were apparently a Soviet singer, songwriter, poet, and actor.

Right away, that combination screams a particular name to mind. The dates are critical; I need to be absolutely sure before I commit.

If I weren't instantly certain, my next move would be to fire up a search. Something like, "Soviet singer songwriter poet actor born 1938 died 1980" would do the trick, I think.

But, yeah, the name that pops into my head, that perfectly matches the description *and* the dates, is... Vladimir Vysotsky.

Let's verify. Vysotsky was born January 25, 1938. Yup, that checks out. He died July 25, 1980. Spot on. And the other details? Absolutely. Singer, songwriter, poet, actor. He's legendary for his baritone voice, his guitar, his theatre and film work. Critiques of Soviet life? Absolutely.

So, all the pieces are in place.

Vladimir Vysotsky
