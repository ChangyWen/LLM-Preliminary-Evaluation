Okay, let's see. The request is for a historical figure, based on a few details. Let me break this down logically.

Right, so the birth year is 1188, and death in 1252. That gives me a timeframe: late 12th, early to mid-13th centuries. The other clues are "Spanish princess and saint, queen consort of France." I'm thinking... Spanish princess... so, from a Spanish royal house, and then, a queen of France. And a saint!

Alright, let's process this. French kings... who were they in that period? Philip II Augustus, Louis VIII, then Louis IX, right? Any Spanish connections there? Gotta figure out which of them married a Spanish princess. My mind is already starting to churn through the possibilities.

If I don’t immediately know, I’ll need to refine the search. I might put something like "Queen consort of France 13th century Spanish saint" into a search engine. Or maybe "Spanish princess married French king saint," or even something like, "1188 1252 Spanish saint queen France". That should narrow things down nicely.

Aha! Louis VIII... He was married to... Blanche of Castile! Let's see... Blanche of Castile... Born 1188, right? Perfect. And she died... in 1252? Yes! And she was a daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile, which matches the Spanish princess description. Then, of course, she was the mother of Louis IX (Saint Louis)... hmm. Now, was she *actually* a saint?

Yes. Blanche of Castile. She's venerated as a saint, definitely. While I might say *Blessed* Blanche in my formal writing (given the lack of official canonization), the use of the word "saint" here is very common, particularly in popular descriptions and historical summaries, given her great piety and the reverence she received. It makes total sense.

So, check it all: Born 1188, check. Died 1252, check. Spanish princess, check. Queen consort of France, absolutely. And, yes, described as a saint, check. All the pieces fit! It has to be her.

Okay, here’s the answer, on a new line, just as requested.

Blanche of Castile
