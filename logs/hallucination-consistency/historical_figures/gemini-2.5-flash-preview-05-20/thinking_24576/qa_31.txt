Okay, let's see. The prompt is asking for a historical figure, and I need to use these clues: birth year 1821, death year 1867, and known for being a "French poet, essayist, and art critic." Right away, those dates jump out at me, coupled with "French poet." It immediately brings a name to mind, and the addition of "art critic" really seals the deal. This is practically a dead giveaway. Let me think... "French poet, 1821-1867...art critic..." Yes, that screams Baudelaire.

Now, I need to quickly verify. Born in 1821, died in 1867? Check. He was French, no question. Poet? Absolutely, *Les Fleurs du mal* is a cornerstone. Essayist? Of course, his work on hashish and opium, those essays on artificial paradises, are classic. And the art criticism? His *Salons* are foundational. Okay, that confirms it.

The answer is:

Charles Baudelaire
