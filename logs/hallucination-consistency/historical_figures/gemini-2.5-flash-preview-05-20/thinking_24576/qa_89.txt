Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a historical figure: born in '21, died in '89, a Soviet nuclear physicist, *and* a human rights activist. That's a very specific combination.

My mind immediately jumps to the Soviet atomic bomb program - nuclear physics in that era means that's the territory. The human rights aspect narrows the field considerably, pointing towards known dissidents.

Now, I'm running through the possibilities. Who were the big Soviet nuclear physicists? Kurchatov, Sakharov, Zeldovich... and who fought for human rights? Sakharov, Solzhenitsyn, Sharansky, Bonner...

Now, to cross-reference. Born in 1921, died in 1989... Hmm... *Sakharov*. Let's check. Born in 1921? Check. Died in 1989? Check. Absolutely a nuclear physicist, central to the Soviet hydrogen bomb program? Check. A leading human rights activist, Nobel Peace Prize winner, exiled? Check, check, check!

Alright, let's quickly eliminate the other possibilities. Kurchatov is out; he died way before that. Solzhenitsyn, no, he's a writer. Zeldovich... Primarily a physicist, but not as well-known for human rights. Bonner, Sakharov's wife, is an activist, but not a physicist.

Sakharov is the *only* logical answer. He checks every box.

Final Answer:
Andrei Sakharov
