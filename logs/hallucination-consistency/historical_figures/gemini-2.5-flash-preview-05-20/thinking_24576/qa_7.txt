Okay, here's what's going through my head. First, I need to break down this request. The user wants a French writer, born in 1888 and who died in 1976. Easy enough. My next step is to formulate a mental search query; "French writer born 1888 died 1976."

Alright, let's dive into the mental database. Immediately, I'm scanning for those big French literary names of that period. The birth and death years are crucial here. Given the dates, I'm thinking of the 20th century, particularly the interwar period and post-war eras. Hmm, Proust? No, wrong dates. Gide? Nope. Camus? No luck there either. Sartre? De Beauvoir? Again, the dates just don't align perfectly.

I start mentally ticking off the dates of potential candidates. I need to be precise. Simone de Beauvoir? No. Jean-Paul Sartre? Nope. Albert Camus? Wrong again. Let's see... André Gide? Too early. Marcel Proust? Nope. Colette? No.

Okay, let's try some other figures. François Mauriac...born in 1885 and died in 1970. Close, but not quite. What about Paul Claudel or Georges Bernanos? Nope and nope. Then, I zero in on: Henri Bosco. Born in 1888...and died in 1976! Hold on...let me double-check his credentials. Yes, he was a French writer, poet, and essayist. Bingo!

To be absolutely sure, I have to verify: Henri Bosco, born in 1888, died in 1976, and, yes, a French writer. Perfect.

Now I just need to formulate the response in the correct format and make sure it all aligns with what was requested.
