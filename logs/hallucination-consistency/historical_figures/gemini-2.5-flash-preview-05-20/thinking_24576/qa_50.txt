Okay, let's see. The request is for a historical figure with a specific birth year, death year, and profession. The criteria are quite precise, so it should be a straightforward search.

First, I need to consider the key elements: born in 1622, died in 1673, and famous as a French playwright and actor. Right, 17th century French theatre is the target. Thinking through the big names... Molière immediately springs to mind, along with Racine and Corneille. The acting component usually points toward the playwrights themselves or those heavily involved with their companies.

Now for the dates. Racine's birth and death years definitely don't align. Corneille, I remember he lived a bit earlier. Let's check the specifics. Okay, Corneille doesn't fit either. Molière, though... January 15, 1622? Yes! Then, died February 17, 1673? Brilliant, that matches perfectly as well. The man was a playwright, actor, and director, so the third criterion is met.

Therefore, without a doubt, the answer is clear.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.

Molière
