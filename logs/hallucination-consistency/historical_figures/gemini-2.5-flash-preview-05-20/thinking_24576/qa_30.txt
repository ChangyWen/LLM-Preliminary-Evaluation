Okay, let's see... the request is for a historical figure, narrowed down by birth year, death year, and a description. My field is history, and I'm familiar with a lot of figures from this era, so this should be straightforward.

First, I'll zero in on the key parameters: born in 1700, died in 1755, German-born, French soldier *and* statesman. Those specifics should narrow things down considerably.

I'd probably start with a quick mental search, but I'll think through the search terms if I need to expand into a search engine. "German-born French soldier statesman" and then the date ranges, maybe even including "1700-1755" as a string, to really keep things tight. The dual nationality and the combination of military and political roles are particularly distinctive, so I'm going to leverage that in my search strategy.

A name is immediately coming to mind. It fits all the criteria perfectly. Now, the next step is to rapidly verify. Let's see... Born in 1700? Yes. Died in 1755? Absolutely. German origin? Yes, Goslar, which is definitively German. Military service in France? Marshal General of France, so definitely. And statesman? Absolutely, given his position and influence.

Alright, I've got it. The answer is confirmed. And I need to adhere to the formatting rules...

The historical figure you are referring to is Maurice de Saxe.
