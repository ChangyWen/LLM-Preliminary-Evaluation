Okay, let me break this down. The user is looking for a historical figure, and they've provided birth and death years along with a description of what they were known for. Right off the bat, I can see a problem – the "known for" phrase, "President of Chile (1911-1982)," immediately sets off alarm bells. It's *highly* unlikely someone could be president for their entire lifespan. That has to be wrong, and it's a clear sign of a misinterpretation or a clever little trick.

My initial thought is that the 1911-1982 is probably the individual's life span, and the "President of Chile" refers to the fact they were a president, somewhere in their lifetime. I’ll need to figure out who fits those dates and was president.

My mental search begins with the most obvious candidate, given the time period and my knowledge of Chilean history: Salvador Allende. He's the most well-known president from the latter half of the 20th century, and the approximate birth and death dates would fit. Quickly checking, nope, Allende's birth and death years don't align, nor does his term in office.

So, the "known for" statement is clearly conflating the person's life with their term in office. I need to look for a Chilean president born in 1911 and who died in 1982. Simple enough. A quick search for "Chilean president born 1911 died 1982" should lead me to the answer.

And there it is: **Eduardo Frei Montalva**. Born January 16, 1911, and died January 22, 1982 – perfect! He was President of Chile from 1964 to 1970. The "known for" description was confusing, using his life span, but I've cracked the code. The solution works.

The historical figure you are referring to is **Eduardo Frei Montalva**.

While the prompt states "President of Chile (1911-1982)", the dates 1911-1982 refer to his birth and death years, not his presidential term. Eduardo Frei Montalva was indeed born in 1911 and died in 1982, and he served as President of Chile from 1964 to 1970.
