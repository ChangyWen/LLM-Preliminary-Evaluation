Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to understand the request. The user wants a historical figure who fits three criteria: born in 1790, died in 1832, and is known for being a French classical scholar. They want the answer formatted on a new line at the end. Alright, that's clear.

Next, the search. My initial instinct is to combine those keywords directly: something like "French classical scholar born 1790 died 1832" or maybe narrow it down with "classical scholar 1790-1832 France." The dates are pretty specific, so that should help narrow it down.

Then I'd mentally sift through my knowledge of French scholars from that period. Immediately, a name pops into my head: **Jean-François Champollion.** The dates are key.

Now, let's check Champollion against the criteria. Born December 23, 1790? Perfect! Died March 4, 1832? Also perfect. The tricky part is "French classical scholar." Champollion is famous for deciphering hieroglyphs, which might seem to be a bit outside the box. But he *was* a classical scholar in the broadest sense. He was deeply involved in ancient languages, history, and culture, and he definitely fits the "French" part. And considering the context of the early 19th century, with the rise of Egyptology as part of a broader movement involving antiquities and classical studies, and his academic positions, he was a "classical scholar" of his time. He was a professor of history and archaeology, remember. Deciphering hieroglyphs *is* classical in context, actually, when you think about it, rooted in philology and historical methods.

Alright, Champollion it is.

Jean-François Champollion
