Okay, let's see. The user wants a French writer, born in 1783 and died in 1842, in the 19th century. Right, got it. The core of the query is the date range and the profession. The century confirms the dates.

Alright, where does my mental database go first? Let's see... Immediately, the dates are screaming *Stendhal*. Then I need to be sure, especially with a user who will know what they are talking about. Time to double-check. Let's see...

*   **Stendhal (Marie-Henri Beyle)** - *Born: January 23, 1783; Died: March 23, 1842* - Check. French, of course. Writer: novelist, essayist, critic... The Red and the Black, The Charterhouse of Parma. Yep. Those are very much works of the 19th century, and French lit at that.

Stendhal fits. Okay, everything lines up.

Stendhal
