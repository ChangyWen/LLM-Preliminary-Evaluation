*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what's going through my head. The user wants a name, a historical figure, and they've given me three things to work with: birth year, death year, and a defining characteristic – a 'Spanish painter'. Right, I'll break it down. Let's see, the key pieces of data are "Spanish painter," "1599," and "1660." Now, I need to quickly run a mental search, or if I needed to, a quick digital one. I'd probably just phrase it something like "Spanish painter born 1599 died 1660" to be sure. But honestly? From my experience, the name that *immediately* springs to mind is Diego Velázquez.

Now, let's verify. Let's lock down those dates. I'm pretty sure his birth was around 1599. Yes, that sounds right, so I'll mentally confirm the birthdate June 6, 1599. And his death, it's around 1660, right? August 6, 1660. Perfect. Then I can just double check, yes, he was indeed a Spanish painter, so that all matches. The criteria are spot on.

Now, to format the answer, the user asked for the final answer on a new line. Okay, so I'll formulate the response clearly and concisely.

The historical figure you are referring to is Diego Velázquez.
Diego Velázquez
