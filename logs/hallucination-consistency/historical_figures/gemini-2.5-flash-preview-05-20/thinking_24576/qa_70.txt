Alright, let's break this down. The user needs a historical figure, and the parameters are pretty specific. Okay, so I'm given birth year 1940, death year 1996, and they were a "Russian-American poet."  The gears in my head immediately start turning. "Russian-American poet"... that instantly screams Joseph Brodsky. Let's check the obvious. Born 1940? Yep, he was. And died in '96?  Yes, I'm almost certain. But always double-check, especially with dates. Just to be sure, Iâ€™ll mentally run through a quick verification. Brodsky, Russian poet, exiled from the Soviet Union, naturalized American citizen, wrote in both Russian and English, won the Nobel Prize... yep, all of it checks out.  Perfect fit. The years line up, the nationality and profession are spot on. Simple.

Joseph Brodsky
