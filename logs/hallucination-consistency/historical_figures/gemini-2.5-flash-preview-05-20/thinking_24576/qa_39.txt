Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a historical figure born in 1712, died in 1779, and known as a French veterinary surgeon. Hmm... "French veterinary surgeon" instantly triggers the idea of the early days of veterinary medicine, the very *establishment* of the field, really. And those dates... smack-dab in the mid-18th century, perfect timing for the Enlightenment and the rise of scientific institutions.

Now, who were the pioneers in that area? Right, the veterinary schools. Specifically, I think of Claude Bourgelat. He's the one who really *started* it all, the founder of the first veterinary school, wasn't he? And I seem to recall it was in Lyon, around... 1761? Okay, let's check the dates. Bourgelat...born in 1712, and he died... yes, 1779. Perfect! All the criteria match.

Alright, the answer is clear.

Claude Bourgelat.
