Okay, let's see. The prompt is asking for a historical figure, and I have some clues to work with: birth year, death year, and their area of expertise, which is Belarusian writing. Alright, that narrows things down significantly. First, I'll mentally process this.

Then, I'll formulate a search strategy, even if it's just in my head. Something like, "Belarusian writer 1882-1942," would work, or maybe "famous Belarusian writers born 1882 and died 1942" to cover all bases.

Based on my expertise, and without needing an actual search, my mind just goes straight to Yanka Kupala. I instantly know his work. Now, I need to double-check the facts. Born 1882? Yes. Died 1942? Correct. Belarusian writer? Absolutely. Poet, even more precisely.

Excellent. The answer is clear, and the formatting requirements are simple. I've got to remember to put the name on a new line at the very end, as per the instructions. Alright, final answer coming up.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.

The historical figure you are looking for is Yanka Kupala.
