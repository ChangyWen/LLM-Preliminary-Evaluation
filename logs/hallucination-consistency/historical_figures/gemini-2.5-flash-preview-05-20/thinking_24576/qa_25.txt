Alright, let's see. The user wants a historical figure, a classic "who am I?" game, based on a few clues. The key is the date range and the "known for" description. First, let's break down the request.

Okay, so, *born in 1713, died in 1784, and known for being a French Enlightenment philosopher and encyclopedist*. Got it.

My mind immediately starts rattling off keywords: French Enlightenment, philosopher, encyclopedist – and that specific date range. French Enlightenment… that opens a whole realm, Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu, and, of course, Diderot and d'Alembert, the usual suspects. But "encyclopedist" is the real giveaway. The *Encyclopédie*, that monumental work, points directly to Diderot and d'Alembert.

Now, the date check. Let's see… Voltaire is out. Rousseau… close on the birth, but not the death. Montesquieu? Nope. D'Alembert… 1717-1783... near, but no cigar. Wait a second… Diderot... 1713-1784! Ding, ding, ding!

Yes, Diderot! He was *the* central figure, a true philosopher and the main editor of that colossal work. And the dates fit perfectly.

Let's do a final, quick confirmation. Born 1713? Check. Died 1784? Check. French Enlightenment philosopher and encyclopedist? Absolutely.

Perfect.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Denis Diderot
