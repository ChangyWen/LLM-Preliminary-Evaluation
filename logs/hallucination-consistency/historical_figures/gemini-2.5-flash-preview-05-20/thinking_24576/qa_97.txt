Right, let's see... the task is to identify a historical figure given some basic facts. The prompt provides a birth year, a death year, and a very specific descriptor – "Italian poet (1265–1321)." Okay, so I need to find the right figure, got it.

Let's break this down. First, the keywords are the obvious ones: "Italian poet" and, critically, the dates 1265 to 1321. I need to immediately start sifting through my mental Rolodex of historical figures. Hmmm, that date range should be a pretty narrow filter.

Right, that period, and "Italian poet"… It practically jumps off the page! This is a classic, a gimme really. No need for a deep dive or complex analysis here. The answer is practically screaming at me.

So, the answer is definitively Dante Alighieri. Easy peasy.

Okay, final format, they wanted the answer separate on a new line. Got it. Time to deliver.

Dante Alighieri
