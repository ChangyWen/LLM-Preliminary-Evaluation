Okay, let's see. The request is straightforward: identify the ancient Greek philosopher born in -427 and dying in -347. Right, let's dive in. I immediately think of the usual suspects for that period: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Gotta cross-reference. First, Socrates. Hmm, I recall he was earlier... Let's check those dates... Nope, doesn't work. Okay, next. Plato... Aha! 427 BCE birth and 347 BCE death. That's remarkably close to what's given, right? Often cited as +/- a year or two. Definitely a strong contender. Now, just to be absolutely sure, let's glance at Aristotle. No, his dates are far later. And of course, Plato was a major ancient Greek philosopher – student of Socrates, teacher of Aristotle… a total cornerstone. Yep, that's the one. Now to present the answer neatly.

Plato
