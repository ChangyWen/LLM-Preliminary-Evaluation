Okay, here's what's going through my mind: The user wants a historical figure, and they've given me some pretty tight parameters. Let's break it down. First, I've got to analyze the ask. They need someone born in 1920, died in 2005, and famously known as the 264th Pope of the Catholic Church.

Alright, the "264th Pope" bit is the real key here. That's a highly specific detail, and that's what I'll latch onto first. Who was a famous pope around that time, from that era? Ah, John Paul II immediately springs to mind. He was incredibly significant and he's definitely on the right historical timeline. Let's double-check the dates, just to be absolutely certain. I know he died in the early 2000s, so let's get specific. Born in 1920 and died in 2005? Perfect!

Now, did he actually *fit* the criteria as the 264th Pope? I'm fairly certain, but a quick cross-reference, just to confirm. Yep, John Paul II was indeed the 264th Pope.

So, I've got all the pieces. I know the answer. I'm ready to formulate a response that's clear, concise, and hits all the marks. The answer is confirmed and verified and I'm going to proceed in confidence.
