Okay, let's see. The user needs a historical figure, right? Born in '49, died in '02, and they were a porn actress who later became an anti-porn activist. Interesting. The intersection of those two aspects is... well, it's a relatively unique profile.

My mind immediately jumps to one specific person. That combination of "pornographic actress" and then "anti-porn activist"... thatâ€™s very likely who I'm thinking of. Now, those dates are key. I need to verify them before I make any assumptions. I'm pretty sure this person's name... yes, it's Linda Lovelace. Let me just double-check the dates in my head. Or I might even do a quick search to be absolutely certain. 

Okay, right, Linda Susan Boreman, aka Linda Lovelace. Born January 10, 1949, and died April 22, 2002. Perfect. Those match up. And of course, she was in *Deep Throat*, the big one. And then, yes, she famously spoke out against the industry, detailing the coercion and exploitation. That's it. All the criteria align perfectly.

Linda Lovelace
