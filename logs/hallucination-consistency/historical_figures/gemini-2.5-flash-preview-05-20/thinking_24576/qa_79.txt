Alright, let's see what we have here. The prompt is asking for a name, a historical figure, and I have some clues to work with. First things first, I need to understand the request. Theyâ€™ve given me a birth year, a death year, and a key achievement to work with. I need to use this information, so I need to analyze the clues and find a matching historical figure.

Let's identify the keywords: "Norwegian explorer," that's a good starting point, and the big one: "first person to reach the South Pole." The dates are also important constraints: 1872 and 1928.

Now, from my existing knowledge of explorers and polar exploration, "first to reach the South Pole" *immediately* suggests a specific name. It's almost a reflex. I'm picturing a Norwegian explorer. Now, I need to run through a quick mental checklist. Is he Norwegian? Yes. And I need to verify those dates, just to be absolutely sure. It could be a similar figure, so the dates are key.

Okay, I have it: **Roald Amundsen**. Norwegian, achieved the South Pole first - check. Birth year, 1872, which is exactly what I was given. Death year, 1928. Yup, matches perfectly. All the pieces fit.

So the answer is Roald Amundsen. And I need to format the answer as requested:

Roald Amundsen
