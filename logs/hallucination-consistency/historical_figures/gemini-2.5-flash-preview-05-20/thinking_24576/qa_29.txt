Okay, let's see. The user wants a historical figure, a poet, specifically. Three criteria: born 1854, died 1891, 19th-century French poet who influenced modern stuff and prefigured Surrealism. Hmm... let's start associating some names. 19th-century French poet... Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Verlaine, Mallarmé, Hugo, but Hugo's much earlier. Influence on modern literature and arts? That strongly points to the Symbolists and beyond. And prefigured Surrealism? That’s a major clue – really nails it down. Rimbaud is *the* obvious precursor to Surrealism.

Now, the dates. Born 1854, died 1891. Right. Okay, let’s check. Baudelaire? No, he died way before. Verlaine? No, wrong dates. Mallarmé? Nope, again, wrong dates. Hugo is far too early. Arthur Rimbaud… born 1854, died 1891. Bingo. Match.

Next, verifying the description. “19th-century French poet”? Yup, Rimbaud checks out. "Influenced modern literature and arts"? Absolutely. He was foundational for Symbolism, Dada, Surrealism... the whole 20th century really. And "prefigured Surrealism"? Definitely. His work, especially *A Season in Hell* and *Illuminations*, are textbook examples of dream logic, experimentation, and pushing boundaries. It’s all there.

So, it's settled. Rimbaud is the answer.

Arthur Rimbaud
