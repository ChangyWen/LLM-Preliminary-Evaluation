Okay, let's see. The user needs a historical figure, and they've given me a set of criteria. First, I need to break down the request. They're looking for a specific person based on their birth year, death year, and what they were known for. Alright, that's straightforward. Now, the keywords: 1756, 1791, Austrian, Composer, Classical period. Right, that's the bread and butter of my field.

Okay, initial recall... Austrian composers, Classical period... The big names immediately pop up: Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven. Let's check the dates. Mozart... born in '56... and died in '91... That's a very promising start! Haydn... early birth, later death. And Beethoven, too late on both counts.

So, going back to Mozart... born 1756? Check. Died 1791? Check. Austrian composer of the Classical period? Absolutely. The perfect match. Confirmed.

So, the answer is obvious.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
