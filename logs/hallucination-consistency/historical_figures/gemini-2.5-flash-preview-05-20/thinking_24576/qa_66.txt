Okay, let's see. The user wants a historical figure, defined by birth and death years and what they were known for. Right. First, I need to break down the request. They're looking for someone who was born in 1932 and died in 1986. The key here is the professional descriptor: "Soviet and Russian filmmaker, writer, film editor, film theorist, and theatre and opera director." That narrows it down considerably.

I'll quickly formulate a search in my head â€“ something like, "Soviet filmmaker 1932-1986" or maybe "famous Russian film director born 1932 died 1986." My mind's already running through potential candidates... and there it is, popping up almost immediately. Andrei Tarkovsky.

Now, let's double-check my internal information. Birth year, 1932... Yep, right on. Death year, 1986. Perfect. And, of course, his profession. Yep, he fits the bill *exactly*. Soviet and Russian filmmaker, writer, film editor, theorist, theatre and opera director. No question about it.

Answer time, and I need to be precise.

Andrei Tarkovsky
