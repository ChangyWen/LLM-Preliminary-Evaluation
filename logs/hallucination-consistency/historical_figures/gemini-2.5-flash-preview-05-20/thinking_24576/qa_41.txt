Alright, let's see what we've got. The user wants a name, a historical figure, given some specific facts. First, let me break down the request. We know the parameters: birth year 1896, death year 1986, and the key role – Chilean politician and President. Okay, so I need to think "Chilean President," immediately, the years are what matters now.

Right, let's pinpoint those keywords: “Chilean,” “President,” and the dates 1896-1986. Time to formulate a search query, even if it's just mental. I can either go with a direct “Chilean President 1896-1986” in my mind or start the process of retrieving the info from the knowledge base of Chilean politics.

Now, let's sift through the possibilities. I'm quickly going through a mental roll call. Allende, nope, wrong dates, though a crucial figure. Pinochet, definitely significant, but again, wrong dates. Frei Montalva, no dice. Hmm, González Videla... getting closer but not quite. Wait a minute… the dates, the Chilean… *Jorge Alessandri Rodríguez*. Yes! The dates *perfectly* match. Born in 1896, died in 1986, and he was indeed a Chilean President.

Double-checking internally – from 1958 to 1964, yes. He fits. Okay, that's confirmed. Now, I just need to give the answer the way it's needed.

Jorge Alessandri Rodríguez
