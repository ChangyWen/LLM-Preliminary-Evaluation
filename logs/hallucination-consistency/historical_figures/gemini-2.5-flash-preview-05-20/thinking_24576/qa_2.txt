Okay, let's break this down. First, I need to parse the request. I'm looking for a specific historical figure. The constraints are very clear: born in '52, died in '01, and is known for being an English writer and humorist. The final answer goes on a new line.

Alright, the keywords are the key here. "English writer," "humorist," and the dates, 1952-2001... That instantly triggers a thought. Douglas Adams.

Now, let's quickly cross-check the information. Born in '52, and died in 2001. Specifically, February 11, 1952 and May 11, 2001. Got it. And, of course, he *is* known for being an English writer and humorist, and author of *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*. This is a slam dunk. The dates, the profession, the nationality... it's him.

Okay, the answer is simple. The answer goes on a new line.

Douglas Adams
