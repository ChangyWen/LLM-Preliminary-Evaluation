Okay, let's see. The prompt is asking for a historical figure, and it's giving me the usual clues: birth year, death year, and area of expertise. Right, got it.

First thing, let's break this down. Born in 1683, died in 1764... and French Baroque composer and music theorist. That immediately shouts out certain names, the usual suspects: Lully, maybe, but his dates are way off. Couperin? Possibly, but I'll need to double-check. More promisingly, Rameau - he's my strongest bet.

Now for the dates. Lully is definitely out, much too early. Couperin... let's see, born around the right time, but he died too early, yeah. And Rameau... 1683 to 1764? Bingo! Perfect. Okay, so the dates sync up perfectly with Rameau.

And then, the "known for" part. French Baroque composer is obviously on point, but the "music theorist" bit really solidifies it. I mean, Rameau *defined* music theory in the 18th century. His *Trait√© de l'harmonie* was ground-breaking, foundational stuff. He practically *wrote* the rules of harmony we still use.

So, Rameau's the answer. Dates, style, theory - it all fits.

The historical figure you are referring to is Jean-Philippe Rameau.
