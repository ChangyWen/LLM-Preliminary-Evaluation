Okay, let's see what we've got here. The user wants a historical figure, and I need to find someone matching specific criteria: birth year 1639, death year 1699, and they were a French dramatist. Right, simple enough.

"French dramatist"... that instantly triggers a cascade of names. Molière, Racine, Corneille... the usual suspects from that golden age of French theater. Of course, it’s the 17th century, and the birth and death dates will be the clincher.

Let’s start with Molière. Born in 1622. Nope. And died in 1673. Definitely out, dates don’t line up.

Corneille next. Ah, 1606 born... and died in 1684. Also, a miss.

Now, let’s check Racine. Ah, yes. Jean Racine. Born on December 22, 1639. And... let's see... died on April 21, 1699! Bingo! Perfectly matches the birth and death years, and he was, of course, one of the giants of French drama. He was, alongside Molière and Corneille, one of the big three of the era. Excellent.

Jean Racine
