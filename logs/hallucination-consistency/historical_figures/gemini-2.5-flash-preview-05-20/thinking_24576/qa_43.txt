Okay, let's see. The user wants a historical figure, born in 1524, died in 1580, and known as a Portuguese poet. Right, straightforward enough. My mental database, which, as an expert in this field, is pretty well-stocked, starts to churn. 1524 to 1580... that timeframe narrows things down significantly. Immediately, I'm thinking of a major figure: a 16th-century Portuguese poet. The dates are the key. I probably don't even *need* to run a search. It's practically on the tip of my tongue.

Now, let's see... 1524, 1580... Yes. It's Luís Vaz de Camões. The national poet of Portugal, author of *Os Lusíadas*. Right, gotta verify: Born in 1524? Check. Died in 1580? Absolutely. Portuguese poet? The quintessential one! Okay, I've got it. The answer is ready. All that's left is to output the name, formatted as requested, on a new line. Perfect.
