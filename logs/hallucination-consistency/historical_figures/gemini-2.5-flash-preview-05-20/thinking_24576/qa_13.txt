Okay, here we go. Let's break this down. The user needs a name, a historical figure, and they've given me three solid clues. Right, so, first things first, I need to isolate those crucial keywords. "Chilean politician," "former president," and those crucial date ranges – 1918 to 2016. That's the core. Now, my mind starts the internal search process. I immediately go to "Chilean president born 1918 died 2016" – yeah, that should do it.

The first name that leaps to mind is... Patricio Aylwin. Now, I've got to verify that. Let's check the dates. Yep, born in 1918, check. And died in 2016. Perfect. And, Patricio Aylwin *was* the first president after the Pinochet regime. Yep, he checks all the boxes.

Okay, seems like it's a slam dunk. No need for further refinement. It's a unique match. I'll just format the answer clearly.

Patricio Aylwin
