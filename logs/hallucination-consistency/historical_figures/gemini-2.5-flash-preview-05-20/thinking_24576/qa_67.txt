Okay, let's see. The request is pretty straightforward. They want a name, a historical figure, fitting some specific parameters. First, the birth and death years are critical – 1879 to 1953. That range immediately triggers a memory. And the description… Soviet politician, General Secretary, Premier… Okay, I'm zeroing in.

Right away, those dates and the positions scream *one* person. The key figures in Soviet leadership are pretty well-etched in my memory. I'm pulling up the relevant files now, cross-referencing my existing knowledge. Ah, yes. There's the slight issue with the birth year. I always remember Stalin's birth date being a bit fuzzy, a point of historical debate, even. While it's usually listed as 1878, the prompt *specifically* says 1879, and then mentions "(1878-1953)" in the descriptive text, which is often the case. Given the description, which clearly matches, it's a bit of a red herring. The core information matches. The roles match. The death year is spot on. Clearly, this refers to Joseph Stalin. The 1879 is the specified date in the prompt, and the "(1878-1953)" in the description confirms the correct person. All the other pieces fit. He *was* the guy. Let's verify quickly: dates match, roles match. It's Stalin.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.

Joseph Stalin
