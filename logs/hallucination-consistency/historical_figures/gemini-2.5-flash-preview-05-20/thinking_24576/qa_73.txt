Okay, let's see. The user wants me to identify a historical figure. They've given me pretty clear parameters: birth in 1867, death in 1935, and they're specifically highlighting a Polish politician, First Marshal, and Prime Minister. Alright, so I need to hone in on those key descriptors. "Polish politician," "First Marshal" - that narrows it down significantly. Combining that with the timeframe of 1867-1935... well, that's practically a flashing neon sign pointing to a specific individual in my knowledge base. Without a doubt, the answer has to be...

Józef Piłsudski
