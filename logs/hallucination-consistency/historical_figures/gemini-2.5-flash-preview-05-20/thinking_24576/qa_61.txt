Okay, let's break this down. The request is for a historical figure, a Russian author, born in 1891 and died in 1940. Simple enough.

First, I need to brainstorm, to get the mental wheels turning. Russian authors from the early to mid-20th century... I immediately start running through a mental list. Chekhov? Too early. Tolstoy? Also too early. Dostoevsky? Definitely too early. Okay, let's get into the 20th century. Gorky... hmmm, close on the date, but not quite. Mayakovsky... hmm, even closer on the dates, but still not a perfect match. Pasternak? Born around that time, but died much later. Akhmatova? Again, a bit off on the dates. Mandelstam? Born in 1891, hmmm, but died in '38, so no. Wait a minute... Bulgakov! Yes, *Mikhail Bulgakov*.

Now, let me quickly verify. Born in 1891? Yes. Died in 1940? Yes. Known for being a Russian author? Absolutely! *The Master and Margarita*, *Heart of a Dog*, *A Young Doctor's Notebook*... all classics.

Just to be thorough, I'll quickly check in my memory if there's someone else that fits *perfectly*. Unlikely, given the specific constraints.

Alright, the answer is clear. Iâ€™m confident.

Mikhail Bulgakov
