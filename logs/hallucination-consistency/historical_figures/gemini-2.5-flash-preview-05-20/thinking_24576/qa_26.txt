Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a historical figure, and the parameters are pretty specific: born in '21, dead in '81, and famous for being a French singer-songwriter and poet. Hmm, that's a good starting point. Time to run through some possibilities.

"French singer-songwriter and poet"... instantly, I think of Piaf, but the dates are off. Aznavour? No. Brel? Nope, Belgian and the dates... Brassens is a strong possibility. Iâ€™m leaning that way. Let's double-check the dates for Brassens. Born in '21, October 22nd, if I recall. And he passed away, yes, October '81. Right on the cusp there. 

And the profession... Absolutely. Brassens *is* that. Classic French singer-songwriter and poet. His lyrics were exceptionally well-written, filled with wit and often a philosophical bent.

Looks like a perfect match. Yep, it is.

Georges Brassens
