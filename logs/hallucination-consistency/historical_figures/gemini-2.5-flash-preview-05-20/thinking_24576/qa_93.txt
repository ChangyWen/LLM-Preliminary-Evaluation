Alright, let's see what we've got here. The user wants a name, a historical figure's name. The criteria are very specific, so that's good. Born in 1707, died in 1778, and known for being a Swedish botanist, physician, *and* zoologist. Okay, so I need to narrow this down.

Let's pull out the key phrases: dates are 1707-1778, Swedish, botanist, physician, zoologist.

Immediately, that combination of fields and the dates... I don't even think I need to look anything up. My brain is practically screaming the answer. I'd mentally run a query – something like "Swedish botanist physician zoologist 1707 1778," or maybe "famous Swedish botanist 18th century" – but I don't need to.

I'm thinking about one person, specifically. Let me just double-check though. Is he Swedish? Yep. Was he a botanist, physician, *and* zoologist? He pretty much *defined* the system of classification we still use, so absolutely. And the dates... Let me just... yeah, born 1707, died 1778. Confirmed.

So, the answer is...
Carl Linnaeus
