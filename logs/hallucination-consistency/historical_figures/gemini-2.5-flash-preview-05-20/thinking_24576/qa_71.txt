Okay, let's see... the request is for a historical figure, based on a few facts. Hmm, let me break this down. The parameters are: birth year -384, death year -322, and they were an ancient Greek philosopher. Right. Okay, that's straightforward.

First, I'll run through the major players in the ancient Greek philosophy scene. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Thales, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Zeno of Elea, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Epicurus, and Zeno of Citium... got it.

Now, the key here is going to be the dates. Let's filter. Okay, Socrates is out - wrong dates. Plato, no, not the right dates. Hmm… wait a minute… Aristotle… born 384 BCE, died 322 BCE... Bingo! Those dates are spot on.

Just to be sure, I should quickly confirm that Aristotle actually *was* an ancient Greek philosopher. Absolutely. He *is* a foundational figure.

Alright, I think we have a winner.

And as requested, the answer goes on a new line at the end.

Aristotle
