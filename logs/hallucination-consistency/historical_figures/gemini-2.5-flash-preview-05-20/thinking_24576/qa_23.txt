Okay, let's see. The request is for a historical figure, a name only, meeting specific criteria. Right, born in '34, died in '96, and known for being an American astrophysicist, cosmologist, author, and science educator. Hmm, easy enough. "American astrophysicist, cosmologist, author and science educator"... that immediately screams one name to me. And, the dates... they align perfectly.

Now, let me just do a quick mental run-through to make sure. Was this person *actually* American, an astrophysicist, and a cosmologist? Yes, check, check, and check. Author? Of course, seminal works. And a science educator? The epitome of the genre, practically. Born in '34... yes. Died in '96... absolutely. Okay, confirmed.

Therefore, the answer is:

Carl Sagan
