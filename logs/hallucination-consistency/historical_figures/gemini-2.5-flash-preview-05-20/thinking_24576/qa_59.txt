Okay, let's see. The request is for a historical figure, specifically a Chilean politician, based on their birth and death years. 1898 to 1980. Right, I'll need to pinpoint the right individual.

First, I focus on the keywords: "Chilean politician" and the timeframe, 1898-1980. My mind immediately jumps to Salvador Allende – *of course*. But wait...born 1908. Died 1973. Nope, incorrect dates. That was too easy. I need to be more precise, checking the dates again. 1898 and 1980.

Okay, back to it. A mental search. "Chilean politician born 1898, died 1980." Or maybe "famous Chilean politician 1898-1980". Hmm...Eduardo Frei Montalva comes to mind, but his dates don't *quite* fit the birth and death, though he was important. I need to cast a wider net, checking my mental library.

I will need to broaden my search. Maybe not *the* most famous, but a prominent politician. "Chilean president born 1898 died 1980"? "Chilean politician, dates 1898-1980"? I need to consider less famous options, or maybe someone who held other key political roles within the given timeframe. Maybe a broader search... a list of Chilean politicians by birth year or term might help.

Wait a minute... *ding*. Gabriel González Videla. Let's verify. Born November 22, 1898. Died August 22, 1980. Perfect! And he was President of Chile from 1946 to 1952. A politician, without a doubt. The dates are spot on, and the description fits perfectly.

Therefore, the answer is:
Gabriel González Videla
