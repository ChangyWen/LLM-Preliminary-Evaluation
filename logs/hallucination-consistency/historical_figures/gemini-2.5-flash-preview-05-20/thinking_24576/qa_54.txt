Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a historical figure: born in 1606, died in 1684, and famous for being a French tragedian. Right, standard biographical query. First things first, let's get the brain engaged. "French tragedian"... my mind immediately jumps to Corneille, Racine, and Molière. 17th-century French drama, that's the key period. Now, the crucial part: the dates. I've got to confirm the birth and death years. Let's see… Corneille, born 1606, died… yes, 1684! *Le Cid*, *Horace*, all those great plays – he's definitely the one. Racine, I think his dates are later, and Molière, while brilliant, he leaned more towards comedy, plus his dates won't match. Okay, let's verify. Racine was born in the 30s... no, too late. Moliere - I'm sure he's the wrong era. So, Corneille it is, undoubtedly. Perfect match on all counts. Now to formulate the answer, nice and clean. And, according to instructions...

Pierre Corneille
