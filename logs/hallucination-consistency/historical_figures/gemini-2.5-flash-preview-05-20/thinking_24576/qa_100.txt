Okay, let's see. The user wants a historical figure, based on three things. First, a birth year of 1803. Then, they died in 1869. And finally, their claim to fame is as a French Romantic composer. Alright, straightforward.

Immediately, "French Romantic composer" kicks off the usual suspects – Berlioz, Chopin, Liszt... maybe even later figures like Bizet. The year span, though, that’s the real constraint. That's the first filter.

Let's run through them. Berlioz – Hector Berlioz. Born December 11, 1803? Bingo. Died March 8, 1869? Nailed it. And, yes, *French Romantic composer*. Perfect. That's likely the one.

Chopin? Ah, but he was born in 1810. Wrong decade. Discard. Liszt? Born 1811. Strike two. Bizet? Born 1838. Nope.

Right, so the answer has to be Berlioz. Fits everything. Confirmed.

Hector Berlioz
