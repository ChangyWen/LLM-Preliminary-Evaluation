Okay, let me see... the prompt requires me to identify a historical figure based on a set of criteria. I'm being asked to perform a targeted retrieval, essentially. First, I need to break down the request. It specifies the birth and death years, a description, and demands a specific output format – the name alone, on a separate line.

Alright, let's analyze the crucial elements here. Austrian-born, German politician, chancellor and *Führer* – that's the key – of Germany, and leader of the Nazi Party.  The date range confirms it. I don't even need to consider other possibilities; the convergence of those descriptors is incredibly specific. My mind instantly jumps to the answer, the most infamous individual who fits that profile.

So, the response is clear. I need to formulate the answer, and then adhere to the required output format. Easy.

Adolf Hitler
