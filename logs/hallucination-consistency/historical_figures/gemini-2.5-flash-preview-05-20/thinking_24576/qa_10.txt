Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a name, a historical figure. Right, got it. The parameters are: born 1541, died 1614, and their claim to fame? Greek painter, sculptor, and architect.

"Greek painter, sculptor, architect"... that's ringing bells. El Greco! That's the first name that jumps to mind. Now, are the dates right? 1541 to 1614... hmm. Best to quickly verify. I can run through the details in my head, quickly confirm his origin â€“ Cretan, then Spain, and his significant roles as a painter, sculptor, and architect, all fitting the description, or if needed, I can quickly glance at an online resource to be sure.

Yes, that's it, El Greco. Born 1541, died 1614. Fits perfectly. Time to format the answer and deliver it.
El Greco
