Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a historical figure - simple enough. The criteria are specific, which helps. Born in 1844, died in 1896, and a French poet. Right, so 19th-century French poetry, I'm thinking. Let's see... what movements were active then? Symbolism, definitely. Decadence, Parnassianism... Baudelaire's too early. Verlaine, Rimbaud, Mallarmé, Hugo... those names come to mind.

Now, let's run the dates. Baudelaire: no. Hugo: no. Verlaine... aha! Born 1844, died 1896 - spot on! Rimbaud: wrong birth year. Mallarmé... close, but Verlaine's a perfect fit.

Time to confirm: Verlaine *is* a major figure in French poetry. Specifically, the Symbolist movement, just as I expected. Excellent.

Now, the answer: Verlaine. All the criteria are met. And I've put it on a new line. That should be it.

Paul Verlaine
