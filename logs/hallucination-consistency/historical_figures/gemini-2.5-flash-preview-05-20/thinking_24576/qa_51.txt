Okay, let's see. The request is for a historical figure and there are three key pieces of information here. They want someone born in 1564, died in 1616, and known as an 'English playwright and poet'. Right, right. Now, that timeline... 1564 to 1616... that's the sweet spot, the heart of the Elizabethan and early Jacobean eras. And 'English playwright and poet' - that's a very strong indicator. Thinking about the big names of that period... the answer just leaps out at me. It's practically a no-brainer. The most famous English playwright and poet within that time frame is, undeniably... I need to make sure, though. Was his birth year 1564? I believe it was. And the death year? 1616, I'm almost certain of it. Yes! Now, to check the facts... William Shakespeare, born 1564, died 1616... known for English plays and poetry? Undeniably. Perfect.

William Shakespeare
