Okay, let's see. The task is to identify a Dutch writer, born in 1927, who passed away in 2010. Simple enough. First, I'll break down the request. We need a historical figure, specifically a Dutch writer, and we have precise date parameters: 1927 birth, 2010 death.

My search strategy will be straightforward. I'll start with a basic keyword query, probably "Dutch writer born 1927 died 2010" – that’s the most direct approach. I'll immediately follow that up with some variations, just in case. Perhaps "famous Dutch writer 1927-2010" or even a query like "list of Dutch writers by birth year 1927" if the direct search doesn’t yield a quick result.

Now, let’s run that search, either in my head or, if necessary, through a quick digital query. Ah, yes, just as expected... that search should bring up Hella S. Haasse immediately.

Time to verify the information. I need to confirm the details to ensure accuracy. Let me see... Hella S. Haasse. Birth date: February 2, 1927. Check. Death date: September 29, 2010. Check. And of course, the nationality: Dutch. Check. Profession: Writer – novelist, essayist, poet. Again, check. That’s the correct individual.

Alright, the answer is clear. I'll simply formulate the response as the name of the historical figure.

And finally, per the instructions, I need to format the output as a new line at the end.

Hella S. Haasse
