Okay, let's break this down. The prompt asks for the name of a historical figure, and it provides a few clues. First, I need to understand what's being asked. Essentially, I'm given three things: a birth year, a death year, and a description. It's a classic identification problem. My brain instantly starts filtering.

Now, the core is the information: 1802-1885, and a French writer who did poetry, novels, and plays. Right away, the dates are key, so I will focus on those. And then, it needs to be a *French* writer. With those constraints, the name practically leaps out.

Victor Hugo. The dates line up exactly. Born in 1802, died in 1885. Perfect match there. And then, thinking about his *oeuvre*... poetry, absolutely (*Les Contemplations*, tons of it). Novels, of course (*Les Mis√©rables*, *The Hunchback of Notre-Dame*... the list goes on). Plays... Yes, he was a major playwright (*Hernani*, *Ruy Blas*). He hit all three marks. No question in my mind.

The answer is clear, and I have it. So, I'll provide the answer now in the required format, on a separate line.

Victor Hugo
