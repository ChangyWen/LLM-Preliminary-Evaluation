Okay, let's see. The user needs a name, and they've given me a few constraints. Right, so:

First things first, I've got to break down the request. They want a name – easy enough. But it's based on *three* specific facts. Alright, let's see: birth year 1917, death year 1984, and "Indian Prime Minister and politician" as the claim to fame.

Right off the bat, "Indian Prime Minister" throws up a few flags. We're talking Nehru, definitely Indira Gandhi, her son Rajiv, maybe even Modi, depending on how long they're going back. The dates, though, that's the real key. 1917 to 1984.

Now the filters go on. Nehru's out – he was born way earlier. Let's zero in on the most obvious candidate. Hmm, Indira Gandhi... Now let's see...Born in *1917*? Okay, that looks promising. And... October 31st, *1984*? Bingo! And she was indeed Prime Minister. That fits like a glove. Rajiv Gandhi, no, born too late. Most of the others are either too early or too late. This is an open-and-shut case.

Yep, that's it. I'm confident.

Indira Gandhi
