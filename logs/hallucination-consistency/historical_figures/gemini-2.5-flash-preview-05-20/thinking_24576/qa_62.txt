Okay, let's see. The user wants a historical figure, huh? Right, I see the specifics – birth around 1360, death around 1428, and they were a medieval Russian artist. Alright, that narrows it down pretty quickly. My mind immediately jumps to "medieval Russian artist" – that practically *screams* Andrei Rublev. Now, let me quickly double-check the dates. 1360 birth... yes, that aligns with the estimates. And 1428 death... correct again. Perfect. Rublev is, without a doubt, *the* preeminent medieval Russian icon painter. He absolutely fits the "known for" criteria. Okay, so I need to formulate the answer now and put it on a new line.

Andrei Rublev
