*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's see. The request is straightforward: identify a historical figure given birth and death dates, and a profession. Right, 1785-1873, Italian poet and novelist... hmm. Let me quickly formulate a mental query. "Italian poet novelist, 1785 to 1873" or maybe even "Who was born in 1785 and died in 1873, Italian poet?". Alright, let's sift through the mental library. Immediately, the name Alessandro Manzoni pops into focus. Now, let's just quickly verify... Manzoni, 1785, check. 1873, also check. Italian poet and novelist... indeed, and of course, *I Promessi Sposi*, his most famous work. That fits perfectly.

Alessandro Manzoni
