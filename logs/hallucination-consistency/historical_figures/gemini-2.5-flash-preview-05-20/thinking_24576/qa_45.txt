*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a historical figure, and I've got to nail this. First, the requirements: born in '99, died in '43, and known for being a French resistance fighter and a civil servant. Alright, that's a good starting point.

Immediately, my mind jumps to the obvious: Jean Moulin. He’s the classic choice, but I need to verify before offering anything up. I’ll quickly mentally sort through some potential candidates. *French Resistance...* Moulin, yes, but also De Gaulle, d'Estienne d'Orves... and then there's Brossolette, but the dates are crucial.

Now for the date filtering: 1899 birth... and death in 1943. This is really narrowing things down. It suggests someone involved in the war and probably a direct casualty of their activities. The 'civil servant' part is key. That'll set the contenders apart. I need to remember figures who were bureaucrats *before* taking up arms.

My search strategy: I'll start with "French resistance fighter born 1899 died 1943," and also "Civil servant French resistance 1899-1943." A quick mental check or maybe a glance at a search engine should confirm my suspicion.

Right, let's confirm the details. *Jean Moulin...* Born June 20, 1899. Yes. Died July 8, 1943. Yes. His role? Prefect before the war. Boom, civil servant. Then, he became a vital leader in the Resistance, aligning various groups with De Gaulle. Captured and died at the hands of Barbie. That's it! Everything perfectly aligns with the criteria: resistance fighter *and* civil servant.

The answer is:

Jean Moulin
