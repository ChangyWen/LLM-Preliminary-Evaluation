Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a historical figure based on birth and death dates, as well as a specific field of expertise. First, the criteria: born in 1842, died in 1898, and known for being a French Symbolist poet. Alright, my mind immediately starts ticking through the usual suspects: Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Verlaine, Mallarmé – those are the core Symbolists I would begin with, along with figures like Hugo, Lamartine, Musset, and Vigny, who all predate Symbolism but might be related to this request.

Now I need to filter by the dates. Baudelaire is out, too early. Rimbaud too, later dates. Mallarmé… hmm, 1842-1898? That's promising! And Verlaine's close with 1844-1896, but that doesn't quite fit the requested year of birth. Hugo is definitely out, too early by several decades. Okay, so Mallarmé is looking like the frontrunner.

Let me just confirm the "French Symbolist poet" aspect. Mallarmé, yes, absolutely. He *is* a central figure, often considered the most influential. He practically *defined* French Symbolism. His work is the cornerstone.

Right, let's double-check those dates. Born in 1842? Yes, specifically March 18th, 1842. Died in 1898? Yes, September 9th, 1898. And the poetry? Undeniably a French Symbolist.

Perfect.

Stéphane Mallarmé
