Okay, let's see what we've got here. The user wants a historical figure. The parameters are pretty clear: born in 1935, died in 1977, and known as an American singer and actor. Alright, let's break this down. Those dates are quite a tight window, which should make this a relatively straightforward query.

The phrase "American singer and actor" is rather broad, but when you marry that with the birth and death years, things tighten up considerably. My mind immediately starts running through the major players in that timeframe. I'm going to lean on my internal knowledge base here; I've got a pretty comprehensive understanding of these eras.

Wait a second…1935 to 1977... Those dates... they practically *scream* one name. Without a doubt, the immediate candidate is leaping to the forefront.

Now, I'll quickly check the details. Born in 1935? Yep, I'm pretty sure that's correct. And, of course, died in 1977? Yes, I recall the circumstances well. And, finally, was he a singer and actor? Undeniably. He practically *defined* the archetype.

Okay, that seems to be it. Confirmed.
