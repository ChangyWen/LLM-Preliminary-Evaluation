Alright, let's see what we have here. Someone wants me to identify a historical figure based on a few key facts. Okay, first things first, I need to break down the request. They've given me birth and death years, along with a description: "Chilean army officer and political figure." Interesting.

Now, the search query. What's the most efficient way to approach this? Hmm… I could go with something direct, like "Chilean army officer political figure 1877 1960," or maybe try a bit more specific, "Chilean general 1877 1960." Let's see what my mental… or perhaps, simulated… search yields.

*Clicking through the knowledge base*, I scan the possibilities. Immediately, a likely candidate pops up. The name is… Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. Born in 1877, and died in 1960. Perfect. And as for the description... he was a Chilean army officer, right? And he also served as President of Chile, *twice*! That certainly fits the "political figure" part.

Okay, time to meticulously double-check those dates. 1877 to 1960. Correct. And the description is spot on. Chilean army officer, and a significant political figure.

Alright, I have my answer, ready to be delivered.

Carlos Ibáñez del Campo
