Okay, let's see. The task is to identify a historical figure. The clues are: born in 1807, died in 1887, and was a "German philosopher, writer, and politician." Right, so I immediately zero in on the dates—1807 to 1887—that's my primary filter. I start by running through the usual suspects in my mental Rolodex of 19th-century German thinkers. 

Hmm, Marx? No, wrong dates. Engels? Nope. Schopenhauer? Definitely not. Hegel? Too early. Goethe? Way too early. Heine? No, wrong dates. Freytag? No, wrong dates. Fichte? Way off. Strauss? Close on the birth year, but not the death. Feuerbach? Similar issue. Ruge? Closer, but still wrong dates. I need someone who matches *precisely*.

The "politician" aspect is crucial, and I need to refine my search. Okay, let's think broader. What are the key figures who bridge those dates and fit the description? I am still drawn to the notion of a truly *famous* figure. I review my notes. Heine, close, but incorrect dates. Wait a minute - how about a direct search? "German philosopher writer politician 1807-1887". That's it.

The search... *ah-ha!* The most prominent person who comes immediately to mind is actually *not* exactly the most typical name, but it fits the criteria: **Robert von Mohl**. Born August 17, 1807, died February 12, 1887. Okay, checking him now. A German jurist, statesman, and political scientist, he’s described as a "liberal politician" and often as a "writer" on political science. Bingo! "Philosopher" may be a bit of a stretch, but his work on political theory and state law certainly aligns with the intellectual sphere, especially in that period where philosophy often encompassed legal and political thought. He was a professor, a member of the Frankfurt Parliament, and a diplomat.

Alright, let's cross-reference. Any other possibilities? Not really, those dates are *very* tight. Strauss and Feuerbach—both too early and not as strong on the politician aspect.

Yes, **Robert von Mohl**—born in 1807, died in 1887. He was a German jurist, statesman, and political scientist, all the essential components. The answer must be **Robert von Mohl**.
