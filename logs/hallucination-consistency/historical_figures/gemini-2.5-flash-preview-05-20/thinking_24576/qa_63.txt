Okay, let's see. The request is straightforward: identify a historical figure given some biographical data. Alright, first I need to break down what I've got.

"Born 1879, Died 1941, Known for: Chilean politician and President (1879-1941)." Right. Clearly, we're dealing with someone Chilean, a president and politician, and the date range is the critical clue – the "(1879-1941)" is almost certainly a lifespan indicator. That makes it almost too easy, actually.

I instantly gravitate towards Chilean political history of that period. Time to mentally sift through the major figures. Let's see… my internal "Rolodex" of notable Chilean Presidents is whirring. If I were using a search engine, I'd probably type in something like "Chilean President 1879-1941" or maybe "Chilean Presidents born 1879 died 1941." That should narrow it down *very* quickly.

Ah yes, I've got it. Let's just confirm the details... born in 1879… died in 1941… and a Chilean politician and President of the right timeframe. That's absolutely correct.

Arturo Alessandri Palma.
