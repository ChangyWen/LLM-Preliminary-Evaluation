Okay, here's what I'm thinking: The user wants a historical figure, specifically one born in 1908, died in 1991, and was an American physicist and engineer. Right. Let's see, I'll need to whip up a query in my head. Something like, "American physicist engineer born 1908 died 1991," or perhaps "physicist 1908-1991" would do the trick. *Immediately*, the name John Bardeen pops into my head. Now, let's quickly run through the details. I need to verify the dates and profession. Okay, let me quickly check. John Bardeen... born May 23, 1908... died January 30, 1991... American physicist and electrical engineer, perfect. He co-invented the transistor and the BCS theory. Two Nobel Prizes. Excellent. He's a perfect match! Now, time to formulate the answer. And, finally, let's make sure it's on its own line.

John Bardeen
