Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a historical figure and has given me very specific parameters. *Born in 1822, died in 1895, and known for being a French chemist and microbiologist.* Alright, that's a neat little puzzle. The "French chemist and microbiologist" bit *immediately* makes me think of Louis Pasteur. But hold on, I need to be sure about those dates. Gotta check my mental rolodex, or perhaps a quick search to confirm those birth and death dates. Ah, yes. Pasteur... Born December 27, 1822, and died September 28, 1895. Perfect! He *is* a chemist and microbiologist, famously known for pasteurization, the development of vaccines like those for rabies and anthrax, and his work on the germ theory of disease. That's a textbook fit. Now to answer the question directly and clearly.

Louis Pasteur
