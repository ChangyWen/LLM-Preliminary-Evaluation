Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a historical figure matching specific criteria: birth year 1775, death year 1836, and known for being a French physicist and mathematician.

First thought: French physicist and mathematician in that timeframe... immediately my mind flashes through the usual suspects – Laplace, Fourier, Ampere, Fresnel, Poisson, Cauchy, Legendre, Lagrange... a solid list to start with.

Now, filter by dates. I need someone born in 1775 and dead by 1836. Right off the bat, Laplace, Fourier, Fresnel, Poisson, Cauchy, Legendre, and Lagrange are out. This leaves me with the possibility of Ampere.

Ampere… Hmmm. Let's confirm. Yes, André-Marie Ampère. Now, I need to verify the "known for" portion. Yes, definitely. Ampère is *the* guy when it comes to classical electromagnetism. The ampere, the unit of electric current, is named after him! And he also contributed to mathematics.

Okay, check the birth date. January 20, 1775. Perfect. Death date? June 10, 1836. Nailed it.

So, all the boxes are checked. The answer is clear.

André-Marie Ampère
