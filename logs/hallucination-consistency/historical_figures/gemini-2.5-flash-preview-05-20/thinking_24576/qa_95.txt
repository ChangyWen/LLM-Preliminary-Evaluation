Okay, let me break this down. The user needs a name. Let's see... they've given me a birth year, a death year, and a description. It's straightforward, really.

First things first, I need to pick out the key pieces of information. "Italian Marshal of the Air Force" and "minister," alongside the 1896-1940 timeframe. Those dates are crucial â€“ they really narrow things down.

Right away, my mind jumps to a name. It's a figure from that period, someone who was very visible. Just to be certain, I'd mentally formulate a search query: something like "Italian Marshal Air Force minister 1896-1940." Or maybe even "famous Italian air force general minister 1930s," just to broaden the net.

Okay, yes, immediately I'm thinking of *him*. Then I go through a mental checklist: Born 1896? Check. Died in 1940? Absolutely, and under tragic circumstances. He *was* the Italian Marshal of the Air Force and certainly prominent in the Regia Aeronautica, essentially the Minister of the Air Force, really. All the pieces fit perfectly.

The answer is:

Italo Balbo
