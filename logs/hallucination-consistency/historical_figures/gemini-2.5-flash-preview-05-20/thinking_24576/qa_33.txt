Okay, let's get this done. First, I need to identify a historical figure. The criteria are a birth year of 1840, a death year of 1902, and they need to be a French writer. Alright, let's see...

The combination of "French writer" and the 1840-1902 timeframe instantly conjures the late 19th-century French literary landscape. That period had some giants. If I drew a blank, I'd probably start by mentally formulating a search like, "famous French writers born 1840" or something similar, just to jog my memory.

Hmm... the first name that pops to mind, a very likely candidate, is **Émile Zola**. Born in 1840, and as I recall, he died right around the turn of the century, so that should be in the correct timeframe. Just to be sure, I'll check my mental rolodex of possibilities.

Okay, let's think… Alphonse Daudet was born in 1840, but I believe he died earlier, in the 1890s, so he won't fit the timeframe. Guy de Maupassant was later, and died too early. Jules Verne? No, he was earlier, and Anatole France was born later and died after 1902.

Right. Zola, then. Let's just confirm all of this. Émile Zola. Born April 2, 1840. Died September 29, 1902. French novelist, playwright, journalist, a key figure in the naturalism movement. Yep, everything fits perfectly.

Émile Zola
