Okay, let's break this down. The prompt asks for a historical figure, and the constraints are birth and death dates, plus a descriptor of their field. Alright, let's see... born in 1770, died in 1827, and the person was a "German classical and romantic composer." The timeframe is quite specific; the 1770-1827 period immediately screams one name to me. Now, the “German classical and romantic composer” part really solidifies it. Let's cross-reference, just to be sure: born in 1770? Yes. Died in 1827? Yep. And obviously, he was both classical and romantic, perfectly straddling those styles. The answer is clear.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Ludwig van Beethoven
