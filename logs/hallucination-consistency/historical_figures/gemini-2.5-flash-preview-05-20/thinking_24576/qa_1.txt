Alright, let's see. The request is straightforward: a historical figure given some clues. Hmm, 1732 to 1799... okay, and "1st president of the United States." Well, that's pretty much a dead giveaway. First president... I immediately go to George Washington. Let's just quickly double-check those dates, though. I seem to recall he was born in the early 1730s and died towards the end of the 1790s. Yep, 1732 to 1799. Perfect match. Alright, the answer is clear and concise.

George Washington
