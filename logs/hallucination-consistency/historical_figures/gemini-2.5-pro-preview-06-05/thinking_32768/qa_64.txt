Okay, the user's asking for a specific historical figure. Right. They've given me some hard constraints: birth year 1868, death year 1950, and that they were a Chilean politician and president. I need to formulate a search query to find the best match. Let's see... I could try "Chilean president born 1868 died 1950" or maybe "Chilean politician born 1868 died 1950."

My mental database is pinging... the likely candidate is Arturo Alessandri Palma. But let's be sure. Time to verify! I need to double-check the dates and the description. Hmm... Born December 20, 1868? Check. Died August 24, 1950? Another check! Was he a prominent Chilean politician and president? Yes, twice, actually! Excellent. All the details match perfectly.

Right, the answer is Arturo Alessandri Palma. Now, how best to present this? I need to follow the user's instructions. Start with a clear answer, then put the final answer on a new line.

The historical figure you are looking for is Arturo Alessandri Palma.
