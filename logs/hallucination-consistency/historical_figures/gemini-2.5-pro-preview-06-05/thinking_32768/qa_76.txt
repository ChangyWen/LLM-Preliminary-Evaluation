Okay, the user wants the name of a historical figure. Right. Let's see, born in 1899, died in 1986. Argentine... short story writer, essayist, poet, and translator. Hmm, the years are pretty specific, and the description, especially the "Argentine" part, narrows things down considerably. I know that period, that literary scene... I've got to pull up the right name quickly.

Let's see, a search query. "Argentine writer 1899-1986". Maybe "Argentine short story writer born 1899". Or perhaps "Argentine poet died 1986." My internal knowledge base... Bingo. It's most likely Jorge Luis Borges. I'm almost certain of it, but let me double-check the dates and the main details. Born August 24, 1899. Died June 14, 1986. Argentine, definitely. And he's incredibly well-known for short stories, essays, poetry and translations, which is exactly what the prompt specifies. That's a perfect match!

The information is so direct, so unambiguous, that there's really only one candidate here. So, the answer is clear.

The historical figure you are describing is Jorge Luis Borges.

Jorge Luis Borges
