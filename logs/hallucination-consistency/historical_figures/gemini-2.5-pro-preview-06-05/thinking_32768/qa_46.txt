Okay, the user's request is for the name of a historical figure. Let's see... The clues are: born in 69 BC, died in 30 BC, and was the last active pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt. Hmm, that's pretty specific. Dates and the title of "last active pharaoh"... that pretty much narrows it down. I instantly think of the Ptolemaic dynasty â€“ that branch of Alexander the Great's empire that ended with Egypt. Who was the last ruler? Oh, right... *the* Cleopatra! Definitely. The timeline fits perfectly. She ruled roughly from 51 to 30 BC, and her life spans the precise dates provided. She was indeed the last, and a hugely significant figure during the late Roman Republic. I'll use the more formal name for accuracy, which is Cleopatra VII Philopator, but everyone just calls her Cleopatra. Then I'll follow the instructions to place the answer on a new line. Alright, here we go:

The historical figure you are describing is Cleopatra VII Philopator.
