Alright, the user needs a name, a historical figure. The constraints are clear: born in 1821, died in 1881, a Russian author. Okay, 19th-century Russian author... that narrows it down *significantly*. Gotta think... Tolstoy? Nah, dates don't match. Turgenev? Close, but no. Dostoevsky... hmm, *very* likely. Let me quickly double-check those dates... yep, born 1821, died 1881, check! Author of *Crime and Punishment* and *The Brothers Karamazov*? Absolutely. Spot on. Now, the prompt specifically wants the answer on a new line at the *end*. So, let's be precise.

The historical figure you are describing is:
Fyodor Dostoevsky
