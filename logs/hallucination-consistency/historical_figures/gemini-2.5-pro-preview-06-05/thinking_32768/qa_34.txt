Alright, let's get this done. The user wants a name â€“ a historical figure. I've got to nail this. First, the basics: born 1938, died 1980, a "Soviet singer, songwriter, poet, and actor." That's the key. Specific dates are a great start, so I'm looking at the timeline and profession. Singer-songwriter... poet... actor... Soviet... This isn't some obscure person; it's a multi-faceted artist, and the Soviet connection is critical. Okay, I've got it. Immediately, one name pops into mind: **Vladimir Vysotsky**.

I'm querying my internal knowledge base, cross-referencing those facts. Born 1938? Check. Died in 1980? Check. Singer-songwriter? Absolutely. Poet? His lyrics are legendary. Actor? Star of the Taganka Theatre and many films. Soviet? A citizen, a bard of the Soviet Union. Every detail matches. No brainer. The other option is that it's another person who fits the description as a singer-songwriter, poet, and actor, born in 1938 and died in 1980, but that would be very, very unlikely.

The user wants the final answer on a new line. So, I will be sure to give the answer in the format requested.
The historical figure you are describing is Vladimir Vysotsky.
