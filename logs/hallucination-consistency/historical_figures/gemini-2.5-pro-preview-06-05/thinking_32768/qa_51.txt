Okay, so the user is asking for the name of someone, a historical figure. I need to figure out *who*. Let's see, there are clues: born in 1564, died in 1616, and known as an English playwright and poet. Hmm, right away, I'm thinking late Elizabethan, early Jacobean period. That timeframe screams *Shakespeare*. Let's confirm, though. Born in 1564… Shakespeare fits. Died in 1616… Yep, Shakespeare again. And obviously, English playwright and poet… absolutely. Marlowe was also born in 1564, but he died way earlier. Jonson was born later. No doubt, it's Shakespeare.

William Shakespeare
