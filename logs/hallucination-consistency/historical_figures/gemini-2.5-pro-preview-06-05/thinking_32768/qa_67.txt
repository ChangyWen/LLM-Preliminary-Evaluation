*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
The user's request is to identify a historical figure based on provided clues. The clues include birth and death years and a description of their roles, including "general secretary" and "premier" of the Soviet Union. Analyzing these points to Joseph Stalin. The user's prompt even presents a subtle contradiction regarding the birth year (1878 vs. 1879), reflecting a known ambiguity about Stalin's birthdate. Since the user specifically requests the "final answer" on a new line, and the clues point definitively to Stalin, the best response is direct.

The historical figure is Joseph Stalin.

Joseph Stalin
