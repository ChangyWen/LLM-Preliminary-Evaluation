*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking: the user wants a name, a historical figure's name. They've given me some criteria: birth in 1888, death in 1976, and they need to be a French writer. Alright, my mind starts working. I know a lot about famous figures, their lifespans, and what they're known for. So, first, I'll mentally formulate a search query: something like "(birth_year: 1888) AND (death_year: 1976) AND (occupation: writer) AND (nationality: French)". Now, I'm going through my internal database, running through the likely suspects.

Camus? Nope. Sartre? No. De Beauvoir? Nada. Gide? Doesn't fit. Proust... also no. Malraux! He died in '76. Wait, born in 1901, so close, but not it. Okay, back to the drawing board. Let's try a more focused search. "French writer born 1888"... who was born that year? T.S. Eliot, no, American/British. O'Neill, playwright. Chandler, nope. Georges Bernanos... let's check those dates. Born 1888, but he died way too early. Jean Monnet, born 1888, but he's a political economist, not primarily a writer.

Okay, shifting gears. Let's try the death year. "French writer who died in 1976"... Agatha Christie, no. Malraux, again, wrong birth year. Ernst and Man Ray, no. Paul Morand... aha! Let's check the dates. 1888 birth year, and died in 1976! Bingo! Okay, I've found a match. Paul Morand fits all the criteria. Let's double-check: Born in 1888, Died in 1976. "French writer"... absolutely, that's a perfect fit. Short stories, novels, diplomatic career... the man himself.

Now, how to give the answer. The user wants the final answer *on its own line at the end*. So, it seems, I should use an identifying sentence and the name on a new line. The user already provided the key. And I am confident it's the right answer. So: "The French writer who fits that description is Paul Morand."

Paul Morand
