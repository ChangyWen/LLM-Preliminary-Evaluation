Okay, the user wants the name of a historical figure, not a treatise. Let's see... Born in 1800, died in 1849, Slovene national poet... That's pretty specific. The "Romantic poet" clue and the dates suggest the early to mid-19th century. Given my knowledge of European literature and history, "Slovene national poet" instantly makes me think of one person: France Prešeren.

Now, let's verify that with the details. Born in 1800 and died in 1849? Check. Was he the national poet of Slovenia? Yes, he is widely considered as such. His poem is the national anthem, isn't it? And, was he a Carniolan Romantic poet of Slovene descent? Yep, that fits perfectly. He was *the* guy.

So, the answer is definitely France Prešeren. Now, to give the user the name, and nothing but the name, on a new line. Okay, here goes...

That historical figure is the Carniolan Romantic poet, France Prešeren.
