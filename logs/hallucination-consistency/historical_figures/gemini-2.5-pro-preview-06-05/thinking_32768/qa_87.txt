Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a name, a historical figure's name, specifically.  I need to pinpoint this person. The clues are pretty clear, actually. Born in 1920, died in 2005, and was the 264th Pope.

Right away, the dates narrow it down considerably. That timeframe screams the 20th and early 21st centuries.  Then the Pope part... that's the key. There can only be one 264th pope. I immediately think of Pope John Paul II.

Now, I'll quickly confirm.  John Paul II. His birth year was 1920. His death in 2005. 264th Pope. Perfect. Everything matches up precisely.

I need to provide a good response, in the right format. I should probably state it as a clear identification. I'll explain it as if I was speaking. Then, on a new line, give the final answer.

So...  The historical figure who was born in 1920, died in 2005, and served as the 264th pope of the Catholic Church is Pope John Paul II.

Pope John Paul II
