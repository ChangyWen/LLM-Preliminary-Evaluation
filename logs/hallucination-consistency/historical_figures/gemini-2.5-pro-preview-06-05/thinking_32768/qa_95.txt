Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of someone. Right, let's break this down. They've given me some specifics: born 1896, died 1940. That narrows it down, a lot. And they're described as an Italian Marshal of the Air Force and minister. That's key. The dates are critical here. World War I ended in 1918. Then the rise of Fascism. And 1940...early in World War II. Hmmm... So, who fits? I'll need to recall Italian figures from that period. I'll look for someone who was an "Italian Marshal of the Air Force" who died in 1940. And, importantly, a minister. Okay, let's see... My mental database is already pinging with a name. Italo Balbo. Let's double check those facts. Born 1896, died 1940...Yep. Italian... Check. Ah, yes, Marshal of the Air Force *posthumously*. And, he was Minister of the Air Force! He fits perfectly. The description the user provided, that's spot on! The prompt is simple. The answer should be too. Let's keep it concise. I'll provide the name as the final line, as the user has requested. Perfect!

The historical figure you are describing is Italo Balbo.
