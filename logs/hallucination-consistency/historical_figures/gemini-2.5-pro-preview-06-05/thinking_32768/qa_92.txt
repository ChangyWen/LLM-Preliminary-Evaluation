Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific historical figure. Right, I'm given some clues to work with. Born in 1809, died in 1882... that's a very specific timeframe to start with. "British naturalist" - that narrows things down considerably. And then, boom, "author of 'On the Origin of Species, by means of natural selection.'" Alright, that's it. This is classic, textbook Darwin. The timeframe and the British naturalist tag just reinforce it. No doubt about it. I need to confirm that quick, but the theory of natural selection is a dead giveaway. Birth date, death date... all lines up. Yep, Charles Darwin it is. Perfect. The answer needs to be on a new line at the end, so I will make sure of that.

The historical figure you are describing is Charles Darwin.
