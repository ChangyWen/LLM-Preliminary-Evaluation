Okay, the user needs the name of a historical figure. I've got to find someone who fits specific criteria: born in 1842, died in 1898, and known as a French Symbolist poet. Right, so the dates are the immediate anchors. That timeframe, late 19th century, screams Symbolism. Baudelaire is out – wrong dates, though a vital predecessor. Verlaine? Hmm, born in '44, so close, but no cigar. Rimbaud? No, the dates don't match, even if he's a key player. Wait... Mallarmé. 1842 to 1898. Perfect! And of course, Mallarmé *is* Symbolism. He embodies it. Let's just confirm. Yes, Stéphane Mallarmé, born March 18, 1842, and died September 9, 1898. His work is all about musicality, suggestion, and complex syntax. Right, time to construct the final answer.

The historical figure who was born in 1842, died in 1898, and is known as a French Symbolist poet is Stéphane Mallarmé.
