Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a name, that much is clear. They've given me three pieces of information, essentially a historical riddle. First, I need to understand the request: identify a historical figure based on a birth year, a death year, and a description. Easy enough.

Next, let's analyze the clues. The dates are the key here: -470 to -399 BC. That's very specific, a narrow window of time. And the description "ancient Greek philosopher" tells me where and who to look for. Now, my mind leaps to the usual suspects. I immediately start listing the big names in ancient Greek philosophy: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle... I mentally run through Thales, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Zeno, Epicurus, Diogenes... I need to check their life spans against the dates.

So I start cross-referencing the candidates. Socrates, born around 470 BC, and died in 399 BC? Bingo! It's a perfect match. Plato and Aristotle are out, dates don't fit. The others are too early. 

Now I need to confirm this. The dates confirm it's Socrates. A cornerstone of Western thought. His death is a famous event. He fits the bill perfectly.

Finally, I need to formulate the answer. Direct and to the point is best. I’ll state the name and give a *very* brief explanation – the crucial bit being that the dates align. Then, I'll format it as the user requested: the answer on a new line.

I think I've got it. Time to formulate the response, making sure to adhere to the given instructions. It all hinges on those dates, really. And the knowledge, of course. I'm ready.

Socrates
