Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a historical figure. I've got the key info: born 1918, died 2016, a Chilean politician and former president. The dates are crucial here. My internal knowledge base and any quick look-up would confirm this narrows it down considerably.

I'll start by checking my memory: Allende, Pinochet... nope. Aha! Patricio Aylwin. Let's double-check those dates... yes, born 1918, died 2016. And the description matches. Eduardo Frei? No. Lagos, Bachelet, Pi√±era... nope. Aylwin it is!

The historical figure described is Patricio Aylwin.

Patricio Aylwin
