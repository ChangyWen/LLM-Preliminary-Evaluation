*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, the question is straightforward: I need to identify a historical figure. I've been given some clues: birth year 1265, death year 1321, and that they were an Italian poet. Alright, so those dates are pretty specific, and combined with "Italian poet," it's a strong signal. Now I'm digging into my internal knowledge base. Who fits that description *perfectly*? Right away, the answer screams out: Dante Alighieri. Let's verify. Was he born around 1265? Yep. Did he die in 1321? Correct. And he's *the* most famous Italian poet from that period. He wrote *The Divine Comedy*. So, the answer is definitely Dante. Now, I need to format my response. The prompt specifically asks for the final answer on a new line. So I'll state the answer clearly and then provide the requested line break.

The historical figure you are referring to is Dante Alighieri. He is the author of the epic poem 'The Divine Comedy' and is considered one of the most important figures in world literature.

Dante Alighieri
