Alright, the user wants the name of a historical figure, and they've given me some constraints: born in 1940, died in 1996, and known as a Russian-American poet. Okay, I know a bit about this area. My internal knowledge base has several well-known Russian poets, including Nabokov, but his dates don't align. Hmm... Joseph Brodsky is the most likely candidate, I seem to recall that he fits these dates. Let's double-check: born in 1940, yes. Died in 1996, check. And, yes, he was exiled from the Soviet Union and became an American citizen, making him Russian-American. Perfect fit! Now, how to formulate the answer. They want it in a specific format: the final answer on a new line at the end. Okay, I'll start with a direct sentence, and then, as requested, put the name on a new line. Let's make it concise, yet informative.
The historical figure you are describing is Joseph Brodsky.
