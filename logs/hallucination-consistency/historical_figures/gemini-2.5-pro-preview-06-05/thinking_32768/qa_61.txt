Okay, the user needs a name. It's a historical figure, and I need to nail down the criteria first. Let's see: born in 1891, died in 1940, and is a Russian author. Alright, I can work with that. I'll start by brainstorming search terms, something to get me rolling. I'll probably start with variations like "Russian author born 1891," "Russian writer 1891-1940," "Famous Russians born 1891," and maybe "Famous Russians died 1940" to cover all the bases.

Now, to execute the search - or, more likely, just tap into my knowledge base. Let's see what pops to mind first. Okay, first up, "Russian author born 1891." I can picture some of the likely results already: there's Mikhail Bulgakov, born in May of '91. Osip Mandelstam was also born in '91, in January. And Ilya Ehrenburg too. And there's Boris Pasternak, but, darn, he was born in 1890, so not quite. Prokofiev, the composer... he was born in '91, but... he's primarily a composer, not an author. Okay, that gives me a good base to start.

Now, let's also search by the death year. "Russian author died 1940" should yield a good result. Mikhail Bulgakov died in 1940! Fantastic! And Isaac Babel... yeah, executed in 1940. Vsevolod Meyerhold, the director, also died in '40, but that's not the primary focus here. Then there's Trotsky, but he was more of a revolutionary writer.

Okay, time for the cross-reference. Bulgakov... born 1891? Yes. Died 1940? Yes. Russian author? Yes. He's famous for *The Master and Margarita* and *Heart of a Dog*, among others. Definitely a strong candidate. Mandelstam was also born in 1891, but he died in 1938 - so, no. Ehrenburg... born 1891, but he died much later. Babel was born in 1894, and Trotsky in 1879, not meeting the birth year criteria. So, Bulgakov is the only one who ticks all the boxes.

So, the answer is pretty clear: Mikhail Bulgakov. Born May 15, 1891. Died March 10, 1940. Author. Done.

Time to formalize the answer. Follow the instructions and make sure the output is perfect.

Mikhail Bulgakov
