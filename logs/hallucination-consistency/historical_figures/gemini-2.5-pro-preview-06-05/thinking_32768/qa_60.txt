Okay, here's my thought process on this. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure and has provided some specific details. I know the answer - Juan Antonio Ríos. My main task is to give the name while adhering to the prompt's formatting instructions.

I started by figuring out the best search strategy to confirm my answer, as I always do. Then, I focused on how the answer should be presented. The prompt asks for the "final answer in a new line at the end of your response." This could mean just the name, but since I am supposed to be conversational, I believe providing a sentence and then putting the answer on a new line is the best approach. 

The name of the historical figure is:
Juan Antonio Ríos
