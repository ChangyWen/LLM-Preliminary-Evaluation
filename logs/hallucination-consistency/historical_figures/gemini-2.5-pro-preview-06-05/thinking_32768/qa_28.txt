Okay, let's see... the user wants a historical figure, born in 1911, died in 1982, and was the President of Chile. Hmm... the "President of Chile (1911-1982)" is a bit odd, since it's unlikely someone was president their whole life. It's probably a lifespan error. I should probably treat that as a clue, not as an actual term of office.

Right, so, let's break this down. I need a Chilean president, born in 1911, and who died in 1982. I'll start with some potential candidates. Let's see, who are the prominent Chilean presidents? Allende, Pinochet... okay, let's check the dates. Allende was born in 1908, so doesn't match. Pinochet was born in 1915, also doesn't match.

Alright, let's try a targeted search. "President of Chile born 1911". The result: Eduardo Frei Montalva. Let's verify... born January 16, 1911, and died January 22, 1982. Bingo. He was indeed President of Chile. His actual term was from 1964-1970. So the prompt's "(1911-1982)" was about his lifespan, not term in office.

So the answer is Eduardo Frei Montalva. The user's request is for just the name.

Eduardo Frei Montalva
