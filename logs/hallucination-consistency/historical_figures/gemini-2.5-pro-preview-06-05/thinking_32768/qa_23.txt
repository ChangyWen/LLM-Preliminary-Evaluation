Okay, the user's asking for the name of a historical figure. Got it. I need to find someone who fits these parameters: born in 1934, died in 1996, and known as an American astrophysicist, cosmologist, author, and science educator.

Alright, let's break this down. The dates narrow it down considerably, and the job description gives us a good profile. "Astrophysicist" and "Cosmologist" immediately point me in a particular direction: space, the universe. The "author" aspect suggests someone who wrote books, and "science educator" means they made science understandable to the general public. Hmm... combining "cosmologist," "author," and "science educator" - there's one name that leaps to mind. It's *gotta* be Carl Sagan.

Now, let's verify. Born in 1934? Yep, that's right. Died in 1996? Yes, that's right, too. An American astrophysicist, cosmologist, author, and science educator? Absolutely. He was *the* guy. His show *Cosmos* was a cultural phenomenon, his books were bestsellers. Confirmed. No other figure of that stature matches all those criteria.

The historical figure you are describing is Carl Sagan.
Carl Sagan
