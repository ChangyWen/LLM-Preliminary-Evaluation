Okay, let's see. The prompt is asking for the name of a historical figure. I need to narrow it down based on the given criteria. First, let's identify the core of the question: I need a name. Then, let's extract the key features or constraints. It looks like the person was born in 1790, died in 1832, and was known as a French classical scholar.

Now, what's the best way to find this person? I could formulate a search strategy. I could search for the most specific terms first: "French classical scholar born 1790" and "French classical scholar died 1832". I'd also combine all the criteria into one search: "French classical scholar born 1790 died 1832." I could also broaden the search and then filter: "famous French people born 1790" and filter by death year and profession. Same with "famous French people died 1832," filtering by birth year and profession.

Alright, let's start with the most specific search – "French classical scholar born 1790 died 1832". Immediately, my memory kicks in, and I'm thinking of Jean-François Champollion. But I need to verify. Let's check the dates. Champollion was born on December 23, 1790. That matches. He died on March 4, 1832. That also matches. As for his profession, yes, he was a French philologist and orientalist. He's famous for deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs. "Classical scholar" isn't the *perfect* description, but it's reasonable. He *was* a scholar of classical languages, essential to his work, and his field falls under the umbrella of broader classical studies.

Okay, so the answer is Jean-François Champollion. He fits all the criteria. He was born in 1790, died in 1832, and his work on languages aligns with the "classical scholar" description. The Rosetta Stone is his claim to fame.

Now, how should I present the answer? The prompt said to format the answer with the name on a new line. First, the identifying sentence. Then the name itself. Okay, here we go:

The historical figure you are referring to is Jean-François Champollion.
