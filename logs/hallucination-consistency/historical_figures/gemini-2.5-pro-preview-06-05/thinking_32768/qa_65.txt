Okay, let's see. The user wants a name. First, I need to understand what they're looking for. Hmm, key details... Born in 1431, died in 1463. Known for being a French poet and a criminal. Alright, the 15th century, late medieval France. A poet *and* a criminal? That's not your everyday pairing. Let's try a quick internal search. "French poet 15th century"... I see a few, but one really stands out. "French poet criminal" ... now that's much more specific. That points directly at François Villon. "Poet born 1431"... yep, Villon fits. The dates are matching well. Born around 1431. "Poet died 1463"... Ah, tricky. He *disappeared* in 1463. Likely banished, and died sometime after that. But 1463 is the critical date for identification. The details line up perfectly. French poet and criminal, born in 1431, disappeared around 1463. It's definitely François Villon. I'm confident.

The historical figure who fits that description is...
François Villon

The historical figure who fits that description is François Villon. His birth year is estimated to be 1431, and he disappeared from historical records in 1463 after being banished from Paris, so that year is often cited as his date of death. He was a celebrated French poet who was also repeatedly involved in criminal activity.
