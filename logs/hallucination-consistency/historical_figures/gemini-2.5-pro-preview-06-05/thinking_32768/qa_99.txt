Okay, let's see… the user wants a name, a specific historical figure. Right. First, I need to pull out the essential facts they've given me – the constraints. Hmm, born in 1917, died in 1984. And they're asking about an Indian Prime Minister. Okay, those years are pretty specific, and the job title narrows things down significantly. It's practically a one-shot, with those dates and that role.

Right, let's go straight to the source. I'll just query my knowledge base: "Indian Prime Minister born 1917 died 1984."  Boom. Instant hit. Indira Gandhi.  Now, let me just quickly verify. Born in 1917, check. Died in 1984, check. And of course, she *was* the Prime Minister of India, among other things. The description perfectly encapsulates her. It's a neat summary, using the birth and death years.

The question is straightforward, so I'll respond directly, following their formatting instructions.

Indira Gandhi
