Okay, the user needs the name of a historical figure. Right. Let's break down the request. I know this field; I can narrow this down quickly. The key is: French, veterinary surgeon, born in 1712, died in 1779. Hmm... That's a pretty specific set of parameters, which should make it easier to find a result.

My search strategy should be straightforward. First, a direct search: "French veterinary surgeon born 1712 died 1779." If that doesn't immediately yield a name, I'll broaden the search slightly. I know that the founding of the first veterinary school would be a significant factor. So, another query will be "founder of first veterinary school France." And finally, I'll throw in "famous French veterinarian 18th century" just in case.

Let's see... Thinking back on what I already know, I have a good hunch. Actually, just considering the dates and profession, the first search should immediately pop out the answer. Okay, let's verify the details... Yes, "French veterinary surgeon born 1712" quickly gives me... ah, *Claude Bourgelat*. Born March 27, 1712. Died January 3, 1779. Perfect. French, check. Veterinary surgeon, check. Dates match up perfectly. He's the guy. Oh, and of course, he founded the veterinary school in Lyon in 1761. Classic.

So, the answer is Claude Bourgelat. Easy as that. I'll give the user a simple, direct answer.

The historical figure who fits that description is Claude Bourgelat.
