Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user is asking for a name, a historical figure, and they've given me three pieces of information. First, they've told me the birth year is -427, meaning 427 BC. Next, the death year is -347, or 347 BC. And finally, they say the person was an "ancient Greek philosopher." 

Right away, that's a very specific set of constraints. 427 to 347 BC... that gives me a timeframe, a pretty tight one at that. And "ancient Greek philosopher" narrows it down to a well-defined group of people. Let's see, who fits? Okay, I can start rattling off names. There's Socrates, but his dates don't line up. He was a bit earlier. Aristotle... no, he's too late for this. Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, all too early.

Wait... Plato. Plato! Now, let me think. Plato lived... I believe his dates are around 428/427 BC to 348/347 BC. Bingo! That matches perfectly. The -427 birth year aligns perfectly, and the -347 death year fits too. And of course, Plato *was* an ancient Greek philosopher; the student of Socrates. This seems like it has to be Plato.

So, I'm confident. The answer is Plato.

The historical figure who fits that description is Plato.
"Plato"
