Okay, let me see what we've got here. The user wants a name, a historical figure. I need to nail down the details first. Right, born in 1803, died in 1869, and known as a French Romantic composer.

Alright, this immediately screams the Romantic era. 1803-1869 is pretty much smack dab in the middle of it, and specifically, the French school. Let's think... major French Romantics... Berlioz definitely comes to mind. Saint-SaÃ«ns is a little late, Bizet too. Gounod? Franck? Chopin, although he was Polish, did spend a lot of time in France, but his dates don't quite fit.

Berlioz is the most obvious choice. Now, let's double-check the dates. Hmm, when was he born? December 11, 1803, okay. Died... March 8, 1869. Perfect! And yes, *Symphonie fantastique* and the like, that's quintessential Romanticism. French Romantic composer, check.

So, the historical figure who matches that description is...

Hector Berlioz
