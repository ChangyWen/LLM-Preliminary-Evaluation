Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific historical figure. Right, I've got that. Let me pull out the key facts they gave me: born in 1822, died in 1895, and they were a French chemist and microbiologist. Ah, this is good. 

The dates tell me we're looking at the 19th century, which is a manageable timeframe. The really crucial part, though, is "French chemist and microbiologist." That's incredibly specific. "Chemist" and "microbiologist" together in the 1800s, and *French*? That's a pretty narrow field.

Let me run a search of my mental Rolodex... hmm, French chemists... French microbiologists... French *chemist and microbiologist* from the 19th century... Bang! The answer just pops into my head: Louis Pasteur.

Now, I need to quickly verify. Born in 1822? Yes. Died in 1895? Yes. And he was absolutely known for both chemistry and microbiology. Pasteurization, vaccines, germ theory... all central to microbiology. And his work in stereochemistry is a major contribution to chemistry, too. Fits like a glove.

Okay, so the answer is definitely Louis Pasteur. Now, I just need to give the user a clear and concise response, and follow the format instructions.

The historical figure who was born in 1822, died in 1895, and is known as a French chemist and microbiologist is Louis Pasteur.
