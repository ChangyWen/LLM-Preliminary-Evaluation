*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's break this down. The user needs the name of a historical figure. They've given some key details: birth year, death year, and a profession – French dramatist. My brain immediately starts ticking through potential candidates. Late 17th century, you know? Louis XIV. Molière is a strong possibility... but wait, the dates. Molière's dates don't align. Okay, Corneille is also out. Ah, Racine! The dates are spot-on. Born 1639, died 1699, French dramatist... it has to be Racine. Now, the formatting instructions. The user wants the final answer on a new line. I need to craft the *perfect* response. I want to be helpful and polite. I'm going to state the answer clearly in a sentence and then provide the answer by itself on a new line, just to be absolutely sure I follow the instructions. It's all about precision and clear communication, particularly when the response is likely destined for some automated system. So, let's do this: The French dramatist born in 1639 and died in 1699 is:

Jean Racine
