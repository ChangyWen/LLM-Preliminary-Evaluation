Okay, let's see. The user needs the name of a historical figure. I need to figure out who fits the description: born in 1890, died in 1974, and known as a "Russian architect and painter."

First, I'll try to bring up a name from memory. Given those dates and the profession, El Lissitzky seems like a possibility, being an avant-garde artist. Let's double-check the dates. Hmm, no, Lissitzky died in 1941. Clearly wrong.

Okay, let's try a focused search: "Russian architect and painter born 1890 died 1974". The initial search results bring up someone named Georges Annenkov, also known as Yuri Annenkov. I should check the dates and the description. Born 1889, not 1890. Died in 1974. And yes, he's known as a painter, with some design work. The description says "architect", but maybe thatâ€™s a generalization, perhaps related to his stage design. Hmm.

Let's try a slightly different approach. Let me broaden the search to just "artist born 1890 died 1974", and then narrow it down. Well, Man Ray is there, but he's not Russian. Ossip Zadkine is a sculptor, not exactly a painter or architect. Back to Annenkov. The birth year discrepancy is a bit annoying, but Annenkov is the closest.

Right. Let's try the user's exact wording: "Russian architect and painter (1890-1974)". Doing that search, wow, that specific phrase pops up in a ton of quizzes, crossword clues, and biographical sources. The answer *everywhere* is Georges Annenkov! Okay, so the birth year is probably slightly off in whatever the source for the question is, but the name is the direct answer.

So, even with the slight birth year issue, and the "architect" thing being a little loose, that's the answer. The user is probably looking for the trivia answer specifically. The specific prompt points to him.

Georges Annenkov
