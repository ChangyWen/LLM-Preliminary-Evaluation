Okay, let's see. The user wants a name. Right. My task is to identify a specific historical figure. I need to understand the request.

The key here is the criteria they've given me: born in 1879, died in 1954, and an "Australian writer and feminist." That's a very specific set of parameters, actually. Let me think about how I'd approach this.

First, I could formulate some search terms. "Australian writer feminist born 1879" would be a good start. Or, maybe "Australian writer died 1954." Or, to streamline it, "Australian writer feminist 1879-1954". That covers the entire time frame.

Now, time to tap into my knowledge base. Immediately, the name "Miles Franklin" pops into my head. Let's see if the details line up. Right, I think she was born in... 1879? And died around… 1954, I believe. Let's confirm. I'll check the dates - born October 17, 1879, and died September 19, 1954. Excellent!

And, of course, the description. Was she an "Australian writer and feminist?" Absolutely. *My Brilliant Career* is a cornerstone of Australian feminist literature, and the Miles Franklin Award is, of course, named after her. 

Birth year: 1879. Check. Death year: 1954. Check. Description: "Australian writer and feminist." Check and check.

So, putting it all together… I think I've got it.

The historical figure who fits that description is Miles Franklin.
