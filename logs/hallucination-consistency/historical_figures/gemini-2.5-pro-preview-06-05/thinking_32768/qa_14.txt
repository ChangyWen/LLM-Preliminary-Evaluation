*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. Someone's asking for a name. Specifically, a historical figure. Right. Let's see... I need to identify who this person is. The clues I have are the birth year, the death year, and the title "king of France". Alright, that's pretty specific, actually.

I'll start by breaking this down. 1214 to 1270 - those dates are crucial, that's going to be the key. And "king of France"...that really narrows down the possibilities, even though the French monarchy is, of course, a *long* and complex thing. I'll think about what I already know: I'll search my internal knowledge for anyone who fits those criteria. 

First, I could just do a quick search in my mental library: "King of France born 1214". I'm already picturing Louis IX. Or maybe "King of France died 1270". Hmm... still Louis IX comes to mind. Or, I could go broader, "French monarchs 13th century" and then filter the results by the birth and death dates. I think I should cross-reference whatever I find to be sure. 

So, I'll go with "King of France born 1214". Oh yes, it's Louis IX of France. Let me double check the details just to be sure. Then I'll check "King of France died 1270". Aha, that's Louis IX again. He died on the Eighth Crusade, during the siege of Tunis. That matches. Now, let's look at "French monarchs 13th century" to check. Alright, let's see: Philip II, Louis VIII, Louis IX, and Philip III. Right.

Philip II...No. 1165-1223. Not him.
Louis VIII...Still no. 1187-1226.
Ah, here we go! **Louis IX (1214-1270)**! Nailed it.
Philip III...No, not him. 1245-1285.

Okay, the answer's clear. It's Louis IX. Also known as Saint Louis, though that is not really asked for in the prompt.

The historical figure who was born in 1214, died in 1270, and was a king of France is Louis IX.
