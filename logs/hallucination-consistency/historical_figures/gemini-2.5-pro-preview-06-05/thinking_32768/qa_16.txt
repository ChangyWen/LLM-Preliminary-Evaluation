*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the name of a specific historical figure. First, I need to break down the request. The clues are: birth year, death year, "Spanish princess", "saint", and "queen consort of France."

The dates, 1188 to 1252, are crucial. That places the person in the High Middle Ages. "Spanish princess" means from one of the kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula. The "saint" part is a bit tricky. It *could* mean someone officially canonized by the Catholic Church, or it might be a more informal reference to their piety. "Queen consort of France" means she was married to a King of France.

So, I'll start connecting the dots. I'll think about the French kings around those dates - Louis VIII and his son, Louis IX (Saint Louis). Let me see, Louis VIII was king from 1223-1226. Now, who was his wife? Ah, yes, Blanche of Castile!

Let's check if she fits the clues. Born 1188? Yes, in Palencia, Kingdom of Castile. Died 1252? Yes, in Paris. Spanish princess? Yes, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile. Queen consort of France? Yes, married to Louis VIII. "Saint"? Hmm... No. She wasn't formally canonized. Her son, Louis IX, *is* a saint. It might be a common misunderstanding.

All the other clues fit perfectly! No other Spanish princess who became queen of France matches those dates. So, it's likely Blanche of Castile, even though the prompt's description of her as a "saint" isn't strictly accurate. I can say she's often associated with sainthood due to her piety and her son.

I'm going to give the name, and I'll mention the saintly confusion for extra clarity. The final answer will be clearly separate, as requested. This should be the best answer, perfectly addressing the user's implied information needs and the prompt formatting.

The historical figure matching those dates (1188-1252) and titles (Spanish princess, queen consort of France) is Blanche of Castile. The reference to her as a saint is likely due to her renowned piety and her status as the mother of the canonized king, Saint Louis IX.
