Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific historical figure's name. I need to get to work extracting the critical information to solve this. Right, so the key details are the birth and death years, the fact they were Polish, and the roles they held: politician, First Marshall, and Prime Minister.

My search strategy will be to start with a broad search using the birth and death years with the nationality. Then, I will look for anyone that matches the specific roles mentioned. That should narrow things down. My internal knowledge base should have this, and it's pretty thorough.

Let's see... searching my database, I'm looking for a Polish leader born in 1867 and dying in 1935. Ah, the name that immediately springs to mind is Józef Piłsudski. Now, let me just quickly verify everything. Born in 1867? Check. Died in 1935? Check. Polish? Yes. Politician, First Marshall, and Prime Minister? Indeed, he was all of those things. The roles and dates line up perfectly. The description from the request is a spot-on fit.

The user wants just the name, and on a new line at the end. Right. Simple and direct. Excellent.

The historical figure you are describing is Józef Piłsudski.
