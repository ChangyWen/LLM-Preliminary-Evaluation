Okay, let's see, the user wants a specific historical figure's name. Alright, I need to pull out the crucial details. The birth and death dates are given – 1162 to 1227. That’s a good starting point, pretty specific. Ah, and the crucial descriptor: "founder and first khan of the Mongol Empire." That narrows it down *considerably*.

Now, time to access the internal databanks… who was the *founder* of the Mongol Empire? Right, Genghis Khan. Dates… born around 1162, died in 1227. Bingo! The dates match perfectly. And the "first khan" title? Yes, that’s absolutely accurate. He was the *Great* Khan.

So, synthesize the answer. The user wants a name, so I have to give that directly. And there's a specific format requested – the answer on a new line. Okay, let's craft the response in a conversational way, a statement of confirmation first.

Final check: Does it directly answer the question? Yes. Is it correct? Absolutely. Does it meet the formatting requirements? Yep.

The historical figure you are describing is Genghis Khan.
