Okay, let's see, the user needs a Dutch writer born in 1927 and who died in 2010. Simple enough. First things first, what are we dealing with? Alright, I need a Dutch writer who meets the birth and death year parameters. Let's get the keywords down: "Dutch writer", "born 1927", and "died 2010".

I could try searching a few ways; "Dutch writers born in 1927" and "Dutch writers who died in 2010". But the most direct approach would be to combine them, right? I'll just search for "Dutch writer born 1927 died 2010". That should give me the answer right off the bat.

Okay, let me run that search query. Okay, that brought up a name. Ah yes, *Harry Mulisch* should be a good candidate. Now, I need to quickly confirm the details. Born in 1927... Yep, July 29, 1927. Perfect match. Did he die in 2010? Yes, October 30, 2010, looks like. Again, right on the money. And, of course, he was a Dutch writer. One of the most important Dutch writers post-WWII actually. Internationally known even. "The Assault", "The Discovery of Heaven"... classic stuff.

So, to be absolutely sure, I will re-iterate the question and confirm the answer:

The historical figure you are looking for is Harry Mulisch.

Harry Mulisch
