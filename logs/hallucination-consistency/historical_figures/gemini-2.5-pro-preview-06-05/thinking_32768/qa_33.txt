Okay, the user needs the name of a historical figure. I need to pull out the important details: born in 1840, died in 1902, and a French writer. Alright, that gives me some good constraints to work with.

First, I'll figure out a search strategy. I could search directly: "French writer born 1840 died 1902." Or maybe I could break it down and search by birth year and death year, or by a combination of birth year and being a French writer. The direct search seems like the most efficient approach given the specificity.

I'm going to use my mental database first; that's the quickest. "French writer born 1840 died 1902"... immediately, the name Émile Zola pops to mind. Now, let me quickly verify the facts. Yes, he was born in 1840 and died in 1902, and of course, he's known for his work as a French writer. That's a good match.

Just to be thorough, I'll quickly consider other possibilities. Are there *any* other French writers who would fit these exact dates? I could do a quick search. I'll check authors born in 1840, but I'm pretty confident Zola will be the most relevant. Yes, I see Alphonse Daudet was born in 1840, but he died earlier. I need to quickly review writers that died in 1902. No others jump out immediately.

Given the criteria, it's almost certainly Émile Zola.

Now, I need to formulate the final answer. The user just wants the name, with the answer on a new line. Hmm. I could say, "The answer is Émile Zola," but that sounds a bit conversational. I'll give a brief confirmation first, then put the name on its own line, as requested.

The historical figure you are describing is Émile Zola.
