Okay, let's see. The user wants a historical figure, a pretty straightforward request. They've given me three pieces of information: a birth year, a death year, and a general descriptor. Right, so -384 to -322, which translates to 384 BC to 322 BC, and the description is "ancient Greek philosopher." Got it.

Now, that date range is a pretty narrow window. I need to quickly think through the major players in ancient Greek philosophy. Let's run through them: Socrates, Plato, and... Aristotle.

Socratesâ€¦ wasn't that the guy who got hemlock? Yeah, his dates are way off. Plato... his life ended before the provided death year. Aha! Aristotle... Yes, *Aristotle* was born in 384 BC and died in 322 BC. Perfect match! He was also *the* philosopher of that period. He was a student of Plato, taught Alexander the Great, and is one of the cornerstones of Western thought.

Just to double-check... Yep, Aristotle's dates are indeed spot on. He fits the bill perfectly, it's him. So, I need to give the user the answer. The answer should be in the form of the name.

The historical figure who was born in 384 BC, died in 322 BC, and is known as an ancient Greek philosopher is Aristotle.

Aristotle
