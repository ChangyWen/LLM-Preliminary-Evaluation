Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of someone, so this is a direct identification task. I need to pull out the relevant data and then search my mental encyclopedia, so to speak.

Right, let's break down the clues. Born in 1642, died in 1727 – very specific dates. And the profession is "British physicist and mathematician." Okay, that's a tightly constrained search. Immediately, a few names spring to mind, but the era is screaming "Scientific Revolution." Who fits that bill from the British Isles, with those dates?

I need to cross-reference. 1642-1727… that’s a huge hint! That time frame points squarely at one particular figure. I'm pretty sure I know who this is, but let's double-check the vital details. A quick scan of my internal database... Born 1642? That's right. Died in 1727? Yep. And he was *the* British physicist and mathematician. Laws of motion, gravitation, calculus... the whole shebang. A foundational figure.

Okay, the information is all there. I’ve confirmed the dates, the description, everything. The question is "What is the name...". So, I should just go straight for the answer, right? And the instructions are specific about the format – a final answer on a new line.

The historical figure you are describing is Isaac Newton.
