Okay, let's see. The user wants a historical figure. Right, I need to find out who they are talking about. Hmm, let's see... Born 1840, died 1926... and a French Impressionist painter. That's the key. 1840-1926, French Impressionist painter. That immediately screams a particular individual. 

Alright, let's mentally run through the Impressionists. Who fits the dates? Monet, Manet, Renoir, Degas, Pissarro... Okay, I'll quickly check the birth and death years of the usual suspects. Manet, no. Pissarro, no. Degas, no. Sisley, no. Renoir, close, but no. Morisot, no. Aha! **Monet!** Born in 1840, died in 1926. And, of course, a founding figure of the Impressionist movement, the description is a perfect match. Confirmed.

The historical figure you are referring to is Claude Monet.
