Okay, the user wants the name of a historical figure. Let's see... I've got the key details: born in 1564, died in 1642, an Italian mathematician, physicist, philosopher, and astronomer. Alright, that date range, the nationality, and those fields... It *has* to be Galileo Galilei. Let's confirm: born 1564, died 1642, Italian... Yup. And he was definitely a mathematician, physicist, philosopher, and astronomer. No question. He fits the bill perfectly! Is there anyone else from that period? No, da Vinci is too early, Bruno was earlier... Nope. It's Galileo. I need to deliver a direct answer, and they want the answer on its own line at the end, so I should create an introductory sentence, then the clean answer.

The historical figure who fits that description is Galileo Galilei.

Galileo Galilei
