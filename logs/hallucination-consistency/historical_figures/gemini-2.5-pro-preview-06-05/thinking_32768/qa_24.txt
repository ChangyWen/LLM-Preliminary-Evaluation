Okay, let's see. The user wants to know who was born in 1908, died in 1973, and was the 28th president of Chile. Right, straightforward enough. First, I'll break down the information. The birth year, 1908; death year, 1973; and the key detail – 28th president of Chile. Now, the user also has this "(1908–1973)" notation, and that's where I see a slight red flag. Usually, those parentheses indicate a term of office or a lifespan. Here, it's repeating the lifespan, so it might be a bit unclear, or there's a typo. My initial thought is that the question is asking about the person who was president and who lived from 1908 to 1973.

My next step? I'll formulate a search strategy. I'd start with "28th president of Chile." Then, I can cross-reference with "President of Chile born 1908" and "President of Chile died 1973". Even better, I can search for all three criteria together. Let's see...who was a significant Chilean president who died in 1973? Ah, yes, that would be Salvador Allende. He died during the coup d'état. Excellent.

Now, I'll quickly double-check. Born in 1908? Yep, June 26, 1908. Died in 1973? Absolutely, September 11, 1973. And was he the 28th president? Yep, all the reliable sources confirm it: Wikipedia, history websites, everything. Ah! And his presidency was from 1970 to 1973.

So, putting it all together… the person who matches the user's criteria is Salvador Allende. The parenthetical dates are a bit misleading as it repeats the lifespan, which might not be intended. I’ll mention the correct presidential term dates for clarity. Right.

The historical figure you are referring to is Salvador Allende.
He was born in 1908 and died in 1973.
He served as the 28th president of Chile from 1970 until his death during the coup d'état in 1973.

Salvador Allende
