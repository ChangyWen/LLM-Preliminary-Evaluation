Okay, let me think this through. The user wants the name of someone, a historical figure. Right. Let's break down the clues. They've given me a birth year of 1932 and a death year of 1986. That's a pretty tight timeframe, limiting the possibilities considerably. The key here is the detailed description. "Soviet and Russian filmmaker" – that's the core. Then, "writer, film editor, film theorist, and theatre and opera director." Wow, this person was clearly deeply involved in all aspects of the art.

Okay, where to start? Let's pull from my knowledge base. I immediately think of the giants of Soviet cinema, the big names. Who would fit? Eisenstein is out, died too early. Vertov, too. Tarkovsky? The dates *feel* right, he was important and did a lot of writing. Parajanov is another potential candidate. He was definitely a filmmaker. I will quickly check the key details. Kalatozov, no...died in 1973.

Alright, let me check Tarkovsky specifically. 1932 birth? Yes. Died in 1986? Yes. And then the description. Soviet filmmaker? Absolutely. *Andrei Rublev*, *Solaris*, *Stalker* – iconic films. Writer? Yes, he wrote or co-wrote all his films, plus that brilliant book, *Sculpting in Time*. Film editor? Certainly, he was heavily involved. Film theorist? Indeed, *Sculpting in Time* is seminal. Theatre and opera director? Yes, he did *Hamlet* and *Boris Godunov*.

Parajanov... born in 1924. No, wrong birth year.

Tarkovsky ticks every box. The dates, the profession, the additional details all perfectly match. He's the one.

The historical figure you are describing is Andrei Tarkovsky.
