Okay, let's see. The user wants a name, a specific historical figure. I need to isolate the core query from the request. The user is essentially providing a set of parameters: birth year 1904, death year 1996, and "Czech association football player". Hmm, that's pretty definitive! I'll need to leverage that information, which acts as the unique identifier.

Right, so I'll craft some search queries based on those parameters. First, I'll try the most direct one: "Czech association football player 1904 1996". Then maybe variations, like "famous Czech footballer born 1904" or "famous Czech footballer died 1996" just to be thorough.

Ah, a quick search using the initial query produces a result immediately. It looks like František Plánička. Let's quickly verify. Okay, born June 2, 1904. Died July 20, 1996. Czech nationality. Association football player – even a goalkeeper! The details match perfectly. He's also a significant figure, captain of Czechoslovakia's 1934 World Cup runners-up team. That solidifies it; this has to be the guy.

The user's goal is to get the *name*. I'm confident in the answer, and the formatting specifies that the final answer must be on a new line.

The historical figure you are referring to is František Plánička.

František Plánička
