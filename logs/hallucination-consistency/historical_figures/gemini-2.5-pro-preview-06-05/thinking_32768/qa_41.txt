Right, the user wants the name of a historical figure, a Chilean politician and President born in 1896 and who died in 1986. Okay, let's get to it. First, let's break down the key information. The birth and death years are the key here - 1896 to 1986. That's a pretty tight timeframe, perfect for pinpointing the individual. I could search by the full dates or look for major Chilean presidents of that period. Let's see, Allende... wrong dates. Pinochet, also wrong dates. Frei Montalva... no. Wait, Jorge Alessandri Rodríguez! Born 1896, died 1986, Chilean politician and President. Nailed it. He was president from 1958 to 1964, fits the description perfectly. The description is a direct quote, making it even easier. Okay, the answer is Jorge Alessandri Rodríguez. I will state the name.

The historical figure described is Jorge Alessandri Rodríguez.
