Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a name, a historical figure's name, specifically. Right, so first, I need to pull out the key identifying characteristics they've provided. Born in 1921, died in 1989, and known for being a "Soviet nuclear physicist and human rights activist."

Now, let's break that down. "Soviet nuclear physicist" is the core. That screams a very specific field, almost certainly pointing to someone involved in the Soviet atomic or hydrogen bomb programs. I'm thinking Kurchatov, Khariton, maybe Sakharov... But the "human rights activist" piece is *critical*. Kurchatov and Khariton, brilliant as they were, weren't known for dissent. They were integral to the Soviet system. So, that narrows it down *considerably*.

And the dates, 1921-1989. Okay, that's a check. This is starting to look like Andrei Sakharov. That would fit. The work on the hydrogen bomb, and then the later activism, his Nobel Peace Prize...

Let me just quickly verify. Birth year? 1921, yes, that's right. Death year, 1989? Yes, that also fits. A Soviet nuclear physicist? Absolutely. Human rights activist? Undeniably. He's a perfect match.

So, the answer is clear, this is my conclusion, and I am confident. It is the final answer requested by the user.

Andrei Sakharov
