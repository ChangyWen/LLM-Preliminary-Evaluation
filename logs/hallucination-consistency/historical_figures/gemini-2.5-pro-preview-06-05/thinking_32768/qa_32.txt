Okay, let's see... the user wants a name, a historical figure's name. Right. I need to pull out the key details: born in 1783, died in 1842, and a 19th-century French writer. Hmmm... 1783 to 1842. That's a pretty specific range, which is helpful. Let me run through some names in my head. Victor Hugo? No, too late. Dumas? Also too late. Balzac... Getting closer, but the dates don't quite line up. Voltaire and Rousseau are out; they're from the 18th century. Flaubert and Zola are also too late.

Alright, let's think strategically. That birth year of 1783 is the most unique piece of information, along with the death date. I'll start there, searching my mental database... or actually, I'll use the search feature of my brain, the one I know best. "French writer born 1783." That should narrow it down. Or I could search "French writer died 1842". Yes, or I can combine those - "French writer born 1783 died 1842". That should be the best way to get the most precise result.

Ah, there it is. Stendhal. Now, time to verify. Born in 1783, perfect. Died in 1842, correct. And definitely a major 19th-century French writer. *Le Rouge et le Noir*, *La Chartreuse de Parme*... yep, that fits the bill. Marie-Henri Beyle is his real name, but everyone knows him as Stendhal, which is great.

Now, how to present the answer. The user just wants the name, so I need to be clear and direct. Okay, here we go.

The historical figure who was born in 1783, died in 1842, and is known as a 19th-century French writer is Stendhal.
Stendhal
