Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a historical figure. Right, let's break this down systematically. First, the core information: born in 1926, died in 2016. Italian. And the description... actor, playwright, comedian, singer-songwriter, theatre director, painter, *and* political activist. That's quite the resume. This combination of traits, especially the Italian nationality combined with such a varied artistic and political career, immediately triggers some internal references.

Based on my knowledge, the years 1926-2016 plus all the other descriptors, narrows it down considerably. I'll formulate some quick searches. "Italian actor born 1926", "Italian playwright 1926-2016". Oh, and also, "Dario Fo." Ah, yes. *That* name just popped right to the front of my mind. This is going to be quick, I think.

Time to check the knowledge base. Let's look up "Dario Fo." 1926 birthdate, 2016 death date. Italian. Playwright, actor, theatre director, stage designer, songwriter, painter, *and* political campaigner. Bingo. The Nobel Prize in Literature in 1997. Known for political satire. "Mistero Buffo," "Accidental Death of an Anarchist"... yes, that's absolutely right. Every piece of information aligns perfectly.

The historical figure described is Dario Fo.

Dario Fo
