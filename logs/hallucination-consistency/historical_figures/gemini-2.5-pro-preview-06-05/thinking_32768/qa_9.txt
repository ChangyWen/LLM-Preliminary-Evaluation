Okay, let's see. The user wants the name of a historical figure. Right, let's see... Born in 1599, died in 1660, a Spanish painter. Hmm...that points directly to Velázquez. I know my history. Let's double-check the details quickly. Yep, Diego Velázquez... born in 1599, baptized in Seville, died in Madrid in 1660. Spanish, Baroque period... court painter to King Philip IV. Definitely him. So, the answer is clear, and the formatting is crucial. The user specifically wants the final answer on a new line. I'll construct a helpful sentence, and then, on the new line, just the name.

The historical figure you are describing is Diego Velázquez.
Diego Velázquez
