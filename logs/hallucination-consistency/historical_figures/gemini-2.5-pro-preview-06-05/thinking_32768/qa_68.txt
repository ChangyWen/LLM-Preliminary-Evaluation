Okay, the user's query is for the name of a historical figure, specifically a Chilean politician and president who was born in 1858 and died in 1930. My brain immediately processes the core data points: birth year, death year, and the job title. My expertise kicks in, and I start sifting through my knowledge of Chilean history. I need to identify who fits this biographical outline. I can immediately rule out certain possibilities like Alessandri, Ibáñez and Figueroa.

I'll do a knowledge base search, which will pinpoint the individual in question. I'm familiar with the political figures of the era. My internal knowledge bank is excellent on this subject, and a quick query retrieves the details. It points directly to Juan Luis Sanfuentes Andonaegui. I confirm his birthdate, his death date, and that he served as President of Chile. The description provided confirms this. Perfect match!

The format is simple. The user is asking "What is the name...". The key is to present the name, in the correct format as asked.

The answer is:

That historical figure is Juan Luis Sanfuentes Andonaegui.

Juan Luis Sanfuentes Andonaegui
