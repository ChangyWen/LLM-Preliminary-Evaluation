Okay, the user needs the name of a historical figure. I've got the key details: born in 1877, died in 1960, a Chilean army officer and political figure. Time to do a quick search, either mental or actual. I'll probably type in something like "Chilean politician 1877-1960." That'll likely bring up Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. Now, double-check: Born 1877? Check. Died 1960? Check. Army officer and political figure? Bingo. Right, and he was President of Chile, twice.

So, the best way to phrase this is: The historical figure you're referring to is:

Carlos Ibáñez del Campo
