Okay, let's see. The user wants a historical figure. Alright, I see the constraints: born in 1775, died in 1836, and a French physicist and mathematician. Hmm, a classic. Time to search my internal knowledge base.

First, I'll break down the request. Keywords: "French physicist and mathematician", "born 1775", "died 1836". I'll formulate my search strategy using those elements. I'll look for someone who fits all three criteria.

I'll start with a basic search: "French physicist and mathematician born 1775". Then, "French physicist and mathematician died 1836". Then I'll try combining those: "French physicist and mathematician 1775-1836".

Ah, yes, the name that pops into mind is André-Marie Ampère. Now, let's verify those details. Born January 20, 1775? Check. Died June 10, 1836? Check. French? Check. Physicist and mathematician? Check. He's a founder of electromagnetism. He's the guy.

So, the answer is definitively André-Marie Ampère. Now, to format this for the user. They want the answer on a new line, so the response should have some context, then the answer on a new line.

I'll go with this: "The historical figure you are referring to is André-Marie Ampère.

André-Marie Ampère"
