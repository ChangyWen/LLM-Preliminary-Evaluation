Okay, the user needs the name of a historical figure, so I need to use the provided information to identify them. Let's see... 1915-2006, Chilean general and politician. Hmm, those dates are very specific. The description immediately narrows it down; there was only one major figure who fits that profile in that timeframe. I'll quickly cross-reference with what I know: who was a prominent Chilean general and politician who died around that time? Augusto Pinochet immediately comes to mind. Now, let me verify... Born in 1915, died in 2006? Yep, checks out. General and politician of Chile? Absolutely. That's him. No doubt about it. Okay, time to format the response as requested.

The historical figure who was born in 1915, died in 2006, and is known as a general and politician of Chile is Augusto Pinochet.
