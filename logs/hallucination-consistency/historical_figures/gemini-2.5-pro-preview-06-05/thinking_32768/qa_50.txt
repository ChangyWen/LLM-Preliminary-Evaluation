Okay, let's see. The user wants a name. First, I need to pinpoint the key features of this person. Born in 1622, died in 1673, and known as a French playwright and actor. Right, so the 17th century in France. That helps narrow things down significantly, the era of Louis XIV and the rise of French theatre.

Let's brainstorm. Corneille, a big name... but no, his dates don't fit. Racine, another giant... nope, dates are wrong. Then there's *the* name... Molière. Wait a second, 1622-1673? That's a *perfect* match. Born Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, isn't it? And he's the *definitive* French playwright and actor! Comedy, especially – *Tartuffe*, *The Misanthrope*, all those classics.

Right. I'm confident. Born 1622, died 1673, French playwright and actor... It *has* to be Molière. So, I'll give the name and then provide a little contextual information. Makes it a better answer, shows my understanding. I'll make sure the final answer is on a new line, as instructed.

The historical figure you are describing is the famous French playwright and actor Molière, whose real name was Jean-Baptiste Poquelin. He is considered one of the greatest masters of comedy in Western literature.
