Okay, the user wants to know the name of a historical figure, given some specific details. Let's see, the birth year is 1541 and the death year is 1614. Okay, that firmly places them in the late Renaissance/Mannerist period. Hmm, and the person was a painter, sculptor, and architect, a classic Renaissance man, essentially. Now the kicker - "Greek." That's the key here. A Greek artist of that period, known for all three arts... the name that leaps to mind is El Greco.

Let me just double-check: El Greco... yes, his real name was Doménikos Theotokópoulos. Birth year, 1541, matches. Death year, 1614... perfect match. And his origin? Born in Crete, which at the time was part of Venice, but he was ethnically Greek - nailed it! Primarily known as a painter, but he was a sculptor and architect as well... particularly known for his altarpieces. So yes, "painter, sculptor, architect" fits perfectly.

Right, the answer is clearly El Greco. Let's keep it concise and clear:

The historical figure you are referring to is Doménikos Theotokópoulos, who is universally known by his nickname, El Greco (which means "The Greek"). He was a prominent painter, sculptor, and architect of the Spanish Renaissance who was born in Crete in 1541 and died in Toledo, Spain, in 1614.
