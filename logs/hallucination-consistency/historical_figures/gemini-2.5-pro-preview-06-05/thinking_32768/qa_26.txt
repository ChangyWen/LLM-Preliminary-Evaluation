Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know the name of a historical figure who was born in 1921, died in 1981, and was a French singer-songwriter and poet. This is a straightforward question, and I can handle this easily.

First, I need to identify the key elements: the birth year, the death year, and the profession/nationality. Okay, I've got it. Next, I'll devise a search strategy. I'll use those keywords: "French singer-songwriter poet born 1921 died 1981". I'll tap into my internal knowledge base – it's time to bring up some names. Let's see, who are the famous French singer-songwriters? Edith Piaf, Aznavour, Gainsbourg, Brel, Brassens... Right, let's quickly run through their dates. Piaf doesn't fit. Aznavour doesn't fit. Gainsbourg is out. Brel was Belgian, so no. Wait… what about Brassens? Let me check. Born October 22, 1921? Bingo! Died October 29, 1981? Perfect! French singer-songwriter and poet? Absolutely.

Georges Brassens fits perfectly. I know he was a major figure in French chanson, famous for his clever lyrics and guitar style. Now, let's put together the answer. I should give a clear answer, and then I can add a sentence to provide context. And, most importantly, follow the user's formatting request, which means the answer needs to be on a new line at the end. Alright, let's say something like: "The historical figure you are referring to is Georges Brassens. He was a highly influential French singer-songwriter and poet, known for his eloquent lyrics and distinctive style." Then, on a new line…
