Okay, let's see. The user wants a name, a historical figure. Right, so I need to pull out the critical information. Hmm... born in 1756, died in 1791, and an Austrian composer from the Classical period. Easy enough. First, the dates. 1756 to 1791. That's a very specific timeframe, a pretty short life actually. Now, what makes them famous? Austrian composer of the Classical period. This is the key, really. Classical period... Austria... That narrows things down considerably. Who were the big Austrian names in music back then? Mozart, Haydn, maybe a bit of Schubert, but he's closer to the Romantic era, and then Gluck, who's a bit earlier. Let's start eliminating. Haydn? No, his dates are off. Schubert? Wrong dates. Gluck... Nope. Okay, Mozart. Let's see... Born in 1756? Yep. Died in 1791? Bingo! Austrian composer of the Classical period? Absolutely! He's arguably *the* Austrian composer of that period. All the clues align perfectly. Seems obvious now. Therefore, I'll format it nicely.

The historical figure who was born in 1756, died in 1791, and is known as an Austrian composer of the Classical period is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
