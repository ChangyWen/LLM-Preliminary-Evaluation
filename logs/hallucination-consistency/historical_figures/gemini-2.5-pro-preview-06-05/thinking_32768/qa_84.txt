Okay, the user wants a name. Let's see... the clue is "first Emperor of Brazil." Hmm, and there are dates – born in 1798, died in 1834. Right, I need to identify that person. "First Emperor of Brazil" – that's the key. I immediately think of Pedro I, but let's verify. Born in 1798? Yes, that's right. Died in 1834? Yes, confirmed. He was also King Pedro IV of Portugal, but since the prompt specifies "Emperor of Brazil," I'll go with the most direct answer. His full name is incredibly long, but the user just wants the name. So, let's state it plainly.

Pedro I of Brazil
