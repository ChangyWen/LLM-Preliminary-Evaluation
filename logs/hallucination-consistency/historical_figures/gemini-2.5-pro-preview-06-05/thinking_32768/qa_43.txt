Okay, let's see. The user wants a historical figure. Right, I need to identify the person based on the clues. First, let me pull out the key details: born in 1524, died in 1580, and known as a Portuguese poet. Now, that's a pretty specific request, so I'll formulate a search query, either in my memory banks or perhaps through a quick external search if I need to jog my memory, something like "Portuguese poet born 1524 died 1580."

Ah, my internal knowledge base immediately brings up Luís Vaz de Camões, the greatest Portuguese poet. Let me just quickly verify the dates. Yes, born around 1524, and died in 1580. Perfect match! His primary claim to fame is his poetry, especially his epic poem, *Os Lusíadas*. The information aligns perfectly.

So, to summarize, the historical figure is Luís Vaz de Camões. I'll present the answer as the user requested, starting with a confirming sentence and then putting the name on a new line.

The historical figure you are describing is Luís Vaz de Camões.
