Okay, the user needs the name of a historical figure, easy enough. Let's seeâ€¦ Born in 1802, died in 1885, a French poet, novelist, and dramatist. Those dates are pretty specific. I'll start by keying in a quick search in my mental database: "French writer born 1802 died 1885". Right, I'm almost certain it's Victor Hugo, but I should double-check.

Let's confirm. Born in 1802, died in 1885, French, and known for poetry, novels, and plays. Definitely Hugo. And that's a good cross-reference, given his prominence. Okay, that's done. Now, according to the instructions, I need to give a direct answer, and the actual name goes on a separate line.

The historical figure matching those specifics is Victor Hugo.
