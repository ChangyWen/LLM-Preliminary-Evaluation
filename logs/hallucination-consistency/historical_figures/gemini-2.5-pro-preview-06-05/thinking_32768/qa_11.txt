Okay, let's see... the user wants a historical figure, an American singer and actor. The years are the key here - born in 1935, died in 1977. Hmm, 1977... that's a significant year, and 1935 narrows the possibilities considerably. The profession is a singer and actor, so we can immediately rule out a lot of figures. The obvious choice, given those dates and that description, is Elvis Presley. I need to double-check the details, but I'm fairly certain. Elvis fits the bill perfectly. Actor, singer, born in '35, died in '77. Right. Okay, I need to structure this properly. Start with a clear identification based on the description, then provide the final answer on a new line as instructed. Simple enough. Alright, here's the answer:

The historical figure who was born in 1935, died in 1977, and is known as an American singer and actor is Elvis Presley.
