Okay, the user wants the name of a historical figure, and they've given me some details. Let's see... I need to identify the person based on the clues. The birth and death years are 1473-1543, which immediately tells me it's someone from the Renaissance period. They were a mathematician, astronomer, and clergyman. That's a pretty interesting mix of professions, but not unheard of back then. The real clincher, though, is the major achievement: formulating the heliocentric model of the Universe. Hmm... who proposed that during the Renaissance?

Synthesizing the information, the heliocentric model is the key. Copernicus, right? Let me just quickly double-check. Born 1473? Yep. Died 1543? Correct. Mathematician and astronomer? Absolutely. His work is fundamental. Clergyman? Yes, he held a position in the Church. Everything lines up perfectly.

The historical figure you are describing is Nicolaus Copernicus.

Nicolaus Copernicus
