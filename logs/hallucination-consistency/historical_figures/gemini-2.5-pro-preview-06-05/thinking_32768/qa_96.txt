*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'm thinking about this. The user wants a name. I need to recall a historical figure based on the provided criteria: birth year 1785, death year 1873, and known as an "Italian poet and novelist." That's quite specific, which helps. My knowledge base instantly points to Alessandro Manzoni. I know his dates align, and he's a major figure in Italian literature. His novel, *I Promessi Sposi*, is a landmark work.

So, now, I have to formulate the response. The prompt explicitly asks for the name and specifies that it should be presented on a new line at the end. This is the key part: I want to give a helpful answer and follow the instructions perfectly. The user wants the name, but they've included a formatting request. I have to take that into account.

I've tried various phrasings. The user wants the *name*, so let's keep it direct. I could just say "Alessandro Manzoni," on a new line. But that might be *too* direct. I need to lead into it. I've decided that a sentence that doesn't include the name, followed by the name itself on a new line is the best approach.

The final plan is: "The historical figure with those dates and description is:" followed by a new line and then "Alessandro Manzoni". This fulfills the prompt's intent (to be informative) and its precise requirements (final answer on a new line).
