Okay, the user's looking for a historical figure based on some clues. Let's see... First, they want a name. Good. I need to pull out the important details. 1892-1973, a British philologist, and author of classic high fantasy. Right away, that screams J.R.R. Tolkien. But, I have to be thorough, so let's break it down.

Those dates lock the person in. Philology points to a British academic, likely associated with Oxford or Cambridge. Then, classic high fantasy. Tolkien is practically the definition of that! Let's quickly run through the other possibilities. C.S. Lewis? Nope, wrong dates. Ursula K. Le Guin? American, wrong dates. George MacDonald and William Morris? Wrong dates. Tolkien it is. Let's double-check those dates. Yep, born 1892, died 1973. British philologist? Absolutely, Professor at Oxford. Classic high fantasy author? *The Hobbit*, *The Lord of the Rings*... absolutely. Perfect match!

Now, I need to formulate the answer. The user wants the final answer on a new line at the end. Okay. So, a preamble, then a new line, then the name. Let's go with a simple, clear statement.

The historical figure who was born in 1892, died in 1973, and is known as a 'British philologist and author of classic high fantasy works' is John Ronald Reuel Tolkien.

J.R.R. Tolkien
