Okay, the user needs the name of a historical figure. Right, let's break this down. Born in 1937, died in 2012, and a Dutch writer and translator. Straightforward enough, I think.

First, I'll get a search strategy going. I can try a few queries: "Dutch writer born 1937 died 2012", "Dutch translator born 1937 died 2012". I could also try something broader and then filter: "Famous Dutch people born 1937" and then sift through those results. Let's see what pops up.

Alright, running the first search, "Dutch writer born 1937 died 2012"... top result is Gerrit Komrij. Okay, let me verify that. Born in...1944? Nope. Wrong year. Time for a different angle. Maybe the birth year is off, or maybe the user is more concerned about the description. So, let me look for Dutch writers who died in 2012.

"Dutch writer died 2012"... Ah, Gerrit Komrij again, but he's out. Then there's Bernlef. Let me seeâ€¦Born in 1937, died in 2012. And a writer, poet, and translator. Bingo. That looks like a perfect fit.

I'll confirm the details for Bernlef, just to be sure. Hendrik Jan Marsman, is his full name. Born January 14, 1937, Died October 29, 2012. Writer, poet, and translator. Yes, perfect. He's definitely a significant figure, particularly remembered for *Hersenschimmen* (*Out of Mind*).

So, the user's asking for the name of this person. The criteria are met: born 1937, died 2012, and a Dutch writer and translator. The answer is J. Bernlef. Now, the formatting... just the name, on a new line.

Let me just double-check. Yes, J. Bernlef. All the criteria are met. Formatting is correct. Good.

J. Bernlef
