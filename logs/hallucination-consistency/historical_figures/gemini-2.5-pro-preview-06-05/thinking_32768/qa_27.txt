Alright, the user's asked for the name of a historical figure matching specific criteria: born 1821, died 1896, and a German mathematician. I need to figure out who fits those constraints. Okay, first things first, I need to understand the request. They're asking for a name. Then I have to extract the key details: birth year, death year, and area of expertise. A strategy starts to form in my mind; I'll need to cross-reference my knowledge of German mathematicians with those dates.

Where to begin? Let's start with a mental inventory. Gauss? Nope, dates don't align. Riemann? Nope. Hilbert? No. Okay, maybe a different approach is needed. I'll search my internal databases for mathematicians born in 1821, then cross-reference the death dates. Hmm, nothing jumping out immediately. Then I thought, what about a slightly less well-known German mathematician? Let me refine my search. Wait a minute, Weierstrass... dates are close...1815-1897... Nope, not quite. Hmm, I’ll try Helmholtz. He was born 1821 and died in 1894. Close but not quite. Arthur Cayley? No. Pafnuty Chebyshev? Russian. Right. Back to the drawing board. I'll try searching for "German mathematician born 1821 died 1896" now. 

That's pretty specific. Hmm. Ok, nothing there. I'll try a general search for famous people born in 1821, and then famous people who died in 1896, and then see if I can find any overlap. Hmm...no German mathematicians appear. Alright. Maybe the dates are *very* specific, and it's a somewhat obscure figure.

Let me broaden my search. "German mathematician 1821-1896"... that turns up a potential candidate: Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass. Let me double-check his dates... October 31, 1815 – February 19, 1897. Close, but no cigar. Let me run through my internal database again. Let me consider Hermann von Helmholtz again... Died in 1894... Hmm, what about those who died in 1896? There are a few, but not German mathematicians. This is tough! Let me go back to the original prompt... and the constraints... "German mathematician"... Is it possible that the "German mathematician" part is a little off, and it's someone whose work was related to math, but not explicitly known for that? Hmmm...

I'm getting a strong feeling that there is indeed an answer, even if a tricky one. Okay, a targeted search then, in the context of biographical information. *(birth_year:1821) AND (death_year:1896) AND (occupation:mathematician) AND (nationality:German)*. Let's see... Ah! Ernst Engel! Now, he was a statistician and economist. The dates are *perfect*. He was German. Okay, is that close enough to *German mathematician*? Statistics *is* a branch of mathematics, or at least, uses it heavily. This is interesting.

Let me check the other options I already ran across. Weierstrass? Close dates, but not right. Helmholtz...wrong death year. The others are the wrong nationalities, or didn't have a death year of 1896. Engel fits the date criteria exactly.

I think I have it. Ernst Engel. He was a German statistician. While not a "German mathematician" *per se*, his work was heavily mathematical. All other possibilities are not good enough, since they don't fit *all* of the criteria perfectly. Okay, final answer. Let's get this right. Re-reading the instructions. Okay, "What is the name... Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." Fine. Let's make it so.

The historical figure with those birth and death years is the German statistician Ernst Engel.
