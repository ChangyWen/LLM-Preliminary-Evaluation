*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the name of a historical figure, a fairly straightforward request. The constraints are: born in 1844, died in 1896, and a French poet. Right, I'll approach this systematically.

First, I'll formulate a search strategy. I could search for "French poet born 1844," or "French poet died 1896," or maybe combine them with "French poet 1844-1896". It seems the most direct route is a combination.

Next, I'll execute the search. Hmm, I'm pretty confident. "French poet born 1844" - Ah, that practically screams Paul Verlaine. Now, let's double-check those dates and profession. "Paul Verlaine death date" - yep, 1896. "Paul Verlaine profession" - famous French poet, key figure in Symbolism and Decadence; spot on.

Okay, synthesizing the information. Verlaine's the guy. Born in 1844, died in 1896, French poet, check, check, check. Easy.

Now to construct the answer, and to make sure I follow the instructions. The user wants the name, and the answer on a new line. "The historical figure you are describing is Paul Verlaine." That works. Now, the final answer on its own line.

I think that's everything. Good to go.
Paul Verlaine
