Okay, let's see. The user wants a specific name, a historical figure. I need to zero in on the constraints. Born in 1899, died in 1943... right in the thick of things, WWII. And the key is "French resistance fighter and civil servant." That's a highly specific combo. Civil servant suggests a pre-war career, then active in the resistance.

Alright, let's break this down internally. I'll immediately go to my internal library. Where do I start? Probably a search focused on the dates, adding the resistance fighter bit. Let's try "French resistance fighter born 1899," and then "French resistance fighter died 1943." Then, refine it, "French civil servant resistance fighter." And then, of course, the trifecta: "French resistance fighter civil servant born 1899 died 1943."

Wait, Jean Moulin. He immediately comes to mind. Okay, let's quickly verify. 1899 birth? Yes, I think it was in Béziers? Yep, June 20, 1899. Died in 1943? Absolutely, July 8th, 1943. And the roles? Civil servant... yes, he was a *préfet*, a high-ranking official. He was the youngest prefect, I believe. A prefect is a civil servant, no question. Resistance fighter? Oh, absolutely. He's the poster child! Sent by de Gaulle to unify the French Resistance. His death in 1943... captured, tortured by the Gestapo (Klaus Barbie, wasn't it?), and died en route to Germany. Yep, it all fits.

It’s undoubtedly Jean Moulin. There's no other figure that lines up with such precision. The user wants the name on a new line, so I will ensure that's followed. The answer is Jean Moulin.
