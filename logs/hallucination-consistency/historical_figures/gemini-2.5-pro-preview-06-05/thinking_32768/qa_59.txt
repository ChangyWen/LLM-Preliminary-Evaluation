Okay, the user's asking for a historical figure's name based on a birth year, death year, and profession: a Chilean politician born in 1898 and who died in 1980. My immediate thought is to formulate a search query using those key details. A simple search like "Chilean politician 1898-1980" would be a good start. The fact that the user also provided "known for: 'Chilean politician (1898-1980)'" is interesting; it feels like a specific database entry or a trivia question. This suggests a very precise identifier.

I'd start with the direct search, but if that doesn't work, I'll try breaking it down: searching for Chilean politicians born in 1898 and then Chilean politicians who died in 1980, hoping to find a match. If that's too broad, I'll refine the search using the exact phrase "Chilean politician (1898-1980)" with quotes. If that's also unsuccessful, I would consider whether the birth/death years are slightly off. Based on the prompt's structure, I suspect it's a unique identifier.

I'll then need to verify the details of any potential matches against the user's provided criteria. Checking multiple sources, like Wikipedia or other historical databases, is critical to ensure accuracy.

After a few tries, I need to recognize that the description itself is the primary clue. A more in-depth search, perhaps even a Wikidata search, could reveal the correct individual.

So, the answer appears to be Gabriel González Videla. Now, how should I format the response? The user's request explicitly mentions placing the final answer on a new line. So, I'll frame the response accordingly. My first thought is to provide a sentence that confirms the finding and then, on a new line, the answer as requested. The name is the final answer. So, I'll lead with an introductory sentence and then provide the final answer on a separate line.
