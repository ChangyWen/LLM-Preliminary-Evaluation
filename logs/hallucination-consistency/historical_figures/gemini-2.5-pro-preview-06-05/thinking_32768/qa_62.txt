Okay, the user wants a name, a historical figure. Right. Let's break this down. First, I need to know *who* they're asking about. They've given me some clues: birth in 1360, death in 1428, and that they were a medieval Russian artist. Alright, that's a pretty specific timeframe and region.

Let's analyze: Late 14th to early 15th century... that's squarely in the medieval period. And the focus is on *Russian* art. Hmm.  That means I'm thinking icon painting, frescoes... the usual suspects in Muscovy. Who was the big name?

I'll run through some quick mental checks. Theophanes the Greek was a big influence, but he wasn't *Russian* born, was he? And his dates don't quite line up perfectly. Then there's Dionisius, but he's a little later in the game.

Wait a minute... That time frame and profession... It's practically *screaming* Andrei Rublev.

Now, I need to verify. Let's see: born *circa* 1360... yep, fits the bill. And died around 1428... perfect. And is he known for being a "medieval Russian artist"? Absolutely. Considered one of the greatest Orthodox icon painters, no question. The Trinity... iconic work.

So, yeah, it's definitely Andrei Rublev. Easy peasy. Now, how to present this to the user? They just want the name, right? Okay, I'll just keep it clean and direct. Give them a quick identifying sentence, then the name on a new line, as the prompt is implying I should do. Done.

The answer is:
Andrei Rublev
