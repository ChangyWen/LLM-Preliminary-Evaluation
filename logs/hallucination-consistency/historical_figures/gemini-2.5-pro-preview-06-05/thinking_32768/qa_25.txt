Okay, let's see. The user needs the name of a historical figure. Right, got it.

Alright, let's break down the constraints. 1713 to 1784... definitely the 18th century, the Enlightenment. "French Enlightenment philosopher and encyclopædist"... hmm, "encyclopædist" is the key. That's the big clue, pointing to the *Encyclopédie*... who ran that thing? Ah, yes, Diderot. Now, let's double-check those dates... Born in 1713, died in 1784? Yes, that's right, October 5, 1713, to be exact. And Diderot *was* the chief editor and driving force behind the *Encyclopédie*, a major French Enlightenment figure. Voltaire? No, wrong dates. Rousseau? Nope. Montesquieu? Forget about it. D'Alembert? Close, but the dates don't quite line up. Diderot is the only one who checks all the boxes.

Perfect, this is an easy one.

Here's your answer:

Denis Diderot
