Okay, the user needs the name of a historical figure, based on some clues. Let's see, I see the birth year, death year, and a description of the individual's fame. Right away, "first person to reach the South Pole" is the key. That's almost a dead giveaway. I immediately think of Roald Amundsen. Now, let's confirm with the other clues. He was a Norwegian explorer, that fits. Born in 1872, died in 1928... let me quickly double-check the dates in my memory. Yes, those dates are correct for Amundsen. So, the answer is Roald Amundsen. The user wants it formatted on a new line at the end, so I will craft a short introduction and then the answer on the final line, as requested.

Roald Amundsen
