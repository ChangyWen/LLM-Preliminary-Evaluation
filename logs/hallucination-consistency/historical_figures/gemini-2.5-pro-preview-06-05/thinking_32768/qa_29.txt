Okay, let me think about this. The user wants the name of a historical figure. I need to zero in on the key information provided.

First, I'll grab the clues: 1854 to 1891, a French poet, and someone who influenced modern literature and arts, also prefiguring Surrealism. Alright, the dates are a strong starting point, that narrows things down considerably. A short life, that's good. Now, let's break down those clues: 19th-century French poet. So, French, poet. Makes sense. And influencing modernism and prefiguring surrealism... those are the big hints. It really points to a specific kind of figure, a *major* figure.

Okay, let's see. Famous French poets of the 19th century... Victor Hugo? Hmm, no, his dates are off. Baudelaire? No, same problem. Verlaine? Close, but not quite. Mallarm√©? Still not quite right. Wait... Rimbaud. Arthur Rimbaud. Now, let's double-check. Born 1854, died 1891? Bingo. The exact dates! French poet? Check. Influence? Symbolism is a key. His work, *A Season in Hell*, *Illuminations*... hallucinatory, visionary, that's exactly what I would expect. Those qualities absolutely influenced modernism and were picked up by the Surrealists later on.

He fits *all* the criteria. A short, intense life, the right dates, a French poet with the right *kind* of influence. It's Rimbaud.

Okay, I'll formulate my answer. First, I'll give the user the name directly. Then I'll confirm the matches, just to show I've thought this through and verified it. I'll highlight the dates, and the influence on modernism and Surrealism, as per the clues provided.

I'll start with: "The historical figure you are describing is Arthur Rimbaud. He was a French poet born in 1854 and died in 1891. His work, characterized by its visionary and surreal qualities, had a profound impact on modern literature and the arts, and is considered a major forerunner to Surrealism."

And per instructions...

Arthur Rimbaud
