Okay, the user's asking for a historical figure, a specific name. Let's see what we've got. They gave me a birth year of 1707 and a death year of 1778. And a description: "Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist." Alright, "Swedish botanist"... that's a huge clue. That, plus the timeframe, *strongly* suggests a specific person. Let me pull up that mental rolodex of 18th-century naturalists.

Hmm, who fits? Swedish, botanist, physician, zoologistâ€¦and those dates. The most obvious candidate pops into my head immediately. Wait, is it who I think it is? The "father of modern taxonomy"? Let's check the specifics. The dates are key. Born in '07, died in '78? Yeah, those dates are spot on. Okay, and he was a botanist, *definitely*. And a physician, and zoologist? Yes, his system of classification encompassed everything. That's it. 

Okay, so the user wants a name, simple as that. I'll give it to them in a clear and concise manner, with just a little extra value.

The historical figure you are describing is Carl Linnaeus. He is famous for formalizing binomial nomenclature, the modern system of naming organisms.
