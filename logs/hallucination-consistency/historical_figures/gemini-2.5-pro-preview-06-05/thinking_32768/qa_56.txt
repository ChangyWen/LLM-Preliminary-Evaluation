Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The question is: "Who are we talking about?" Alright, let's break it down. The key details are a birth year of 1452, a death year of 1519, and the description "Italian Renaissance polymath."  That's very specific!

First, those dates are a strong constraint. Then the "Italian Renaissance polymath" part really nails it down. Polymath means someone who was skilled in many different fields. The Italian Renaissance was a specific period, so the description helps narrow it down a lot.

Who fits that bill, and lived during that time? I need to access my mental Rolodex of Renaissance figures, focusing on the polymaths. I'm thinking: Michelangelo, Raphael, Donatello...and, yes, *Leonardo da Vinci*. Let's see if the dates match. Michelangelo's birth and death don't line up. Raphael, either. And Donatello, no. Ah, but Leonardo? 1452 to 1519? Perfect.

And the description? A polymath from the Italian Renaissance? Absolutely. Painter, sculptor, architect, musician, scientist, inventor, anatomist... the man was a one-person think tank! The Mona Lisa, The Last Supper...that's him. He's *the* archetype of the Renaissance polymath.

So, there's no doubt. The answer is clear. Here is the answer, presented on a new line as requested:

Leonardo da Vinci
