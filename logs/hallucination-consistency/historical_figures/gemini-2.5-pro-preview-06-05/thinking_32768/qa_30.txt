*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's see. The user needs a name. Right. First, I'll extract the crucial details: born in 1700, died in 1755, and described as a German-born French soldier and statesman. Hmm, that's a specific enough profile.

My initial thought is, of course, Maurice de Saxe. He’s the quintessential German-born French military figure of that era. So, I'll formulate a quick search query: "German-born French soldier statesman 1700-1755," or maybe "historical figure born 1700 died 1755 German French." Let's run that search in my mind, pulling up all that I know about the period.

Ah, yes. Maurice de Saxe, or Maurice, Count of Saxony. The initial search confirms it, or at least, it seems that way. Wait a minute... checking the details. Born 1696? Goslar, Germany. Oh, and he died in 1750! Okay, that's a problem. The birth year is off, and so is the death. Damn, I've missed something. The prompt must be wrong, right?

I'll rethink the approach. The user's given a date and description, so let’s work from there. "French statesman died 1755"? Nope, that leads to Montesquieu, and he doesn't fit the soldier profile. What about, "German-born French soldier died 1755?" Yes, there's another option.

Ulrich Friedrich Woldemar, Graf von Löwendal, or Count Lowendal. That sounds promising. His birth date? April 1, 1700...perfect. And he died in May 1755... bingo! He was, of course, a Marshal of France. This is spot-on. German-born, soldier, and a statesman in the sense of a high-ranking officer.

Now, comparing: de Saxe just doesn't fit the dates. Löwendal absolutely does. He's the only correct answer here.

Ulrich Friedrich Woldemar, Graf von Löwendal, it is. The French version, Ulrich Frédéric Woldemar, Comte de Lowendal, or the English form Ulrich Frederick Woldemar, Count of Löwendal, will also do. However, Count of Löwendal should be good enough. Let's put it on a new line, as requested.

Right. A final check: 1700? Check. 1755? Check. German-born French soldier and statesman? Check.

Ulrich Friedrich Woldemar, Graf von Löwendal
