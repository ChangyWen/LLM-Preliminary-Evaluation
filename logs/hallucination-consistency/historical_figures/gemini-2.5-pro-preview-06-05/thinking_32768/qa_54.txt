Okay, let's see. The user needs a historical figure, a *specific* one. First, I have to understand the constraints: birth in 1606, death in 1684, and "French tragedian." Alright, that's the challenge.

The core of this is the "French tragedian" part. It's the key to unlocking the name, but the dates are strict parameters. I'll formulate a plan to search for this person. I'll start with the most obvious approach and work outward, if I have to. I'll need to mentally review the major players in 17th-century French tragedy – Corneille, Racine, and Molière, for a start. Racine and Molière are the second line, but I know Corneille is the more likely candidate of the three. I know his dates...let me just check.

First step - quickly cross-reference those potential candidates. I'm thinking about Corneille first - born in 1606 is what I'm looking for. Wait, I *think* Corneille fits all the parameters… Right, let's confirm. I know Corneille was a tragedian. Right. Okay, born in 1606... Yes! And died in 1684. Nailed it. He's the "father of French tragedy," the perfect fit.

Now I'm ready to construct the answer. The format is very simple. I'll state the figure and confirm the match against the user's requirements.

The historical figure who was born in 1606, died in 1684, and is known as a leading French tragedian is Pierre Corneille.
