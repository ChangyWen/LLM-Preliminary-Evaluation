Okay, let's see, the user wants a name, a historical figure. Right, got it. So, let me pull out the important facts. Born 1821, died 1867... okay, that's a good starting point. French poet, essayist, and art critic... Ah, this narrows things down considerably. French, 19th century... the dates are crucial.

Alright, let's see, what immediately springs to mind? Gotta run a quick check through the internal database. I'll search based on those dates and the profession. "French poet 1821-1867"... "French art critic 1821-1867"... and, just to be sure, let's throw in "Les Fleurs du mal author" as a cross-reference.

The first name that comes to mind is Baudelaire. Now, time to cross-check, to make sure everything aligns perfectly. Let's get specific. Born April 9, 1821... check. Died August 31, 1867... check. French, of course. Poet, essayist, and art critic... check, check, check. *Les Fleurs du mal*… that's the one. *Le Spleen de Paris*… yep. Essays on art, the "Painter of Modern Life"… okay, it's all matching up.

Yep, that's him. Undeniably Charles Baudelaire. 19th-century French poet, incredibly influential. Perfect.

So, I can put together the answer now. Straightforward, clearly answering the question. And the formatting instructions, the new line at the end, I have to make sure to include that. The intro is important, setting it up.

Okay, so it'll be, "The historical figure who was born in 1821, died in 1867, and is known as a French poet, essayist, and art critic is Charles Baudelaire."

And on a new line, as instructed:

Charles Baudelaire
