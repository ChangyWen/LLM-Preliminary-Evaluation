Okay, the user needs the name of a historical figure. Right. Let's see... The constraints are: born in 1770, died in 1827, and known for being a German composer of the classical and romantic periods. Okay, that's a very specific request.

First, that timeframe – 1770 to 1827 – really pinpoints the late Classical and early Romantic eras in music. Being German further narrows the field. Mozart is out; he died in '91. Bach is too early. Haydn's out too. Schubert...born '97 and died in '28. Close, but no cigar. Schumann and Brahms? Way too late. Hmm... Who fits the bill? Let's think. Beethoven! I'm thinking Beethoven. Let me check the details. Born 1770, right? Yes, absolutely, 1770. Died in 1827? Yep, March 26th, 1827. And, of course, he's known as one of the most influential composers, absolutely central to that transition from the Classical period to the Romantic. German too. Bingo. It's Beethoven. The historical figure you're referring to is Ludwig van Beethoven.
