*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1214, died in 1270, and is known as the 'king of France'. I need to recall who that might be.

I know that Louis IX is a famous king of France. He was canonized as a saint, which is unusual for a king. Let me check his birth and death years.

Louis IX was born in 1214 and died in 1270. That matches the dates given in the question.

He is indeed known as the king of France. His full title was Louis IX of France.

Now, to confirm, are there any other kings of France born in 1214 or died in 1270? Let me think about the sequence of French kings.

Before Louis IX, there was Louis VIII, who reigned from 1223 to 1226. Louis IX succeeded him and reigned from 1226 to 1270. Yes, that fits.

Born in 1214: Louis IX was born on April 25, 1214.

Died in 1270: He died on August 25, 1270, during the Eighth Crusade.

So, the details match perfectly.

The question specifies "known for 'king of France'", which is straightforward. It's likely referring to his title.

Finally, I need to provide the answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, my final answer should be: Louis IX

The question says "the name of the historical figure", so probably just "Louis IX" is sufficient, as that's how he's commonly known.

To be precise, he is often referred to as Saint Louis, but the question specifies "king of France", so "Louis IX" should be fine.

I think I'm ready to box the answer.
