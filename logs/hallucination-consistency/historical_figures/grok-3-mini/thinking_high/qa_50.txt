First, the question asks for a historical figure with specific details: born in 1622, died in 1673, and known as a "French playwright and actor."

I need to recall who this might be. I'm thinking of famous French figures from that era. The 17th century is the time of Louis XIV, and there were many prominent writers and artists.

The name that comes to mind is Molière. Let me verify his birth and death years. I think Molière was born in 1622 and died in 1673. Yes, that sounds right. He was a famous French playwright and actor, known for plays like Tartuffe and The Misanthrope.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think. Racine and Corneille were also French playwrights, but their birth and death years don't match. Racine was born in 1639 and died in 1699, and Corneille was born in 1606 and died in 1684. So, neither matches 1622-1673.

What about other figures? Voltaire was much later, born in 1694. No, that's not it. Or perhaps some actor, but Molière is the most prominent one who fits all criteria.

Confirming Molière's details: Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, known by his stage name Molière, was indeed born on January 15, 1622, and died on February 17, 1673. He was a key figure in French theater, both as a playwright and an actor.

The question specifies "French playwright and actor," which perfectly describes Molière.

Now, the response should end with the final answer on a new line. So, I'll structure my response accordingly.

Final answer: Molière

I should probably use his common name, which is Molière, as that's how he's known historically.
