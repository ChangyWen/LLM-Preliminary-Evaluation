*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure with specific details: born in 1822, died in 1895, and known as a 'French chemist and microbiologist'.

I need to recall who that might be. I think of famous scientists from that era. Louis Pasteur comes to mind. Let me verify his details.

Louis Pasteur was a French scientist. He worked in chemistry and microbiology. He developed pasteurization, vaccines, and contributed to germ theory.

Now, check the birth and death years. Pasteur was born in 1822 and died in 1888. Wait, is that right? I think he died in 1895. Let me double-check that.

Upon thinking, I recall Pasteur was born on December 27, 1822, and died on September 28, 1895. Yes, that matches: born 1822, died 1895.

He is indeed known as a French chemist and microbiologist. He started as a chemist and later moved into microbiology, making key discoveries in both fields.

Are there any other figures that might fit this description? Let me think. Another famous French scientist is Marie Curie, but she was born in 1867 and was a physicist and chemist, not primarily a microbiologist, and she wasn't born in 1822.

Pierre Curie was born in 1859, so no.

Antoine Lavoisier was a chemist, but he lived in the 18th century, born 1743, died 1794.

So, Louis Pasteur seems to be the correct answer.

The question says "known for 'French chemist and microbiologist'", which is in quotes, probably indicating that's the description given.

Finally, I need to provide the answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, my response should end with the name on a new line.

Let me structure it: I can have some reasoning, but since the instruction is to reason step by step, I'll include that, and then put the final answer.

Final answer: Louis Pasteur

Make sure the format is correct. It says "in a new line at the end of your response." So, probably something like:

[My reasoning here]

Then, on a new line: Louis Pasteur

Yes.

The historical figure who matches the given details—born in 1822, died in 1895, and known as a French chemist and microbiologist—is Louis Pasteur. He was a pioneering scientist whose work in chemistry and microbiology led to breakthroughs such as the development of pasteurization, vaccines for diseases like rabies and anthrax, and the establishment of the germ theory of disease.
