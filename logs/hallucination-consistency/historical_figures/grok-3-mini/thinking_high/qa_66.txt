First, the question asks for a historical figure with specific details: born in 1932, died in 1986, and known for being a Soviet and Russian filmmaker, writer, film editor, film theorist, and theatre and opera director.

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds familiar. I think it's Andrei Tarkovsky. Let me verify the details.

Andrei Tarkovsky was a famous filmmaker. He was Soviet-born and later associated with Russia. His birth and death years: I believe he was born in 1932 and died in 1986. Yes, that matches.

Confirming his roles: He was indeed a filmmaker, known for films like "Solaris" and "Stalker." He was also a writer, film editor, film theorist, and he directed theatre and opera. That fits.

Is there anyone else who might fit this description? Let me think. Sergei Eisenstein was earlier, born in 1898, died in 1948, so not him. Other filmmakers like Sergei Parajanov or others don't match the birth and death years.

Tarkovsky's death in 1986 was due to cancer, and he was exiled or had issues with the Soviet regime, but he is still classified as Soviet and Russian.

The question specifies "Soviet and Russian," which makes sense because the Soviet Union dissolved later, but Tarkovsky is often referred to in that context.

I think Andrei Tarkovsky is the correct answer.

Now, the question says to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be concise, but since it's an AI, I can have a bit of reasoning, but the final answer should be clear.

Final answer: Andrei Tarkovsky

Make sure the spelling is correct: Andrei Tarkovsky. Yes.
