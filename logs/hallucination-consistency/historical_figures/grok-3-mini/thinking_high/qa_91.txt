*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure with specific details: born in 1800, died in 1849, and known as the 'Slovene national poet, a Carniolan Romantic poet of Slovene descent'.

I need to recall who this might be. I'm thinking about famous poets from that region and time period. Carniola is a historical region that is now part of Slovenia, so this person is associated with Slovene culture.

The description matches France Prešeren. Let me verify his birth and death years. I believe France Prešeren was born in 1800 and died in 1849. Yes, that sounds right.

Confirming his titles: He is indeed considered the Slovene national poet and a key figure in Slovene Romantic literature. He was from Carniola, which is in present-day Slovenia.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? I don't think so. Prešeren is a well-known figure in Slovenian history and literature.

Just to be thorough, let's recall some facts: He wrote poems in Slovene, and his work is foundational for Slovene national identity. His most famous work is probably the poem that became the Slovene national anthem.

So, the answer should be France Prešeren.

The question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I'll structure my response accordingly.

Final Answer: France Prešeren
