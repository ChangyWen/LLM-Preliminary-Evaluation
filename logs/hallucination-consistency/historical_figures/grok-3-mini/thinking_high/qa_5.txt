First, the question asks for a historical figure with specific details: born in 1770, died in 1827, and known as a "German classical and romantic composer."

I need to recall who fits this description. The birth year is 1770 and death year is 1827. That lifespan sounds familiar. I think of Ludwig van Beethoven. Let me confirm his dates.

Beethoven was born in 1770 and died in 1827. Yes, that's correct. He is often considered a bridge between the Classical and Romantic periods in music, so he fits the description of a "German classical and romantic composer."

Is he German? Beethoven was born in Bonn, which was part of the Holy Roman Empire at the time, and he is generally considered German. That checks out.

Are there any other composers who might fit this? Let's think. Franz Schubert was born in 1797 and died in 1828, so that's not a match. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in 1756 and died in 1791, too early. Johann Sebastian Bach was born in 1685 and died in 1750, way off. Franz Liszt was born in 1811, too late.

What about Carl Maria von Weber? He was a German composer, born in 1786 and died in 1826. Close, but not exact—birth year is wrong (1786 vs. 1770), and death year is 1826 vs. 1827.

Beethoven is the clear match. He is famously known for his symphonies and piano works, and his music spans both Classical and Romantic styles.

The question specifies "German classical and romantic composer," and Beethoven is indeed often described that way.

Finally, the response should end with the name on a new line. So, I'll write my reasoning and then put the answer separately.

Answer: Ludwig van Beethoven
