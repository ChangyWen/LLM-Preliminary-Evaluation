*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1807, died in 1887, and described as a 'German philosopher, writer and politician (1807-1887)'.

I need to recall who this might be. The description matches Karl Marx. Let me confirm the dates: Karl Marx was born on May 5, 1818, and died on March 14, 1883. That doesn't match. 1818 and 1883 are not 1807 and 1887.

The user said born in 1807 and died in 1887. That's not Marx. Who else could it be?

Let me think of other German philosophers. Perhaps it's a mistake, or maybe it's someone else. The description says 'German philosopher, writer and politician'.

Born in 1807: Who was born in 1807? I know Charles Darwin was born in 1809, not 1807. Abraham Lincoln in 1809. Hmm.

Perhaps it's Karl Marx, but the dates are wrong. No, Marx is 1818-1883.

Maybe it's Friedrich Engels? Engels was born in 1820 and died in 1895, not matching.

Let's think of other figures. What about Otto von Bismarck? He was a German politician. Born in 1815, died in 1898. Not 1807.

Born in 1807: Let me recall. Perhaps Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel? Hegel was born in 1770 and died in 1831, too early.

Maybe Arthur Schopenhauer? Born in 1788, died in 1860, not matching.

Perhaps the user meant Karl Marx, but misstated the dates. But the user specifically said 1807-1887.

Let's double-check the description: 'German philosopher, writer and politician (1807-1887)'. Maybe it's not Marx.

Who was born in 1807? I think of SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, but he was Danish, not German. Born in 1813.

Perhaps it's Karl August Varnhagen von Ense or someone, but I'm not sure.

Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 1818-1883 for Marx.

But the user said 1807-1887. Let me think: is there a famous German figure with those dates?

Upon searching my knowledge, I recall that Karl Marx is often associated with those roles, but dates don't match.

Perhaps it's Wilhelm von Humboldt? He was born in 1767 and died in 1835.

Not matching.

Maybe it's Max Stirner? He was a philosopher, born in 1806, died in 1856. Close but not 1807 and 1887.

1806 is close to 1807, but death is wrong.

Perhaps Ludwig Feuerbach? Born in 1804, died in 1872. Not matching.

Born in 1807: I think of Richard Wagner, but he was a composer, not primarily a philosopher or politician. Born in 1813.

Perhaps the figure is Karl Marx, and the dates are incorrect in the query. But I should answer based on the description.

Maybe it's Otto von Bismarck again, but dates don't match.

Let's think differently. Perhaps it's a less known figure, but the description sounds like Marx.

Another thought: the years 1807-1887 might be for someone else. Let me recall: Georg Brandes was a Danish critic, not German.

Perhaps Heinrich Heine? He was a German poet and writer, born in 1797, died in 1856. Not matching.

Born in 1807: I found online in my mind that Karl Marx is the one, but dates are wrong. No, I think the user might have meant Marx, but let's confirm the dates.

Upon double-checking, Karl Marx: 1818-1883. Definitely not 1807-1887.

Who died in 1887? Let's think of deaths in 1887. I know Emily Dickinson died in 1886, not German.

Perhaps Bismarck was alive, but he died in 1898.

Let's search for German figures born in 1807.

After thinking, I recall that Karl Marx is the most famous with similar description, but dates don't match. Perhaps it's a mistake, and it's Marx.

Maybe it's Friedrich Nietzsche, but he was born in 1844.

Another idea: perhaps it's Wilhelm I of Germany, but he was born in 1797 and died in 1888. Close, born 1797, died 1888, not 1807-1887.

1807 birth: let's think of scientists or others. Michael Faraday was English, born 1791.

Perhaps the figure is Karl Marx, and the years are typo.

But the user said "is known for 'German philosopher, writer and politician (1807-1887)'", which might be a quote from somewhere with wrong dates.

Perhaps it's Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, but he died in 1831.

I think I have it: perhaps it's a reference to Karl Marx, and the dates are incorrect.

But to answer accurately, I need to find who was born in 1807 and died in 1887.

After recalling, I think it might be Karl Theodor Robert, but I'm not sure.

Upon further reflection, I believe the historical figure is likely Karl Marx, and the dates might be misremembered. But let's confirm with the description.

Perhaps it's Otto von Bismarck, but born 1815.

Let's calculate: born 1807, died 1887, age 80.

Marx was 64 when he died.

Another German philosopher: Arthur Schopenhauer died in 1860.

Perhaps it's Jacob Grimm or Wilhelm Grimm, but they were linguists, born in 1785 and 1786, died in 1863 and 1859.

Not matching.

I think I need to conclude that the figure is Karl Marx, as he is the most famous with that description, and the dates might be wrong.

But the user specified the dates, so perhaps it's someone else.

Let's think of politicians: perhaps Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, but he was Italian.

German: perhaps the figure is Karl August Varnhagen von Ense, a writer and diplomat, born 1785, died 1858. Not matching.

Perhaps it's Alexander von Humboldt, born 1769, died 1859.

Not.

I found a possibility: Karl Gutzkow, a German writer, born 1811, died 1878. Not.

Born in 1807: I recall that Karl Marx's collaborator, but no.

Perhaps the user meant 1818-1883, but wrote 1807-1887 by mistake.

Maybe it's Friedrich Engels, born 1820-1895.

Close but not.

Another thought: the years 1807-1887 might be for Napoleon III or someone, but he was French.

I think I have to go with Karl Marx, as he fits the description except for dates.

But to be precise, let's assume the dates are correct, and find who it is.

Upon searching my knowledge, I think it might be Karl Marx, and the dates are a typo.

Perhaps it's Wilhelm Liebknecht or someone, but he was born in 1826.

I recall that Karl Marx is often listed with those roles.

Perhaps it's Otto von Bismarck, but dates don't match.

Let's check online in my mind: I think the figure is Karl Marx.

Perhaps the user meant the years for someone else.

Another idea: the description ' (1807-1887)' might be part of the name or something, but no.

I think I should answer Karl Marx, as it's the most likely.

But to be accurate, let's confirm the dates for Marx: 1818-1883.

Perhaps it's a different person. Let's think of German philosophers born in 1807.

After thinking, I recall that Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach was born in 1804, close.

But not.

Perhaps it's Karl Follen or someone, but I'm not sure.

I think I need to conclude that the historical figure is Karl Marx, and perhaps there's a mistake in the dates.

So, I'll go with Karl Marx.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
The description provided matches Karl Marx, who is widely known as a German philosopher, writer, and politician. However, his actual birth and death dates are 1818 and 1883, respectively, not 1807 and 1887. It is possible that the dates in the query are incorrect or refer to a less prominent figure, but based on the description, Karl Marx is the most fitting historical figure.

Karl Marx
