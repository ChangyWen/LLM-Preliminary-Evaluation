*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1802, died in 1885, and described as a "French poet, novelist, and dramatist (1802-1885)."

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds familiar. I think it's Victor Hugo. Let me confirm the dates: Victor Hugo was born in 1802 and died in 1885. Yes, that's right.

Victor Hugo is indeed a French poet, novelist, and dramatist. He's famous for works like "Les Misérables" and "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame."

The description matches perfectly: "French poet, novelist, and dramatist (1802-1885)."

I should make sure there isn't another figure who fits this description. Let me think: Other famous French writers from that era include Balzac or Dumas, but their birth and death years don't match.

- Honoré de Balzac: Born 1799, died 1850. Not matching.

- Alexandre Dumas: Born 1802, died 1870. Born in 1802, but died in 1870, not 1885.

Dumas was born in 1802, same as Hugo, but he died in 1870. So, not him.

Victor Hugo is the one who lived until 1885.

Another one: Gustave Flaubert was born in 1821, died 1880. Doesn't match.

So, Victor Hugo is definitely the correct answer.

The question says to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be concise, and end with the answer on a new line.

Finally, the answer is Victor Hugo.
