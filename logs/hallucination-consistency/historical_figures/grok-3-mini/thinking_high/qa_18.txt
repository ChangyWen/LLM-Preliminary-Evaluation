First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1915, died in 2006, and known for being a general and politician of Chile. The description is given as 'General, politician of Chile (1915-2006)'.

I need to recall who this might be. From my knowledge, Augusto Pinochet comes to mind. He was a Chilean general and politician who ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990. Let me confirm his birth and death years.

Augusto Pinochet was born on November 25, 1915, and died on December 10, 2006. That matches the given years: 1915-2006.

He is famously known for being a general in the Chilean Army and then becoming the head of state after a military coup in 1973. He served as President of Chile until 1990 and was involved in significant political events, including human rights abuses.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think. Chile's history in the 20th century includes figures like Salvador Allende, but he was a politician, not a general, and he was born in 1908 and died in 1973. That doesn't match.

Another figure is Eduardo Frei Montalva, who was a politician and president, born in 1911 and died in 1982. Not a match.

Pinochet seems to be the clear fit. The description "General, politician of Chile" directly points to him.

The user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. Since the question is straightforward, I can confirm the details briefly if needed, but the user didn't ask for more information, just the name.

Finally, end with the name on a new line.
