First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1869, died in 1948, and known for being the "pre-eminent leader of Indian nationalism during the British Raj."

I need to recall who this person is. The description sounds familiar. The British Raj refers to the period of British rule in India, which ended in 1947. So, a leader of Indian nationalism during that time.

The years given are 1869-1948. That matches Mahatma Gandhi. Let me confirm his birth and death years. Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, and assassinated on January 30, 1948. Yes, that fits perfectly.

He's widely known as the pre-eminent leader of Indian nationalism, leading the non-violent resistance movement against British rule.

Are there any other figures who might fit this description? Let's think. Jawaharlal Nehru was born in 1889 and died in 1964, so that doesn't match. Subhas Chandra Bose was born in 1897 and died in 1945, not matching. Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born in 1871 and died in 1948, but he was more associated with the creation of Pakistan, not primarily Indian nationalism in the same way. The description specifies "Indian nationalism," which typically refers to the movement for India's independence as a whole, and Gandhi is the most prominent figure.

The phrase "pre-eminent leader" strongly points to Gandhi, as he's often called the father of the nation in India.

The question says to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be concise, but since it's an AI, I can provide a bit of reasoning, but the final answer should be on a new line.

Finally, the answer is Mahatma Gandhi.

Full name is Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, but he's commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. In historical contexts, "Mahatma Gandhi" is acceptable.

I think "Mahatma Gandhi" is fine.
