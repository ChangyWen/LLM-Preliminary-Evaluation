First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1707, died in 1778, and described as a "Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist (1707-1778)".

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds familiar. I think it's Carl Linnaeus. Let me confirm the details.

Carl Linnaeus was a famous Swedish scientist. He is known as the father of modern taxonomy, which involves classifying plants and animals. That fits with being a botanist and zoologist.

Now, check the birth and death years. I believe Linnaeus was born in 1707 and died in 1778. Yes, that matches.

He was also a physician, which aligns with the description.

The description says "Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist (1707-1778)", which directly points to Linnaeus.

I should make sure there isn't another figure who fits this description. I can't think of any other prominent scientist with those exact birth and death years and the same professions. Linnaeus is well-known for his work in binomial nomenclature.

The question asks to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my answer accordingly.

My response should be concise, and then end with the name on a new line.

Final answer: Carl Linnaeus

I should confirm the spelling. It's commonly known as Carl Linnaeus in English, though in Swedish it's Carl von Linn√© after he was ennobled. But the common reference is Carl Linnaeus.

Yes, that's standard.
