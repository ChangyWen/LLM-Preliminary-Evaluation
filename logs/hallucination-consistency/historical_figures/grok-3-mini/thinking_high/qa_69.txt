*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in -427, died in -347, and known as an 'ancient Greek philosopher'.

I need to interpret the years. The notation -427 and -347 likely means 427 BC and 347 BC, as negative numbers are often used to denote years before Christ in historical contexts. So, born in 427 BC and died in 347 BC.

Now, who is an ancient Greek philosopher that fits this timeline? I know that Plato is a famous ancient Greek philosopher. Let me recall his birth and death years.

From my knowledge, Plato was born in 427 BC and died in 347 BC. That matches perfectly.

Just to double-check, other famous Greek philosophers: Socrates was born around 470 BC and died in 399 BC, so that doesn't match. Aristotle was born in 384 BC and died in 322 BC, which is later. So, Plato is the one who fits.

The user specified "known for 'ancient Greek philosopher'", which is a bit vague, but given the exact dates, it's clearly pointing to Plato.

My response should end with the final answer on a new line. So, I'll write a brief explanation and then put the name on a new line.

Final answer should be: Plato

Make sure the format is correct. The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I'll structure my response like this:

- Start with a confirmation or brief explanation.

- End with the answer on a new line.
