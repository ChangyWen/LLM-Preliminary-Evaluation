*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure born in 1431, died in 1463, and known as a 'French poet and criminal'. I need to recall who that might be.

I know of François Villon. Let me check his birth and death years. I think he was born in 1431 and died around 1463. Yes, that sounds familiar. He was a French poet, and he had a criminal past, involved in theft and other crimes.

Confirming the details: Born in 1431, died in 1463. I believe Villon's exact death date is uncertain, but he's often said to have disappeared or died around 1463. That matches.

He is indeed known as a French poet. His most famous work is "Le Testament," and he wrote in the late Middle Ages. Also, he was involved in criminal activities, like being banished from Paris for his crimes.

Are there any other figures that fit this description? I can't think of anyone else born in 1431 and died in 1463 who is famous as a French poet and criminal. Joan of Arc was born in 1412 and died in 1431, so that's not it. Other French figures from that era don't match this profile.

So, François Villon seems to be the correct answer.

The question says to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should write my reasoning and then on a new line, just the name.

Final answer: François Villon
