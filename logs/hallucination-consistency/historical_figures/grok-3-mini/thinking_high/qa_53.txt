First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1639, died in 1699, and is known as a 'French dramatist'. I need to recall who that might be.

I know that Molière is a famous French dramatist. Let me check his birth and death years. I think Molière was born in 1622 and died in 1673. That doesn't match 1639-1699.

1639 to 1699. Who else is a French dramatist from that period? Maybe Racine or Corneille.

Jean Racine was a French playwright. I think he was born in 1639 and died in 1699. Let me confirm that.

Yes, Jean Racine was born on December 22, 1639, and died on April 21, 1699. That matches the dates perfectly.

He is indeed known as a French dramatist, famous for tragedies like Phèdre and Andromaque.

Now, just to make sure there isn't another figure with the same birth and death years. Pierre Corneille was born in 1606 and died in 1684, so that doesn't match. Molière, as I said, 1622-1673. Racine fits.

The question specifies 'French dramatist', and Racine is one of the most prominent ones.

So, my final answer should be Jean Racine.

The question says to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.
