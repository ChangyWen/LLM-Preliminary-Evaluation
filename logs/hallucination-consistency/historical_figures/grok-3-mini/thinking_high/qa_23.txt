First, the question asks for a historical figure with specific details: born in 1934, died in 1996, and known as an "American astrophysicist, cosmologist, author and science educator."

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds familiar. Let me think about famous scientists in astrophysics and cosmology.

Carl Sagan comes to mind. He was an American scientist, known for his work in astronomy and cosmology. He was also an author and a science educator, famous for the TV series "Cosmos."

Now, check the birth and death years. Carl Sagan was born in 1934 and died in 1996. Yes, that matches.

Confirm the details:

- Born: 1934 – Correct for Carl Sagan.

- Died: 1996 – Correct, he died from a disease related to bone marrow.

- Profession: American astrophysicist, cosmologist, author, and science educator – Perfect fit. He was involved in planetary science, popularized science through books and TV.

Are there any other figures that might fit this description?

Stephen Hawking was a cosmologist, but he was British, not American, and born in 1942, died in 2018. Doesn't match.

Neil deGrasse Tyson is an American astrophysicist and educator, but he was born in 1958 and is still alive. Not a match.

Carl Sagan seems to be the only one that fits all the criteria.

The question says "historical figure," and Sagan is indeed historical now.

Finally, the response should end with the name on a new line.

So, my answer is Carl Sagan.
