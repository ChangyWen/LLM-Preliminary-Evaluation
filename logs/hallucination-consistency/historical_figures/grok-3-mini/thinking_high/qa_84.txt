First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1798, died in 1834, and known as the "first Emperor of Brazil (1798-1834)".

I need to recall who this person is. I know that Brazil had an emperor, and the first one was Pedro I. Let me confirm the dates.

Pedro I of Brazil was born in 1798 and died in 1834. Yes, that matches. He was the son of King John VI of Portugal and declared Brazil's independence in 1822, becoming its first emperor.

The description says "first Emperor of Brazil (1798-1834)", which directly points to his birth and death years, so it's likely Pedro I.

I should make sure there isn't any other figure who fits this description. Brazil's imperial period was from 1822 to 1889, and Pedro I was indeed the first emperor. After him, his son Pedro II took over.

Pedro I abdicated in 1831 and died in 1834, which fits the death year. Born in 1798, yes.

The question specifies "known for 'first Emperor of Brazil (1798-1834)'", so it's straightforward.

My final answer should be the name of this person. I think it's Pedro I, but to be precise, he is often referred to as Dom Pedro I or Emperor Pedro I.

In historical contexts, he is commonly known as Pedro I of Brazil.

The question asks for the name, and in the description, it's given as part of the known for part, so I should just state the name.

Finally, I need to put the answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, my response should be concise, and end with the answer on a new line.
