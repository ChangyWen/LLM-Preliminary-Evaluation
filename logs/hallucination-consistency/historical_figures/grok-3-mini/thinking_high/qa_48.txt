First, the user is asking for a historical figure with specific details: born in 1775, died in 1836, and known as a "French physicist and mathematician."

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds familiar. I think it's André-Marie Ampère. Let me verify the details.

Ampère was a French physicist and mathematician. He is famous for his work in electromagnetism, and the unit of electric current is named after him.

Now, check the birth and death years. Ampère was born in 1775 and died in 1836. That matches perfectly.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think. Another famous French scientist is Laplace, but he was born in 1749 and died in 1827, which doesn't match. Or Fourier, born in 1768, died in 1830—not a match. Cauchy was born in 1789, too late. So, Ampère seems to be the correct one.

The user specified "French physicist and mathematician," and Ampère is indeed known for both fields, particularly for Ampère's law in electromagnetism.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. Since the user said "please give me your final answer," I don't need to add extra fluff, but I can confirm the details briefly if needed. However, to keep it concise, I'll just state the answer at the end.

Final answer should be: André-Marie Ampère

Make sure the spelling is correct: André-Marie Ampère, with the accent on the e.

Now, for the response format: I'll write a short confirmation and then the answer on a new line.
