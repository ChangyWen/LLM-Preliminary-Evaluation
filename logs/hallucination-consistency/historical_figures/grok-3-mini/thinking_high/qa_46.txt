First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in -69, died in -30, and is known for being the "last active pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt." I need to identify who that is.

The years are given with negative signs, which means BC (Before Christ). So, born in -69 is 69 BC, and died in -30 is 30 BC. That makes sense for ancient history.

Ptolemaic Egypt refers to the period when Egypt was ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty, which was founded by Ptolemy I Soter after the death of Alexander the Great. The last pharaoh of this dynasty should be Cleopatra VII.

Cleopatra VII is famously known as the last pharaoh of ancient Egypt, specifically of the Ptolemaic period. She was involved with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, and her death marked the end of the Ptolemaic kingdom.

Confirming the dates: Cleopatra VII was born in 69 BC and died in 30 BC. Yes, that matches: born in -69 (69 BC) and died in -30 (30 BC).

She is indeed known as the last active pharaoh. After her death, Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire.

I should make sure there aren't any other figures that fit this description. For example, her son Caesarion was technically a co-ruler, but he was killed shortly after her death and isn't considered the last active pharaoh. Cleopatra VII is the one historically recognized as the last ruler.

The question specifies "last active pharaoh," which emphasizes that she was actively ruling, unlike any nominal successors.

So, the answer should be Cleopatra.

Now, the question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I'll structure my response accordingly.

Final answer: Cleopatra

The historical figure who was born in 69 BC (denoted as -69), died in 30 BC (denoted as -30), and is known as the last active pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt is Cleopatra VII. She was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, ruled Egypt during a tumultuous period involving alliances with Roman leaders, and her death marked the end of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and the beginning of Roman rule in Egypt.

Cleopatra VII is often simply referred to as Cleopatra in historical contexts.
