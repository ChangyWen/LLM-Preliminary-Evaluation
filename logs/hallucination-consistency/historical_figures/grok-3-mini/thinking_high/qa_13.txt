First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1918, died in 2016, and known as a "Chilean politician and former president (1918-2016)."

I need to recall who this might be. The description matches Salvador Allende. Let me confirm his details.

Salvador Allende was a Chilean politician and served as President of Chile. He was born in 1908, not 1918. That doesn't match. Born in 1908, died in 1973. So, that's not him.

The birth year is 1918, death in 2016. Who else is a Chilean president born in 1918?

I think of Augusto Pinochet. He was a Chilean military general and dictator who served as President. Born in 1915? No, I think he was born in 1915 and died in 2006. That doesn't match either.

Birth year 1918, death 2016. Let me think of other Chilean presidents.

Perhaps it's Patricio Aylwin. He was the first president after Pinochet's dictatorship. I think he was born in 1918 and died in 2016. Let me confirm that.

Yes, Patricio Aylwin was born on November 26, 1918, and died on April 19, 2016. He was a Chilean politician and served as President from 1990 to 1994.

The description says "Chilean politician and former president (1918-2016)", which matches the birth and death years.

Is there anyone else? Let me double-check.

Another possibility: Eduardo Frei Montalva was president before Allende, born in 1911, died in 1982. Not matching.

Sebastian Pinera was president more recently, born in 1949, still alive or died later.

No, Patricio Aylwin seems to fit perfectly.

The question specifies "known for 'Chilean politician and former president (1918-2016)'", which directly points to Aylwin.

Just to be thorough, let's ensure there isn't a mistake. Is there any other Chilean president born in 1918?

I think Aylwin is the one. He was a key figure in Chile's transition to democracy.

So, my final answer should be Patricio Aylwin.

The question says to put the final answer in a new line at the end.
