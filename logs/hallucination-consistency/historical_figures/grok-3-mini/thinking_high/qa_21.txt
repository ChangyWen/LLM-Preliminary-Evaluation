First, the question asks for a historical figure with specific details: born in 1949, died in 2002, and known for being an American pornographic actress who later became an anti-porn activist.

I need to recall who this might be. I think of Linda Lovelace. She was involved in the adult film industry and later became an activist against pornography.

Let me verify the dates. Linda Lovelace was born in 1949 and died in 2002. Yes, that sounds right. She was born on January 10, 1949, and died on April 22, 2002.

Her claim to fame: She starred in the 1972 film "Deep Throat," which was a major pornographic film. Later, she became an anti-porn activist, writing books like "Ordeal" where she described her experiences and advocated against the industry.

Are there any other figures that fit this description? I can't think of anyone else with the exact same birth and death years and this specific career path. For example, other activists might not match the dates.

So, Linda Lovelace seems to be the correct answer.

The question says to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

Final answer: Linda Lovelace
