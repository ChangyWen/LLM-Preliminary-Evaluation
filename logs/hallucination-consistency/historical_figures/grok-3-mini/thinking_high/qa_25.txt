*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1713, died in 1784, and known as a 'French Enlightenment philosopher and encyclopædist'.

I need to recall who this might be. The term "encyclopædist" suggests involvement in the Encyclopédie, a major work of the Enlightenment. The Encyclopédie was edited by Denis Diderot.

Checking the birth and death years: Diderot was born in 1713 and died in 1784. That matches.

Confirming his background: He was French, a key figure in the Enlightenment, and indeed the main editor of the Encyclopédie.

Other Enlightenment figures: Voltaire was born in 1694 and died in 1778, so that doesn't match. Rousseau was born in 1712 and died in 1778, close but not exact, and he wasn't primarily known as an encyclopædist. Montesquieu was born in 1689 and died in 1755, way off.

Diderot fits perfectly: born 1713, died 1784, French, Enlightenment philosopher, and encyclopædist.

The question says to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since it's a reasoning exercise, I can include my thought process, but the final answer should be standalone.

Final answer: Denis Diderot.
