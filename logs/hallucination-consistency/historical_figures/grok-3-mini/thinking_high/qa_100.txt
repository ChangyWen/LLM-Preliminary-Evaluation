*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1803, died in 1869, and is known as a 'French Romantic composer'. I need to recall who that might be.

I know that Hector Berlioz is a famous French composer from the Romantic period. Let me check his birth and death years. I think he was born in 1803 and died in 1869. That sounds familiar.

Confirming: Berlioz was indeed born on December 11, 1803, and died on March 8, 1869. That matches the given years.

Is he known as a French Romantic composer? Absolutely, he's one of the key figures in French Romantic music, known for works like the Symphonie fantastique.

Are there any other composers who fit this description? Let's think. Chopin was Polish, not French. Liszt was Hungarian. Wagner was German. Verdi was Italian. So, for French composers, Berlioz is a prime candidate.

What about Bizet? He was born in 1838 and died in 1875, so that doesn't match. Debussy was born in 1862, too late. So, Berlioz seems to be the correct one.

The question specifies 'French Romantic composer', and Berlioz fits perfectly.

Now, the instruction is to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should write my reasoning and then put the answer separately.

Final answer should be: Hector Berlioz

Make sure the format is correct. The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I'll end with the name on a new line.
