*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1360, died in 1428, and is known as a "medieval Russian artist." I need to recall who that might be.

I remember Andrei Rublev. He's a famous Russian icon painter from the medieval period. Let me check his birth and death years. I think he was born around 1360 and died in 1430, but the question says died in 1428. That might not match.

Upon second thought, I recall that Andrei Rublev's exact birth and death dates are not precisely known, but he's often said to have been born around 1360 and died around 1430. But the question specifies born in 1360 and died in 1428. That could be approximate, or maybe it's a different person.

Is there another famous medieval Russian artist from that time? Rublev is the most prominent one. Let me confirm the dates. I think Rublev died in 1427 or 1428? I'm a bit fuzzy.

Perhaps it's Theophanes the Greek, but he was born earlier, around 1330-1340, and died around 1405-1410, which doesn't match.

Maybe it's Andrei Rublev, and the death year is close. I think some sources say he died in 1427 or 1428. Let me assume that's the case.

The question says "known for 'medieval Russian artist'", which is in quotes, so it might be a direct reference. Probably, it's Rublev.

To be thorough, let's think if there's anyone else. Dionysius? He was a Russian icon painter, but he lived later, born around 1440, which is after 1360.

So, Andrei Rublev seems to be the best fit. His birth is often given as c. 1360, and death as 1427 or 1430. The question says 1428, which is close enough; perhaps it's an approximation.

I think Rublev is the answer.

Now, the question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should lead to that, and then on a new line, say the name.

Final answer: Andrei Rublev

I should spell it correctly. It's usually Andrei Rublev in English.

Yes.
