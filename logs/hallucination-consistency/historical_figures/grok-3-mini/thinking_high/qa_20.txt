*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1904, died in 1996, and is known for being a Czech association football player during that period.

I need to recall or know who this person is. The description is specific: Czech association football player born in 1904 and died in 1996.

I'm thinking about famous Czech football players. One that comes to mind is Josef Bican. I believe he was a prolific goal scorer and played for Czechoslovakia.

Let me confirm the dates. Josef Bican was born in 1913, not 1904. That doesn't match. So, it's not him.

Perhaps it's another player. Let me think about other Czech football legends. What about Oldřich Nejedlý? I think he was part of the 1934 and 1938 World Cup teams for Czechoslovakia.

Recalling Nejedlý's dates: I think he was born in 1909 or something. Not sure. Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps it's Antonín Puč. I recall he was a Czech footballer who played in the 1930s and 1940s.

Let me try to remember: Antonín Puč was born in 1907 and died in 1988. That doesn't match the 1904-1996 dates.

The dates given are 1904-1996. So, born in 1904, died in 1996.

Who could that be? Maybe it's František Plánička. He was a goalkeeper for Czechoslovakia.

Plánička was born in 1904, I think. Yes, and he died in 1996. That sounds familiar.

Confirming: František Plánička is often regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in football history. He was part of the Czechoslovakia team that reached the 1934 World Cup final.

Born in 1904, died in 1996. That matches the dates.

Is he known as a Czech association football player? Yes, definitely.

The description says "Czech association football player (1904-1996)", which seems to point directly to him.

But just to be thorough, are there any other players with those exact dates?

Another name that comes to mind is Oldřich Nejedlý, but he was born in 1909 and died in 1990, I think. Not matching.

Josef Bican was born in 1913, died in 2001. No.

What about Karel Kolský? I'm not sure.

I think František Plánička is the correct one.

The question specifies "known for 'Czech association football player (1904-1996)'", which might be a direct quote or a description from a database or something.

So, probably, it's Plánička.

Now, the answer should be his name. I need to spell it correctly. František Plánička.

In English, it might be written as Frantisek Planicka, but I should use the proper diacritics if possible.

Since the question is in English, perhaps the standard English spelling is fine.

But in the response, I should provide the name as accurately as possible.

Finally, the instruction is to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should lead to that.

Let me outline my thought process briefly in the response, but since it's an AI, I can just state it.

Actually, the user asked me to reason step by step, so I should include that.

But in the end, put the answer in a new line.
