*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details: born in 1879, died in 1953, and described as 'Soviet politician, general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and premier of the Soviet Union (1878-1953)'.

There's a slight discrepancy in the years. The user says born in 1879, but the description has (1878-1953). I need to check that. The description says "premier of the Soviet Union (1878-1953)", but the user specified born in 1879. That might be a typo in the user's query or in the description.

I know that Joseph Stalin was a prominent Soviet leader. Let me recall his birth and death years. Stalin was born on December 18, 1878, and died on March 5, 1953. Yes, that's standard historical fact.

The user said born in 1879, but historically it's 1878. Perhaps the user misspoke or there's a common mistake. The description provided matches Stalin: he was the general secretary of the Communist Party and served as premier (he was Chairman of the Council of Ministers, which is equivalent to premier).

Confirming the roles:

- General Secretary of the Communist Party: Stalin held this position from 1922 to 1952.

- Premier of the Soviet Union: He became Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars in 1941, and later Chairman of the Council of Ministers until his death in 1953.

The years in the description (1878-1953) match Stalin's life span, not 1879. The user probably meant 1878 or it's a minor error.

Is there any other figure who fits this description? Lenin was born in 1870 and died in 1924, so no. Khrushchev was born in 1894, died in 1971. No one else fits the bill.

So, despite the user's mention of 1879, it's likely a mistake, and the figure is Joseph Stalin.

My final answer should be the name: Joseph Stalin.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So I'll structure my response accordingly.

Response structure: I can briefly acknowledge the query and confirm, but since the instruction is to reason step by step and then give the answer, I'll do that.

Final answer: Joseph Stalin
