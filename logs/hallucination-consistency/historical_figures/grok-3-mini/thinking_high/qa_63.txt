*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1879, died in 1941, and known as a "Chilean politician and President (1879-1941)". The years in parentheses match the birth and death years, so it's likely referring to someone who was president of Chile during that period or is identified by those years.

I need to recall who this might be. I'm thinking about Chilean presidents. I know that Arturo Alessandri was a president of Chile. Let me check his dates. I think he was born in 1868 and died in 1950. That doesn't match 1879-1941.

Perhaps it's someone else. Let me think about other Chilean presidents. What about Juan Antonio Ríos? I think he was president from 1942 to 1946, but his birth and death might not match.

The description says "Chilean politician and President (1879-1941)", which probably means the person lived from 1879 to 1941 and was a president. So I need to find a Chilean president born in 1879 and died in 1941.

Let me recall: I think it might be Arturo Alessandri, but his dates are wrong. Perhaps it's someone else. What about Pedro Aguirre Cerda? I think he was president from 1938 to 1941. Let me check his birth year. I believe he was born in 1879 and died in 1941. Yes, that sounds familiar.

Confirming: Pedro Aguirre Cerda was a Chilean politician, served as President of Chile from 1938 until his death in 1941. And he was born on February 6, 1879, and died on November 25, 1941. That matches perfectly.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think. Another famous Chilean president is Salvador Allende, but he was born in 1908 and died in 1973, so no. Or Augusto Pinochet, born 1915, died 2006. Not matching.

What about Carlos Ibáñez del Campo? He was president twice, born in 1877 and died in 1960, close but not exact. Born in 1877, not 1879.

So Pedro Aguirre Cerda seems to be the one. The description says "known for 'Chilean politician and President (1879-1941)'", which directly points to his lifespan.

Just to be thorough, let me make sure there isn't a mistake. The years 1879-1941 are specific, and Pedro Aguirre Cerda fits.

Finally, the question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my answer should be: Pedro Aguirre Cerda

I think that's it.
