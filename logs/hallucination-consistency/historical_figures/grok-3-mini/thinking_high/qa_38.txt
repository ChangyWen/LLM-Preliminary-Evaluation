First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1807, died in 1882, and described as 'Italian general, patriot and republican (1807-1882)'.

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds familiar. I think it's Giuseppe Garibaldi. Let me verify the dates and the description.

Giuseppe Garibaldi was an Italian general and patriot, a key figure in the Italian unification, known as the Risorgimento. He was indeed a republican.

Confirming the dates: Born in 1807 and died in 1882. Yes, that's correct for Garibaldi. He was born on July 4, 1807, and died on June 2, 1882.

The description matches perfectly: Italian general, patriot, and republican.

I should ensure there isn't another figure who fits this description. The dates are specific, and Garibaldi is the most prominent figure with these attributes. Other Italian figures like Mazzini or Cavour don't match the dates or the description as closely.

Mazzini was born in 1805 and died in 1872, so not matching. Cavour was born in 1810 and died in 1861. So, Garibaldi is the one.

The question says to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be concise, and then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer should be: Giuseppe Garibaldi

Make sure the spelling is correct: Giuseppe Garibaldi.
