*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1265, died in 1321, and known as 'Italian poet (1265–1321)'. I need to recall who that is.

I know that Dante Alighieri is a famous Italian poet. He wrote the Divine Comedy, which is a major work in literature. Let me confirm his birth and death years. I think Dante was born in 1265 and died in 1321. Yes, that matches the given dates.

The description 'Italian poet (1265–1321)' directly points to Dante. He's often referred to in that way in historical contexts.

Are there any other Italian poets born in 1265 and died in 1321? I don't think so. Dante is the most prominent figure from that era with those exact dates.

Just to be thorough, let's recall some other Italian poets. For example, Petrarch was born later, in 1304, and Boccaccio in 1313, so they don't match. Earlier poets like Guido Cavalcanti were contemporaries but not with the same birth and death years.

So, it's clear that the historical figure is Dante Alighieri.

The question says to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

Final answer: Dante Alighieri

I need to put it in a new line. So, perhaps end with:

Dante Alighieri

And make sure it's clear.
