First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1844, died in 1896, and is known as a "French poet." I need to recall who that might be.

I know several famous French poets. One that comes to mind is Arthur Rimbaud. Let me check his birth and death years. I think Rimbaud was born in 1854, not 1844. That doesn't match.

Another famous French poet is Paul Verlaine. I think he was born in 1844. Let me confirm: yes, Paul Verlaine was born in 1844 and died in 1896. That sounds right.

Let me double-check the years. Paul Verlaine: born October 30, 1844, and died January 8, 1896. Yes, that matches the given dates.

Is he known as a French poet? Absolutely, he's one of the most prominent figures in French poetry, associated with the Symbolist movement.

Are there any other French poets born in 1844 and died in 1896? I can't think of any off the top of my head. Rimbaud was born later, and others like Baudelaire died earlier (1867), or Mallarm√© lived longer (died in 1898).

So, Paul Verlaine seems to be the correct answer.

The question says "known for 'French poet'", which might be a bit awkwardly phrased, but it's clear it means he is famous as a French poet.

Finally, I need to give the answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, my response should end with the name on a new line.
