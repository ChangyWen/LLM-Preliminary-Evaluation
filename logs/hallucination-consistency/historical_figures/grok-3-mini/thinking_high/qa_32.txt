*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1783, died in 1842, and is known as a "19th century French writer." I need to recall who that might be.

I know several famous French writers from the 19th century. For example, Victor Hugo, but I think he was born in 1802 and died in 1885, so that doesn't match the birth and death years.

The birth year is 1783 and death in 1842. Who was born in 1783? I think of Honor√© de Balzac. Let me confirm his dates. I believe Balzac was born in 1799, no, that might be wrong. Actually, I think Balzac was born in 1799 and died in 1850. That doesn't match.

Let me think of other French writers. Stendhal? Stendhal was born in 1783, I think. Yes, Marie-Henri Beyle, known as Stendhal, was born in 1783 and died in 1842. That sounds right.

Confirming: Stendhal is indeed a 19th-century French writer, famous for novels like "The Red and the Black" and "The Charterhouse of Parma." His birth and death dates match: 1783-1842.

Are there any other writers who fit this description? Let's see, Alexandre Dumas was born in 1802, so no. Victor Hugo, as I said, 1802-1885. Balzac, 1799-1850. Chateaubriand was born in 1768 and died in 1848, so birth year doesn't match. Lamartine was born in 1790, not 1783.

So, Stendhal seems to be the correct answer.

The question specifies "known for '19th century French writer'", which is a bit vague, but given the dates, it points directly to Stendhal.

Finally, I need to put the answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I'll write my reasoning and then on a new line, just the name.

Answer: Stendhal
