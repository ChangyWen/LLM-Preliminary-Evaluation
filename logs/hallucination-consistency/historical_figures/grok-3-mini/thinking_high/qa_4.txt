First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1756, died in 1791, and is known as an "Austrian composer of the Classical period."

I need to recall who that might be. The Classical period in music is roughly from 1750 to 1820, and famous composers from that era include Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven. Beethoven is a bit later, and he's German, not Austrian.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in 1756 and died in 1791. That matches the birth and death years.

Is Mozart Austrian? He was born in Salzburg, which was part of the Holy Roman Empire at the time, and Salzburg is now in Austria, so he's often considered an Austrian composer. Yes, that fits.

Haydn was born in 1732 and died in 1809, so that doesn't match the birth and death years.

Beethoven was born in 1770 and died in 1827, so no.

Other composers: Bach was Baroque, not Classical. Handel was also Baroque.

So, Mozart seems to be the one.

The description says "Austrian composer of the Classical period," and Mozart is indeed known for that.

Just to be thorough, is there any other figure who might fit? I don't think so. Mozart is iconic for those dates.

The question says to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should lead to that, and then on a new line, just the name.

Final answer should be: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

Make sure the format is correct. It says "in a new line," so probably after my reasoning, I put it on a new line.
