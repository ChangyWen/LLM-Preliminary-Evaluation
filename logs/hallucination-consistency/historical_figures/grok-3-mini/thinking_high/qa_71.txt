*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in -384, died in -322, and known as an 'ancient Greek philosopher'.

I need to interpret the years. The notation -384 and -322 likely means 384 BC and 322 BC, as negative numbers are often used to denote years before Christ in some systems. So, born in 384 BC and died in 322 BC.

Now, who is a famous ancient Greek philosopher born around 384 BC and died around 322 BC? That sounds familiar. Aristotle comes to mind. Let me confirm his birth and death years.

From my knowledge, Aristotle was born in 384 BC and died in 322 BC. Yes, that matches perfectly.

He's definitely known as an ancient Greek philosopher. He's one of the most famous ones, along with Plato and Socrates.

Are there any other philosophers with similar birth and death years? Let's think:

- Socrates was born around 470 BC and died in 399 BC, so that doesn't match.

- Plato was born around 427 BC and died in 348 BC, also not matching.

- Aristotle's dates are indeed 384 BC to 322 BC.

The user specified 'ancient Greek philosopher', and Aristotle fits that description.

The user asks for the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward question, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line. So, something like: "The historical figure is Aristotle." on a new line.

To make it clear, I should say the name directly as per the instruction.
