First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details: born in 1809, died in 1882, and known for being a British naturalist and the author of "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection."

I need to recall who this person is. From my knowledge, this description matches Charles Darwin. He was a British naturalist, and he wrote "On the Origin of Species," which was published in 1859. His birth and death years are indeed 1809-1882.

Let me confirm the details:

- Born: 1809

- Died: 1882

- Nationality: British

- Profession: Naturalist

- Famous work: "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection"

Yes, that's Charles Darwin.

The user has provided the description in quotes: 'British naturalist, author of "On the origin of species, by means of natural selection" (1809-1882)'. This is essentially a direct reference to Darwin.

I need to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response, as instructed.

So, my response should be straightforward. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since the question is clear, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer format: It should be on a new line, so I'll write something like:

Charles Darwin

And make sure it's at the end.

To structure my response:

- I can start with a brief acknowledgment or confirmation.

- Then, end with the answer on a new line.

For example:

Based on the details provided, the historical figure is Charles Darwin.

[New line]

Charles Darwin

Or simply state it directly.

But to make it clear, I'll keep it concise.
