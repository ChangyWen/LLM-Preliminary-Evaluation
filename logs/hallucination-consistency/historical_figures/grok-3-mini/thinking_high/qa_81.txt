*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1890, died in 1974, and is known for being a "Russian architect and painter (1890-1974)".

I need to recall who this might be. The description matches someone famous in art and architecture from Russia.

I think of Kazimir Malevich. He was a Russian painter, known for Suprematism. But was he an architect? I'm not sure. Let me think.

Malevich was born in 1879, not 1890. So that doesn't match.

What about El Lissitzky? He was a Russian artist and architect, involved in Suprematism and Constructivism. When was he born? I think 1890. Let me confirm: yes, El Lissitzky was born in 1890 and died in 1941. Wait, 1941? The question says died in 1974, so that doesn't match.

Died in 1974, so it has to be someone who lived until then.

Another name: Wassily Kandinsky. He was a Russian painter, born in 1866, died in 1944. Not matching.

Perhaps it's not a painter I'm thinking of. The description says "architect and painter."

What about Konstantin Melnikov? He was a Russian architect, known for his innovative designs. Born in 1890? I think he was born in 1890 and died in 1974. Let me verify that.

Yes, Konstantin Melnikov was born on August 22, 1890, and died on November 28, 1974. He was a prominent Russian architect, and he also did some painting or was involved in art, but I'm not entirely sure about the painter part.

The description says "Russian architect and painter." Was Melnikov known as a painter? He was primarily an architect, but perhaps he dabbled in painting or is associated with art movements.

Maybe it's someone else. Let's think about Marc Chagall. He was a Russian-French artist, born in 1887, died in 1985. Not matching.

Ivan Leonidov? He was an architect, but born in 1902, died in 1959. No.

Perhaps it's Vladimir Tatlin. He was a Russian artist and architect, known for Constructivism. Born in 1885, died in 1953. Not 1890-1974.

Back to Melnikov. Upon second thought, Konstantin Melnikov is indeed born in 1890 and died in 1974. And he is often described as an architect, and while he might not be primarily known as a painter, perhaps in some contexts he is referred to as such, or maybe the description is approximate.

But the question specifically says "architect and painter," so it should be someone who is known for both.

Another name: Kazimir Malevich again, but birth year wrong.

What about Naum Gabo? He was a Russian sculptor and architect, born in 1890, died in 1977. Close, but died in 1977, not 1974, and sculptor, not necessarily painter.

Born in 1890, yes, but death year is 1977.

Perhaps it's El Lissitzky, but he died in 1941.

Let's search my memory for someone born in 1890 and died in 1974.

Perhaps it's not a visual artist. But the description is clear: Russian architect and painter.

Another thought: Wassily Kandinsky, but birth year 1866.

Perhaps I have the wrong person. Let's think about architects.

Konstantin Melnikov seems to fit the dates: 1890-1974.

Now, was he a painter? Upon recalling, Melnikov was primarily an architect, but he was part of the avant-garde art scene in Russia, and he might have engaged in painting or been associated with it. Perhaps the description is accurate.

Maybe it's Alexei Shchusev or someone, but Shchusev was born in 1873, died in 1949.

Perhaps it's Vladimir Mayakovsky, but he was a poet, not architect or painter.

Let's confirm Melnikov. I think he is the one. In many sources, he is listed as a Russian architect born 1890, died 1974.

For the painter part, perhaps he did some artistic work, or maybe the question has a slight inaccuracy, but based on the dates, it matches.

Another possibility: Pavel Filonov, but he was a painter, born 1883, died 1941.

Not matching.

Or Kazimir Severinovich Malevich, but 1879-1935.

I think Melnikov is the closest match.

Perhaps it's Le Corbusier, but he was Swiss-French, not Russian.

No.

Let's double-check the dates for Melnikov. Yes, Konstantin Stepanovich Melnikov (1890-1974), Russian architect.

Regarding "painter," maybe he is sometimes classified broadly as an artist, or perhaps he did paint.

Upon thinking, I recall that some architects of that era were multidisciplinary.

Perhaps the figure is Wassily Kandinsky, but dates don't match.

Another name: Antoine Pevsner, Russian sculptor and painter, born 1886, died 1962. Not matching.

Naum Gabo, born 1890, died 1977, close but not 1974.

Died in 1977, question says 1974.

Perhaps it's someone else.

Let's think about Marc Chagall again, but 1887-1985.

No.

Perhaps I have the wrong recollection. Let's think logically.

The description is given as "Russian architect and painter (1890-1974)", so likely it's a standard reference.

Upon searching my knowledge, I believe Konstantin Melnikov is the correct answer. He is often cited with those dates, and while he might not be famous as a painter, perhaps in the context, he is included.

Maybe it's Ivan Puni or something, but I don't think so.

Another thought: Vasily Kandinsky is sometimes misspelled, but dates wrong.

I think I should go with Konstantin Melnikov.

So, my final answer is Konstantin Melnikov.
