*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1945, died in 1981, and is known as a 'Jamaican singer, songwriter and musician'.

I need to recall who fits this description. The years are specific: born in 1945 and died in 1981. That means the person lived for 36 years.

The description is 'Jamaican singer, songwriter and musician'. So, I'm thinking of famous Jamaican musicians. Bob Marley comes to mind immediately. He was a reggae singer, songwriter, and musician from Jamaica.

Let me confirm the birth and death years for Bob Marley. I believe he was born in 1945 and died in 1981. Yes, that sounds right. He was born on February 6, 1945, and died on May 11, 1981, from cancer.

Is there anyone else who might fit this description? Let me think. Other famous Jamaican musicians include Jimmy Cliff or Peter Tosh, but I don't think their birth and death years match.

- Jimmy Cliff is still alive, born in 1948, so not him.

- Peter Tosh was born in 1944 and died in 1987, so not matching the years.

- Bob Marley is the one who matches: born 1945, died 1981.

The description says 'Jamaican singer, songwriter and musician', which perfectly describes Bob Marley. He's one of the most iconic figures in music history, especially known for reggae and his influence worldwide.

The question specifies to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my answer accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. Since the question is straightforward, I don't need to add extra information unless necessary. But to make it helpful, I can confirm the details briefly.

Final answer should be: Bob Marley

Make sure it's in a new line. So, I'll write my reasoning, then on a new line, put the name.
