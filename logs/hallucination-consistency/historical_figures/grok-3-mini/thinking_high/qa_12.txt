*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1564, died in 1642, and known as an Italian mathematician, physicist, philosopher, and astronomer.

I need to recall who this person is. The birth and death years are 1564-1642, and the description matches Galileo Galilei. Let me confirm that.

Galileo Galilei was born in 1564 and died in 1642. He was Italian and is famous for his work in mathematics, physics, philosophy, and astronomy. He made significant contributions like improving the telescope, supporting the heliocentric model, and his laws of motion.

Are there any other figures that might fit this description? Let's think:

- Isaac Newton was born in 1643 and died in 1727, so that doesn't match the years.

- Copernicus was born in 1473 and died in 1543, not matching.

- Kepler was born in 1571 and died in 1630, close but not exact, and he was German, not Italian.

- So, Galileo is the clear match.

The user specified "Italian mathematician, physicist, philosopher and astronomer," which perfectly describes Galileo.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since it's a straightforward question, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

Response structure:

- Acknowledge the query briefly.

- State the answer clearly at the end on a new line.
