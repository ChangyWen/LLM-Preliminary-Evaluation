First, the question asks for a historical figure with specific details: born in 1921, died in 1989, and known as a "Soviet nuclear physicist and human rights activist."

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds familiar. I think it's Andrei Sakharov. Let me verify the details.

Andrei Sakharov was a Soviet physicist who worked on nuclear weapons, often called the father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb. He was also a prominent human rights activist, winning the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.

Now, check the birth and death years. I believe Sakharov was born in 1921 and died in 1989. Yes, that matches.

Born: 1921 – correct.

Died: 1989 – correct.

Known for: Soviet nuclear physicist – yes, he was involved in the development of the Soviet atomic bomb.

Human rights activist – absolutely, he was a dissident who advocated for human rights and was exiled for his views.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? I can't think of another prominent figure with these exact details. For example, other Soviet physicists like Igor Kurchatov were involved in nuclear physics but not known for human rights activism. Kurchatov died in 1960, so that doesn't match.

Sakharov is the one who fits perfectly.

The question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

Final answer should be: Andrei Sakharov

Make sure the spelling is correct. It's Andrei Sakharov, with one 'h' in Sakharov, I think. Yes.

Response structure: I can have a brief reasoning, but since the instruction is to put the final answer in a new line, I'll keep it concise.
