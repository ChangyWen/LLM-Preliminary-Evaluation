First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1908, died in 1991, and is known as an "American physicist and engineer."

I need to recall who that might be. The description sounds familiar. Let me think about famous American physicists and engineers.

One name that comes to mind is Richard Feynman. But was he born in 1908? I think Feynman was born in 1918, not 1908. Let me confirm that. Yes, Feynman was born in 1918 and died in 1988, so that doesn't match.

Another famous physicist is Albert Einstein, but he was German-born and not American, and his birth and death years are 1879-1955, so no.

What about Robert Oppenheimer? He was involved in the Manhattan Project. Born in 1904, died in 1967. Not matching.

Born in 1908... who was born in 1908? Let me think. Enrico Fermi was Italian, born in 1901, died in 1954.

Perhaps it's someone like Edward Teller. He was a physicist involved in nuclear weapons. Born in 1908, yes! And he died in 2003, wait no, let me check. Edward Teller was born in 1908 and died in 2003, but the question says died in 1991, so not him.

Died in 1991. So, born 1908, died 1991.

Who else? Maybe John Bardeen. He was a physicist, known for transistors. Born in 1908, and died in 1991? Let me recall. John Bardeen was born in 1908 and died in 1991. Yes, that sounds right.

Confirming: John Bardeen was an American physicist and engineer, co-inventor of the transistor, and won two Nobel Prizes in Physics. Born May 23, 1908, and died January 30, 1991. That matches perfectly.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think. Another possibility could be someone like Vannevar Bush, but he was born in 1890 and died in 1974, so no.

Or perhaps Claude Shannon, but he was born in 1916 and died in 2001.

No, John Bardeen seems to fit.

The question says "known for 'American physicist and engineer'". It's a bit awkwardly phrased, but I think it means he is known as an American physicist and engineer.

John Bardeen was indeed both a physicist and an engineer, with degrees in electrical engineering and physics.

So, I think that's the answer.

Final answer should be John Bardeen.

The question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.
