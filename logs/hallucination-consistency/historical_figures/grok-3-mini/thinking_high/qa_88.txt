*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1821, died in 1881, and is known as a 'Russian author'. I need to recall who that might be.

I know several famous Russian authors. One that comes to mind is Fyodor Dostoevsky. Let me check his birth and death years. I think Dostoevsky was born in 1821 and died in 1881. Yeah, that sounds right.

Let me confirm that. Dostoevsky wrote books like Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, and he was indeed Russian. Born in 1821, died in 1881. That matches perfectly.

Are there any other Russian authors born in 1821 and died in 1881? Let me think. Leo Tolstoy was born in 1828 and died in 1910, so that's not it. Ivan Turgenev was born in 1818 and died in 1883, close but not exact. Nikolai Gogol was born in 1809 and died in 1852, way off. Alexander Pushkin was born in 1799 and died in 1837, not matching.

So, Dostoevsky seems to be the one. The question specifies 'Russian author', and Dostoevsky is famously known for that.

The question says "known for 'Russian author'", which might be a bit awkwardly phrased, but I think it means he is known as a Russian author. Probably just emphasizing his nationality and profession.

Now, the instruction is to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should write my reasoning and then put the answer separately.

Final answer should be: Fyodor Dostoevsky

I should make sure the name is spelled correctly. It's Fyodor Dostoevsky, sometimes spelled Dostoyevsky, but the common English spelling is Dostoevsky.

Also, confirm the years: Born November 11, 1821, died February 9, 1881. Yes, that's correct.

I think that's it.
