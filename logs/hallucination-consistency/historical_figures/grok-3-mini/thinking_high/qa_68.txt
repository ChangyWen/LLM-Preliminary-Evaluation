*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1858, died in 1930, and known as a Chilean politician and President. The description is given as 'Chilean politician and President (1858-1930)'.

I need to recall or know who this person is. From my knowledge, there's a famous Chilean president who fits this description. I think it's Arturo Alessandri Palma. Let me confirm the dates.

Arturo Alessandri was born in 1868, not 1858. That doesn't match. Born in 1868, died in 1950. That's not right.

Perhaps it's someone else. Let me think about Chilean presidents. Another one is José Manuel Balmaceda, but he was born in 1840 and died in 1891. Not matching.

The user specified born in 1858 and died in 1930. Let me think: is there a president born in 1858?

Perhaps it's Ramón Barros Luco. He was president of Chile from 1910 to 1915. Born in 1835, died in 1919. No, not that.

Maybe it's Pedro Montt. He was president from 1906 to 1910, born in 1849, died in 1910. Still not.

Let's think carefully. The description says 'Chilean politician and President (1858-1930)', which likely means the lifespan is 1858-1930, and he was a president.

Who was born in 1858 and died in 1930 and was a Chilean president?

I recall Emiliano Figueroa. He was president from 1925 to 1927, born in 1866, died in 1931. Close but not exact.

Perhaps it's Arturo Alessandri, but I think he was born in 1868. Let me double-check my knowledge.

Actually, upon second thought, I think the person might be Juan Luis Sanfuentes. He was president from 1915 to 1920, born in 1858, and died in 1930. Yes, that sounds right.

Let me confirm: Juan Luis Sanfuentes Andonaegui was a Chilean politician and served as President of Chile from 1915 to 1920. He was born on December 27, 1858, and died on July 16, 1930. That matches perfectly: born 1858, died 1930, and known as a Chilean politician and president.

Is there anyone else? Let me make sure. Another possibility could be misremembering, but Sanfuentes fits.

The user said 'known for 'Chilean politician and President (1858-1930)'', which directly points to the lifespan.

So, Juan Luis Sanfuentes is the answer.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be straightforward, and end with the name on a new line.
