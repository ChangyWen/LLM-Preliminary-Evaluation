*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1879, died in 1954, and is known as an "Australian writer and feminist."

I need to recall who this might be. I'm thinking of famous Australian writers and feminists from that era.

The birth year is 1879 and death in 1954. That means they lived through the early 20th century.

One name that comes to mind is Miles Franklin. I think she was an Australian writer. Let me confirm her details.

Miles Franklin wrote "My Brilliant Career," which is a famous Australian novel. She was indeed a feminist and involved in women's rights.

Now, her birth and death years: I believe Miles Franklin was born in 1879 and died in 1955. Wait, is that right? The question says died in 1954. Let me double-check.

Upon thinking, I recall that Miles Franklin was born on 14 October 1879 and died on 19 September 1954. Yes, that matches: born 1879, died 1954.

She is definitely known as an Australian writer and feminist. She was a key figure in Australian literature and advocated for women's rights.

Are there any other figures that might fit this description?

Let me think: Another famous Australian writer is Henry Lawson, but he was born in 1867 and died in 1922, so that doesn't match.

Christina Stead was a writer, but she was born in 1902, which is later.

Dame Mary Gilmore was a writer and feminist, born in 1865 and died in 1962, so birth year doesn't match.

Patrick White was born in 1912, too late.

So, Miles Franklin seems to be the correct one.

The question specifies "Australian writer and feminist," and Miles Franklin fits perfectly.

Just to be thorough, let's confirm the years: Born 1879, died 1954 â€“ yes.

She is often associated with the Miles Franklin Award, which is a literary award in Australia.

I think that's the answer.

The question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, I'll write my response and then on a new line, say "Miles Franklin".

The name is Stella Maria Sarah Miles Franklin, but she is commonly known as Miles Franklin.

The question asks for the name, so probably "Miles Franklin" is sufficient.

I don't think there's any other figure that matches exactly.

So, I'm confident.
