*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1842, died in 1898, and is known as a 'French Symbolist poet'. I need to recall who that might be.

I know that the Symbolist movement in poetry was prominent in France in the late 19th century. Some famous French poets from that era include Arthur Rimbaud, Paul Verlaine, and Stéphane Mallarmé.

Let me check the birth and death years:

- Arthur Rimbaud: Born in 1854, died in 1891. That's not 1842.

- Paul Verlaine: Born in 1844, died in 1896. Close, but not 1842 and 1898.

- Stéphane Mallarmé: Born in 1842, died in 1898. That matches perfectly.

Confirming Mallarmé's details: He was indeed a French poet associated with the Symbolist movement. He was born on March 18, 1842, and died on September 9, 1898. Yes, that fits.

Are there any other poets who might fit this description? Let me think.

- Charles Baudelaire is often linked to Symbolism, but he was born in 1821 and died in 1867, which doesn't match.

- Paul Valéry was born in 1871, too late.

- Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine are key figures, but their dates don't match.

So, Stéphane Mallarmé seems to be the correct answer.

The question specifies 'French Symbolist poet', and Mallarmé is definitively known for that.

Finally, the response should end with the answer on a new line. So, I'll write my reasoning and then put the name on a new line.
