*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1888, died in 1946, and known as a "Chilean politician and President (1888-1946)".

The description says "President (1888-1946)", but that can't be right because if someone was born in 1888 and died in 1946, they couldn't have been president from 1888 to 1946. That would mean they were president from birth to death, which is impossible. Probably, the "(1888-1946)" refers to the birth and death years, not the presidency years. Let me read the question again.

"What is the name of the historical figure who was born in 1888, died in 1946, and is known for 'Chilean politician and President (1888-1946)'?"

It says "known for 'Chilean politician and President (1888-1946)'". The "(1888-1946)" might be part of the description, but it's likely indicating the lifespan, not the term of presidency. Perhaps it's a bit poorly phrased, but in historical contexts, when we say "President (birth-death)", it might be a shorthand.

I need to recall who was a Chilean president born in 1888 and died in 1946.

Let me think about famous Chilean presidents. I know of Arturo Alessandri, but I'm not sure about his dates. Another one is Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, but I need to check the years.

Perhaps it's Arturo Alessandri Palma. Let me recall: Arturo Alessandri was a Chilean president. I think he was born in 1868, not 1888. Wait, no, let me think.

Maybe it's someone else. Let me try to remember.

Perhaps it's Juan Antonio Ríos. Let me think systematically.

I should list out Chilean presidents around that time.

From memory:

- Arturo Alessandri was president from 1920-1925 and 1932-1938. Born in 1868, died in 1950. Not matching.

Born in 1868, died 1950, not 1888-1946.

Next, Carlos Ibáñez del Campo: I think he was born in 1877 and died in 1960. Not matching.

Juan Esteban Montero: Born 1879, died 1948. Close but not exact.

Born 1879, died 1948, but the question says born 1888.

1888 is specific.

Perhaps it's Pedro Aguirre Cerda. He was president from 1938-1941, I think. Born in 1879, died 1941. Not 1888.

Maybe I have the wrong person.

Let's think: is there a Chilean president born in 1888?

Perhaps it's Gabriel González Videla. He was president from 1946-1952. Born in 1898, I think. Not 1888.

1898 is later.

Maybe I need to search my memory better.

Perhaps it's Arturo Alessandri's son, Jorge Alessandri, but he was later, born 1896, president in 1958-1964.

Not matching.

Let's calculate: born 1888, died 1946. So, he lived to be 58 years old.

Now, when was he president? The description says "President", but doesn't specify the years, just that he's known as such.

Perhaps the "(1888-1946)" is the lifespan, and he was president for some period within that.

Who was Chilean president and died in 1946?

I recall that Juan Antonio Ríos was president of Chile from 1942 to 1946, and he died in office in 1946.

What was his birth year? I think he was born in 1888.

Let me confirm: Juan Antonio Ríos Morales, born October 9, 1888, died June 27, 1946.

Yes, that matches: born 1888, died 1946, and he was a Chilean politician and president.

He served as President of Chile from 1942 until his death in 1946.

Perfect, that fits.

Is there anyone else? Let me make sure.

Another possibility: was there any other president born in 1888?

I think Juan Antonio Ríos is the one.

So, the historical figure is Juan Antonio Ríos.

Now, the question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, I should respond with the name.

But let me double-check the description: "known for 'Chilean politician and President (1888-1946)'". The "(1888-1946)" likely refers to his lifespan, as is common in biographical descriptions.

Yes.

So, the answer is Juan Antonio Ríos.
