First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1917, died in 1984, and known for being an Indian Prime Minister and politician (1917-1984).

I need to recall who this might be. The years given are 1917-1984, which matches the lifespan. The description is "Indian Prime Minister and politician."

I know that Indira Gandhi was an Indian Prime Minister. Let me confirm her birth and death years. She was born in 1917 and assassinated in 1984. Yes, that matches.

Is there any other Indian Prime Minister born in 1917? Let me think. Jawaharlal Nehru was born in 1889, died in 1964. Morarji Desai was born in 1896, died in 1995. Rajiv Gandhi was born in 1944, died in 1991. So, no, Indira Gandhi is the one who fits the birth year of 1917.

The description says "Indian Prime Minister and politician (1917-1984)", which directly points to Indira Gandhi.

Just to be thorough, is there any other figure who might fit? The years are specific, and the role is clear. It's unlikely to be someone else.

The question says to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be concise, but since it's an AI, I can provide a bit of reasoning, but the final answer should be on a new line.

Finally, the answer is Indira Gandhi.
