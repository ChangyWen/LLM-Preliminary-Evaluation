*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1867, died in 1935, and described as 'Polish politician, First Marshall and Prime Minister (1867-1935)'.

I need to recall who this might be. The description says "First Marshall" – I think that might be a typo or a specific title. In Polish history, there's a famous figure who was a Marshal and Prime Minister. I believe it's Józef Piłsudski.

Let me confirm the details:

- Born in 1867: Yes, Józef Piłsudski was born on December 5, 1867.

- Died in 1935: He died on May 12, 1935.

- Polish politician: Absolutely, he was a key figure in Polish independence and politics.

- First Marshall: I think this refers to "First Marshal of Poland." Piłsudski was indeed the first Marshal of Poland.

- Prime Minister: He served as Prime Minister of Poland twice, in 1918-1919 and 1926-1928.

The description says "First Marshall and Prime Minister," which matches Piłsudski.

The years in parentheses (1867-1935) match his birth and death years.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? I can't think of any other prominent Polish figure with those exact birth and death years and titles. Piłsudski is one of the most famous Polish leaders from that era.

Just to be thorough, let's consider if "First Marshall" could be misinterpreted. It might be a misspelling of "First Marshal," which is a military rank. In Poland, the title is "Marszałek Polski," and Piłsudski was the first to hold that rank.

The user said "First Marshall," which could be a variant spelling, but in English, it's often "Marshal."

Given that, I'm confident it's Józef Piłsudski.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. Since the question is straightforward, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Final answer: Józef Piłsudski

I should spell it correctly. It's Józef Piłsudski, with the diacritics, but in plain text, it might be written as Jozef Pilsudski, but I'll use the proper spelling.

In the boxed answer, I'll use the standard English representation.
