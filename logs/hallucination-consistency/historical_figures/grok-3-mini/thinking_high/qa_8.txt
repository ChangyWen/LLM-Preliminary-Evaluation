*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1840, died in 1926, and is known for being a "French impressionist painter (1840-1926)".

I need to recall who this might be. The description matches Claude Monet. Let me confirm his details.

Claude Monet was a French painter and a key figure in the Impressionist movement. He was born on November 14, 1840, and died on December 5, 1926. That matches the birth and death years given.

Are there any other famous French impressionist painters born in 1840 and died in 1926? Let me think.

Pierre-Auguste Renoir was an impressionist painter, but he was born in 1841 and died in 1919, so that doesn't match.

Edgar Degas was born in 1834 and died in 1917, not matching.

Camille Pissarro was born in 1830 and died in 1903, no.

Berthe Morisot was born in 1841 and died in 1895, close but not exact.

Alfred Sisley was born in 1839 and died in 1899, not matching.

So, Claude Monet seems to be the only one who fits the exact birth and death years.

The description specifically says "French impressionist painter (1840-1926)", which is a common way to refer to Monet in biographical notes or encyclopedias.

Therefore, the answer should be Claude Monet.

The question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct, but since it's an AI, I can add a bit of reasoning if needed, but the final answer should be isolated.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
