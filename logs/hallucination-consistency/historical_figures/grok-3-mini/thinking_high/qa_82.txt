First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1642, died in 1727, and known as a 'British physicist and mathematician'.

I need to recall who fits this description. The years 1642 and 1727 ring a bell. I think Isaac Newton was born in 1642 and died in 1727. Let me confirm that.

Yes, Isaac Newton is famously known for his work in physics and mathematics. He's British, born in Woolsthorpe, England, and he lived from 1642 to 1727.

Now, the question specifies 'British physicist and mathematician'. Newton is often called that. He formulated the laws of motion, universal gravitation, and contributed to calculus, which is mathematics.

Are there any other figures who might fit this? Let's think. Someone born in 1642 and died in 1727. Newton is the most prominent one. Others like Leibniz were mathematicians, but Leibniz was German, born in 1646, and died in 1716, so that doesn't match.

Robert Hooke was a contemporary, but he was born in 1635 and died in 1703, so not matching the dates.

Edmund Halley was an astronomer, born in 1656, died in 1742, not matching.

So, Isaac Newton seems to be the clear match.

The question says to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can briefly confirm the details, but since the question asks for the name, I don't need to elaborate too much.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
