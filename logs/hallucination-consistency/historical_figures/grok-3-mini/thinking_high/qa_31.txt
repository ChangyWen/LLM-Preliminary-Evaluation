*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1821, died in 1867, and described as a "French poet, essayist and art critic (1821-1867)".

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds familiar. I think it's Charles Baudelaire. Let me confirm the dates.

Charles Baudelaire was a French poet, famous for his work "Les Fleurs du Mal". He was indeed born in 1821 and died in 1867. Yes, that matches.

Just to be sure, let's think if there's anyone else who fits this description. The dates are specific: 1821-1867. Baudelaire is well-known for being a poet, essayist, and art critic. He wrote about art and was influential in that area.

Other French figures from that era: Victor Hugo was born in 1802 and died in 1885, so not matching. Gustave Flaubert was born in 1821 but died in 1880, and he's more known as a novelist, not primarily a poet or art critic. Baudelaire fits perfectly.

The description in parentheses "(1821-1867)" is exactly matching the birth and death years given in the question.

So, I'm confident that the answer is Charles Baudelaire.

Now, the question says to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should write my response and then on a new line, just the name.

Response structure: I can have a brief reasoning, but since it's straightforward, I might not need much. But to make it clear, I'll just state the answer as instructed.
