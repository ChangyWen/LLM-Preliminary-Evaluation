First, the question asks for a historical figure born in 1854, died in 1891, described as a "19th century French poet who influenced modern literature and arts, and prefigured surrealism."

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds familiar. Let me think about famous French poets from the 19th century.

One name that comes to mind is Arthur Rimbaud. I think he was a French poet, and he fits the timeline. Let me check the dates: Born in 1854, died in 1891. Yes, that matches Arthur Rimbaud.

Now, confirm the description: He is known for influencing modern literature and arts, and he prefigured surrealism. Rimbaud is often credited with that. He wrote "A Season in Hell" and other works that were innovative and influenced later movements like surrealism.

Are there any other poets who might fit this? Paul Verlaine was a contemporary, but he was born in 1844 and died in 1896, so the birth year doesn't match. Verlaine lived longer too.

Charles Baudelaire was born in 1821 and died in 1867, so that's way off.

Stéphane Mallarmé was born in 1842 and died in 1898, not matching the birth year.

So, Arthur Rimbaud seems to be the correct one.

Just to be thorough, let's ensure the death year: Rimbaud died in 1891, yes. And he was born on October 20, 1854.

His influence: He abandoned poetry young and had a adventurous life, but his works are seminal in modern poetry.

The question says "prefigured surrealism." Rimbaud's use of automatic writing and dream-like imagery is often seen as a precursor to surrealism, which was founded by André Breton in the 20th century.

Everything checks out.

Now, the response should end with the name in a new line. So, I'll write a brief confirmation and then put the answer.

Final answer: Arthur Rimbaud
