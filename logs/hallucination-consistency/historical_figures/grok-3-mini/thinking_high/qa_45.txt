First, the question asks for a historical figure with specific details: born in 1899, died in 1943, and known for being a French resistance fighter and civil servant.

I need to recall who this might be. The name that comes to mind is Jean Moulin. Let me verify the details.

Jean Moulin was a key figure in the French Resistance during World War II. He was involved in unifying the resistance groups under the leadership of Charles de Gaulle.

Now, check the birth and death years. Jean Moulin was born in 1899 and died in 1943. Yes, that's correct. He was born on June 20, 1899, and died on July 8, 1943, after being captured and tortured by the Gestapo.

He was also a civil servant before the war. He worked in various administrative roles in the French government, including as a prefect.

So, he fits all the criteria: born in 1899, died in 1943, French resistance fighter, and civil servant.

I should consider if there's anyone else who might fit this description. I'm not aware of any other prominent figure with exactly these details. Jean Moulin is one of the most famous French resistance fighters, often symbolized by his image on the euro coin.

The question specifies "the historical figure," implying there's a well-known one that matches, so Jean Moulin seems to be the answer.

Finally, the response should end with the name on a new line. So, I'll structure my answer accordingly.
