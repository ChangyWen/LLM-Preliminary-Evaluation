*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1868, died in 1950, and is known as a "Chilean politician and President."

I need to recall who that might be. I'm thinking about Chilean presidents. One that comes to mind is Arturo Alessandri Palma. Let me check his birth and death years.

Arturo Alessandri was a president of Chile. I think he was born in 1868 and died in 1950. That sounds familiar.

Confirming the years: Born in 1868, died in 1950. Yes, that matches.

He is indeed known as a Chilean politician and served as President of Chile. He was president twice, I believe, in the 1920s and 1930s.

Are there any other Chilean presidents born in 1868? I don't think so. Let me think about other famous Chilean figures.

For example, there's Augusto Pinochet, but he was born much later, in 1915. Or Salvador Allende, born in 1908. Neither matches.

What about Pedro Aguirre Cerda? He was president, but born in 1879, died in 1941. Not matching.

Or Juan Antonio RÃ­os, born in 1888, died in 1946. No.

So, Arturo Alessandri seems to be the one.

Just to be thorough, let me make sure of his full name. It's Arturo Alessandri Palma.

The question says "known for 'Chilean politician and President'", which fits him perfectly.

Now, the response should end with the name on a new line.

So, my final answer should be: Arturo Alessandri

I think it's commonly referred to as Arturo Alessandri, but sometimes with the last name Palma. However, in historical contexts, he's often called Arturo Alessandri.

To be precise, I should use the full name if possible, but the question doesn't specify, so "Arturo Alessandri" should be fine.

Confirming the years again: Born 1868, died 1950. Yes.

I think that's correct.
