*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1790, died in 1832, and is known as a 'French classical scholar'. I need to recall who that might be.

I'm thinking about famous French scholars from that era. The time period is early 19th century. Classical scholar probably means someone who studied ancient Greek and Roman literature, history, etc.

One name that comes to mind is François-René de Chateaubriand. He was a French writer and diplomat, born in 1768 and died in 1848. That doesn't match the dates: born 1790, died 1832.

Another one: Victor Hugo? He was born in 1802 and died in 1885, so not that.

Perhaps it's someone less famous. Let me think about classical scholars. I recall Auguste Comte, but he was a philosopher of science, born in 1798, died in 1857. Close but not exact, and he's not primarily known as a classical scholar.

The description is 'French classical scholar'. Maybe it's someone like Jean-François Champollion. He was the decipherer of Egyptian hieroglyphs, which is related to classics in a way. Born in 1790, died in 1832. Let me confirm that.

Yes, Jean-François Champollion was born on December 23, 1790, and died on October 4, 1832. He is French and is often associated with Egyptology, which is a branch of classical studies since it deals with ancient civilizations. But is he specifically called a 'classical scholar'? Classical scholarship typically refers to Greek and Roman antiquity, while Champollion is more Egyptology. But perhaps it's broad enough.

The question says 'French classical scholar', and Champollion fits the dates perfectly. Let me see if there's anyone else.

Another possibility: Perhaps it's someone like Barthold Georg Niebuhr, but he was German, not French.

Or maybe François Guizot, but he was a historian, born in 1787, died in 1874. Not matching.

Let me double-check Champollion. He is indeed born in 1790 and died in 1832. And he is French. Now, is he known as a classical scholar? He studied ancient languages, including Coptic and Egyptian, which are related to classical studies.

Perhaps it's someone else. Let me think about Pierre-Simon Laplace, but he was a mathematician and astronomer, born 1749, died 1827. No.

Or maybe Augustin-Louis Cauchy, mathematician, born 1789, died 1857. Close birth year but not exact, and not a classical scholar.

1790 is specific. Champollion seems to fit.

I think Champollion is the one. Let me confirm the death year: yes, 1832.

The question specifies 'known for 'French classical scholar'', so probably Champollion is intended, even if Egyptology is a subset.

Perhaps it's someone like Antoine-Jean Gros, but he was a painter, not a scholar.

I think Champollion is the best match.

So, my final answer should be Jean-François Champollion.

The question says to put the final answer in a new line at the end.
