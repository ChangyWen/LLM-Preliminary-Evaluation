First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1952, died in 2001, and is known as an 'English writer and humorist'. I need to identify who that is.

I am considering famous English writers and humorists. The birth year is 1952 and death in 2001, so the person lived to be 49 years old (2001 - 1952 = 49).

Who fits this description? Douglas Adams comes to mind. He's known for "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", which is humorous. Was he English? Yes, he was born in England.

Confirming the dates: Douglas Adams was born on March 11, 1952, and he died on May 11, 2001. That matches the years given.

Is he primarily known as a writer and humorist? Absolutely, his work is famous for its satirical and humorous take on science fiction.

Are there any other figures that might fit? Let me think. Terry Pratchett was a humorist writer, but he was born in 1948 and died in 2015, so that doesn't match. P.G. Wodehouse was earlier, born in 1881. No one else seems to fit the exact birth and death years.

The description says "English writer and humorist". Douglas Adams is English, a writer, and definitely a humorist.

So, I think Douglas Adams is the answer.

The question says to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I'll write my response and then on a new line, state the name.

Final answer: Douglas Adams
