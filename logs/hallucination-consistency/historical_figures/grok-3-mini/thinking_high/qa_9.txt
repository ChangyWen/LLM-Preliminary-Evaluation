First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1599, died in 1660, and is known as a "Spanish painter (1599-1660)". So, I need to recall who that painter is.

I know that Diego Velázquez is a famous Spanish painter. Let me check his birth and death years. I think he was born in 1599 and died in 1660. Yes, that matches the dates given.

To confirm, Velázquez is indeed Spanish and one of the most renowned painters of the Spanish Golden Age. He's famous for works like "Las Meninas" and portraits of the Spanish royal family.

Are there any other painters who fit this description? Let me think. The dates are specific: born 1599, died 1660. I don't recall any other major painter with those exact dates. For example, Rembrandt was Dutch and lived from 1606 to 1669, so that doesn't match. Caravaggio was Italian and died in 1610, way earlier. So, Velázquez seems to be the correct one.

The question specifies "known for 'Spanish painter (1599-1660)'", which is essentially describing Velázquez. It's like a clue from a database or encyclopedia entry.

My final answer should be the name of this figure, and I need to put it in a new line at the end of my response.

So, the answer is Diego Velázquez.

I should make sure about the spelling. It's commonly written as Diego Velázquez in English contexts, but in Spanish, it's Diego Velázquez. I think for this purpose, "Diego Velázquez" is fine.

Now, structuring my response: The user said to reason step by step, which I've done, and then give the final answer in a new line.

So, I'll end with:

Diego Velázquez

On a new line.
