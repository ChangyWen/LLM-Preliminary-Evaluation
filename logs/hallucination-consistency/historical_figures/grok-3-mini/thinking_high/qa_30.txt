*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1700, died in 1755, and described as a "German-born French soldier and statesman (1700-1755)."

I need to recall who this might be. The description matches someone I think is Maurice de Saxe. Let me confirm the details.

Maurice de Saxe was a military leader. He was born in 1696, not 1700. That doesn't match. The question says born in 1700, so it might not be him.

Perhaps it's someone else. Let me think of other figures. The description says "German-born French soldier and statesman." Maurice de Saxe was indeed German-born (from Saxony) and served in the French army, but his birth year is 1696, not 1700.

Maybe I'm mistaken. Let me double-check the birth year. Upon thinking, Maurice de Saxe was born in 1696 and died in 1750, not 1755. That's not matching at all.

Perhaps it's Frederick the Great? But he was born in 1712 and died in 1786, and he was Prussian, not French.

The description specifies "French soldier and statesman," so it has to be someone associated with France.

Let me think of other possibilities. What about Voltaire? But he was a writer, not a soldier, and born in 1694.

Perhaps it's Hermann Maurice de Saxe, but no, same person.

Maybe it's a typo or something, but I need to find someone who fits born 1700, died 1755.

Let me recall: is there a figure named something like that?

Perhaps it's Maurice, Count de Saxe, but again, birth year is wrong.

Maybe it's someone else. Let's think about the dates: 1700-1755.

I think there might be a confusion. Perhaps it's not Maurice de Saxe.

Another thought: could it be Frederick II of Prussia? No, wrong dates.

Perhaps it's Charles XII of Sweden, but he died in 1718.

Let's search my memory for someone born in 1700.

I recall that Johann Sebastian Bach was born in 1685, not 1700.

Perhaps it's George II of Great Britain, born 1683.

This is tricky. Maybe it's a less famous figure.

Perhaps it's the same Maurice de Saxe, and the dates are approximate or I'm misremembering.

Upon second thought, I think Maurice de Saxe was born in 1696 and died in 1750. But the question says 1700-1755, so it might be a different person.

Maybe it's a typo in the question, or perhaps it's referring to someone else.

Another idea: is there a figure named something like de Saxe or similar.

Perhaps it's Hermann von Wartensleben or someone, but I'm not sure.

Let's think logically. The description is given as "German-born French soldier and statesman (1700-1755)", so probably it's a standard reference.

Upon thinking, I believe it is Maurice de Saxe, and perhaps the birth year is often rounded or something, but 1696 is close to 1700, and death is 1750, not 1755.

Death in 1750, question says 1755. That's a five-year difference.

Perhaps it's Voltaire, but he died in 1778.

Another thought: could it be the Maréchal de Saxe? Same thing.

Perhaps it's Frederick the Great's father, Frederick William I, born 1688, died 1740.

Not matching.

Let's try to recall: is there a famous French statesman born in 1700.

Perhaps it's Cardinal Fleury, but he was born in 1653 and died in 1743.

Not matching.

Maybe it's someone like the Duke of Richelieu, Louis François Armand de Vignerot du Plessis, but he was born in 1696 and died in 1788.

Still not.

Perhaps it's a mistake, and it's Maurice de Saxe with approximate dates.

But the question specifies the dates, so I need to find someone who fits.

Another idea: could it be Hermann Maurice Saxe? No.

Let's think about the name. The description says "German-born French soldier and statesman", and the dates are given.

Upon searching my memory, I think it might be a reference to Maurice, Comte de Saxe, and perhaps in some sources, dates are wrong, but I doubt it.

Perhaps it's George Washington, but he was born in 1732.

No.

Let's consider if there's a figure I don't remember.

Perhaps it's the same person, and I should go with Maurice de Saxe.

But the dates don't match. Born 1696, not 1700, died 1750, not 1755.

Difference of 4 years in birth and 5 in death.

Maybe it's a different person. Let's think about French history.

Another thought: is it the Comte de Saint-Germain? But he was a mysterious figure, birth date unknown, died 1784 or something.

Not matching.

Perhaps it's Frederick of Prussia, but no.

Let's try to recall: in 1755, who died? For example, Samuel Johnson was alive, etc.

Perhaps it's Benjamin Franklin, but born 1706, died 1790.

Close birth year, but not French.

The key is "German-born French".

So, someone who was German and became French.

Maurice de Saxe was from Saxony, which is German, and served France.

Perhaps the dates are incorrect in my memory.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, I think Maurice de Saxe was born on 28 October 1696 and died on 30 November 1750. So not 1700 or 1755.

Maybe it's a different figure. Let's think about other German-born French figures.

Another one: perhaps it's the Marquis de Montcalm, but he was born in 1712 and died in 1759, and he was French, not German-born.

Not that.

Perhaps it's a statesman like that.

I recall that there is a figure named Hermann Maurice de Saxe, but it's the same.

Perhaps the question has a typo, and it's 1696-1750, but it says 1700-1755.

Maybe it's Voltaire, but he was not a soldier.

Let's read the description again: "German-born French soldier and statesman (1700-1755)".

Perhaps it's not Maurice de Saxe. Let's think of someone else.

Another possibility: is it Frederick the Great? But he was not French.

No.

Perhaps it's Charles de Rohan, Prince de Soubise, but he was born in 1715 and died in 1787.

Not matching.

Maybe it's the Duke of Cumberland, but he was British.

I'm stuck.

Let's try to search for historical figures born in 1700.

I recall that Jonathan Swift was born in 1667, Daniel Defoe 1660, etc.

In 1700, who was born? William Blackstone was born in 1723.

Perhaps it's a less known figure.

Maybe it's the same Maurice de Saxe, and I should go with that.

Perhaps the figure is Hermann, but I think it's Maurice.

Another thought: Maurice de Saxe is often called Marshal Saxe, and he is indeed the one.

Perhaps in some contexts, his birth year is listed as 1700, but I doubt it.

Let's assume that the description is correct, and the figure is Maurice de Saxe, as he is the most famous German-born French soldier.

And perhaps the dates are approximate for the purpose of this question.

Maybe it's a different person, but I can't think of anyone else.

One more idea: is it the Elector of Saxony? Frederick Augustus II was born in 1696, died 1763, and he was King of Poland, not particularly a French soldier.

Not that.

Perhaps it's a minor figure, but the question implies it's well-known.

I think I have to go with Maurice de Saxe.

So, I'll say the name is Maurice de Saxe.

And the question asks for the name, and to put it in a new line at the end.

So, my final answer is Maurice de Saxe.

But to be precise, let's confirm the dates. Upon second thought, perhaps the figure is different.

Let's think about 1755. Who died in 1755? For example, Samuel Johnson was alive, Edward Braddock died in 1755, but he was British, not German-born French.

Not that.

Perhaps it's a French figure. The Lisbon earthquake was in 1755, but not a person.

I think I have to stick with Maurice de Saxe, even though the dates don't match perfectly.

Perhaps it's a typo, and it's 1696-1750, but the question says 1700-1755.

Another possibility: is it Voltaire? Born 1694, died 1778, not matching, and not soldier.

No.

Perhaps it's Frederick II, born 1712, died 1786.

No.

I think I should answer Maurice de Saxe.

So, I'll go with that.
