*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1452, died in 1519, and described as an 'Italian Renaissance polymath (1452-1519)'.

I need to recall who this refers to. The years 1452-1519 are very specific. I know that Leonardo da Vinci was born in 1452 and died in 1519. He is famously known as a Renaissance polymath, meaning he was skilled in many areas like painting, sculpture, science, engineering, and more.

Confirming the description: 'Italian Renaissance polymath (1452-1519)' â€“ that matches Leonardo da Vinci perfectly. He was Italian, born in Vinci, Tuscany, and his contributions span the Renaissance period.

Are there any other figures who might fit this description? Let me think. Michelangelo was born in 1475 and died in 1564, so that doesn't match. Raphael was born in 1483 and died in 1520, also not matching. Galileo was much later, born in 1564. So, Leonardo da Vinci is the clear match.

The user asks for the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly. I can provide a brief explanation and then put the answer on a new line.

Response structure:
- Start with a confirmation or brief explanation.
- End with the answer on a new line.

Final answer should be just the name: Leonardo da Vinci.

Make sure the answer is accurate. Yes, Leonardo da Vinci is the one.
