First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1606, died in 1684, and is known as a 'French tragedian'. I need to recall who that might be.

I know that a tragedian is someone who writes tragedies, like plays. And it's specified as French, so it's probably a French playwright.

The birth year is 1606 and death year is 1684. That lifespan sounds familiar. I think of Jean Racine. Let me confirm his dates.

Jean Racine was a famous French playwright, known for his tragedies. I believe he was born in 1639, but that doesn't match. 1639 is later than 1606. So that can't be right.

1606 to 1684. Who else? Maybe Pierre Corneille? I think Corneille was born in 1606. Let me think.

Pierre Corneille was a French dramatist, known for tragedies like "Le Cid". I recall he was born in 1606 and died in 1684. Yes, that sounds right.

Let me double-check. Born in 1606, died in 1684. And he's often called a French tragedian because of his works in tragedy.

What about Molière? Molière was a comedian, not primarily a tragedian, and his dates are different. Molière was born in 1622 and died in 1673, so that doesn't match.

Racine was born in 1639 and died in 1699, so that's not it.

So, Pierre Corneille fits the bill. He is indeed known as a French tragedian.

Just to be thorough, is there anyone else who might fit this description? I don't think so. Corneille is one of the big three in French classical drama: Corneille, Racine, and Molière, but Molière is more comedy.

The question specifies 'French tragedian', and Corneille's works include tragedies.

Final answer should be Pierre Corneille.

The question says to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So I'll write it accordingly.
