*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1888, died in 1976, and is known as a 'French writer'. I need to recall who that might be.

I know several famous French writers. Let me think about their birth and death years.

One that comes to mind is Marcel Proust. I think he was born in 1871 and died in 1922. That doesn't match 1888-1976.

Another is André Gide. He was born in 1869 and died in 1951. Not matching.

What about Jean-Paul Sartre? He was born in 1905 and died in 1980. Too late for 1888.

Albert Camus was born in 1913 and died in 1960. Not it.

Maybe it's someone else. Let me think of writers born around 1888.

Colette comes to mind. She was a French writer. I think she was born in 1873 and died in 1954. Not matching.

Perhaps it's André Breton. He was a French writer, part of the Surrealist movement. Born in 1896, died in 1966. Close but not 1888.

1888 is specific. Let me think of famous figures born in 1888.

I recall that T.S. Eliot was born in 1888, but he's American-British, not French.

The question specifies 'French writer', so it has to be French.

Another one: Paul Valéry. He was a French poet and philosopher. Born in 1871, died in 1945. No.

What about Marcel Pagnol? He was a French writer and filmmaker. Born in 1895, died in 1974. Close to 1976 but birth year is off.

Died in 1976. Who died in 1976?

André Malraux comes to mind. He was a French writer, adventurer, and politician. Let me check his birth and death years.

I think André Malraux was born in 1901 and died in 1976. Wait, born in 1901? That doesn't match 1888.

Perhaps I'm confusing him.

Let's think differently. Maybe it's someone like Louis-Ferdinand Céline. He was a French writer, born in 1894, died in 1961. Not matching.

What about Georges Simenon? He was a Belgian writer, but wrote in French. Born in 1903, died in 1989. Not it.

Born in 1888. Let me try to recall writers from that era.

Oh, wait a minute, I think it might be Henri Barbusse. He was a French novelist and journalist. Born in 1873, died in 1935. No.

Perhaps it's Blaise Cendrars. He was a Swiss-born French writer. Born in 1887, died in 1961. Close to 1888 but not exact, and death year is wrong.

1887 is very close to 1888. Maybe it's a rounding or something, but the question says 1888.

Another one: Paul Claudel. French poet and dramatist. Born in 1868, died in 1955. No.

Let's think about women writers. Colette was 1873-1954.

What about Marguerite Yourcenar? She was a French writer, but born in 1903, died in 1987. Not it.

Perhaps it's Jean Cocteau. He was a French writer, artist, etc. Born in 1889, died in 1963. Birth year is 1889, very close to 1888, but not exact. Death year is 1963, not 1976.

The question says born in 1888, died in 1976. So I need exact match.

Let me try to search my memory for someone born in 1888.

I recall that André Gorz was a French writer, but he was born in 1923, died in 2007. No.

Perhaps it's not a very famous figure, but the question says "historical figure" and "known for 'French writer'", so it should be prominent.

Another thought: Marcel Aymé. French writer. Born in 1902, died in 1967. No.

Let's think about the death year 1976. Who died in 1976 that was a French writer?

I know Agatha Christie died in 1976, but she's British, not French.

André Malraux died in 1976, but he was born in 1901.

Perhaps it's someone else.

What about Louis Aragon? He was a French poet and novelist. Born in 1897, died in 1982. Not matching.

Born in 1888... let me think of famous people born in 1888.

I know that T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) was born in 1888, but he's not a French writer.

Edith Wharton was born in 1862, American.

Perhaps it's not a writer I'm thinking of.

Let's consider if the 'French writer' part is key. Maybe it's a well-known figure.

Oh, wait a minute, I think it might be Fernand Léger or someone, but he's a painter, not primarily a writer.

Another idea: Jean Giraudoux. French dramatist. Born in 1882, died in 1944. Close but not exact.

1882 is close to 1888.

Perhaps it's Paul Morand. French diplomat and writer. Born in 1888, died in 1976. Let me check that.

I think Paul Morand was born on March 13, 1888, and died on July 24, 1976. Yes, that matches!

He was a French writer, known for his novels and short stories, and he was also a diplomat.

Confirming: born 1888, died 1976, French writer. That seems perfect.

Is he well-known? He's a historical figure, and the description fits.

I think Paul Morand is the answer.

But let me make sure there isn't someone more famous.

Another possibility: Is it Georges Bernanos? He was a French writer, born in 1888, died in 1948. Death year is 1948, not 1976.

Born in 1888, but died in 1948.

Paul Morand: yes, 1888-1976.

Perhaps it's someone like Julien Green, but he was American-born but wrote in French, born in 1900.

No, Paul Morand seems to fit.

I think that's it.
