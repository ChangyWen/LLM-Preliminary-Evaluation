*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1896, died in 1986, and known as a Chilean politician and President. The description in quotes is 'Chilean politician and President (1896-1986)', which matches the birth and death years.

I need to recall who this might be. I'm thinking of famous Chilean presidents. One that comes to mind is Augusto Pinochet, but he was born in 1915 and died in 2006, so that doesn't match.

Another one is Salvador Allende. I think he was born in 1908 and died in 1973, which doesn't match the 1896-1986 lifespan.

Let me think about presidents from that era. The years 1896-1986 span a long time, so it could be someone who lived through that period.

Perhaps it's Arturo Alessandri. I recall he was a Chilean president. Let me check the years: I think he was born in 1868 and died in 1950, which doesn't match.

Maybe it's someone else. Let's think systematically. The description says "President (1896-1986)", which might imply the lifespan, not the term of presidency.

I remember Gabriel González Videla. He was president from 1946 to 1952. Born in 1898, died in 1980 – close but not exact; born 1898, not 1896, and died 1980, not 1986.

What about Carlos Ibáñez del Campo? He was a Chilean president. I think he was born in 1877 and died in 1960, not matching.

Perhaps it's Eduardo Frei Montalva. He was president from 1964 to 1970. Born in 1911, died in 1982 – still not 1896-1986.

1896 birth year. Who was born in 1896 in Chile and became president?

I think it might be Arturo Alessandri Palma, but earlier I thought he was born in 1868. No, there was Arturo Alessandri, but let's confirm.

Upon second thought, I believe the person is Arturo Alessandri Palma. Wait, no, I think he was born in 1868.

Perhaps it's someone else. Let's think about Jorge Alessandri. He was president from 1958 to 1964. Born in 1896, I think, and died in 1986. Yes! That sounds familiar.

Let me verify: Jorge Alessandri Rodríguez was a Chilean political figure and President. He was born on May 19, 1896, and died on August 31, 1986. And he served as President from 1958 to 1964.

Yes, that matches perfectly: born 1896, died 1986, Chilean politician and President.

The description says "Chilean politician and President (1896-1986)", which likely refers to his lifespan.

So, the historical figure is Jorge Alessandri.

Just to be thorough, is there anyone else who fits this description? I don't think so. Salvador Allende was born later, Pinochet was born later, etc.

So, I'm confident with Jorge Alessandri.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

Response structure: I can briefly confirm or just state the answer, but since it's a direct question, I might not need much fluff. But to make it clear, I can say something like: "Based on the details provided, the historical figure is Jorge Alessandri."

Then, on a new line, put the name.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I'll end with the answer on a new line.
