*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in -470, died in -399, and known as an 'ancient Greek philosopher'.

I need to interpret the years. The negative signs probably indicate BC years, so born in 470 BC and died in 399 BC. That's a common way to denote BC dates in some systems.

Now, thinking about ancient Greek philosophers. The most famous one born around 470 BC and died around 399 BC is Socrates. Let me confirm his dates.

From my knowledge, Socrates was born in 470 BC and died in 399 BC. Yes, that matches perfectly.

He is indeed known as an ancient Greek philosopher, often considered the father of Western philosophy.

Are there any other philosophers with similar dates? Let's think:

- Plato was born around 427 BC and died in 347 BC, so that's later.

- Aristotle was born in 384 BC and died in 322 BC, even later.

- Before Socrates, there were pre-Socratic philosophers like Heraclitus (born around 535 BC, died around 475 BC), but that doesn't match the dates.

- Pythagoras was born around 570 BC and died around 495 BC, not matching.

So, Socrates is the clear match.

The user specified 'ancient Greek philosopher' in quotes, which might be from a database or a specific source, but it's straightforward.

Finally, the user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can briefly confirm the details, but since the instruction is to give the final answer in a new line, I'll keep it concise.

Final answer: Socrates
