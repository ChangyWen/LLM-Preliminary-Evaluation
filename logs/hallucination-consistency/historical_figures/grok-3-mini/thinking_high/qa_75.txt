*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1883, died in 1924, and is known as a 'Bohemian novelist and short story writer'. I need to identify who that is.

Bohemian likely refers to Bohemia, a historical region in Central Europe, now part of the Czech Republic. So, this person is probably from that area or associated with it.

The years are 1883 to 1924. I need to think of famous writers from that time and place.

Franz Kafka comes to mind. He was a writer, and I think he was born in 1883 and died in 1924. Let me confirm that.

Yes, Franz Kafka was born on July 3, 1883, in Prague, which was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the time, and Prague is in Bohemia. He died on June 3, 1924.

Kafka is famous for his novels and short stories, like "The Metamorphosis", "The Trial", and "The Castle". He's often associated with existentialism and absurdism.

The description says 'Bohemian novelist and short story writer'. Kafka fits this perfectly as he was born in Bohemia and wrote both novels and short stories.

Are there any other writers who match this description? Let me think.

Another famous writer from that era is James Joyce, but he was Irish, born in 1882, died in 1941, so not matching.

Or Virginia Woolf, born 1882, died 1941, British.

What about other Czech writers? There's Karel ÄŒapek, but he was born in 1890 and died in 1938, so not matching the birth and death years.

Franz Kafka seems to be the one. He is indeed considered a Bohemian writer since he was from Prague, which was in Bohemia.

The question specifies 'Bohemian', and Kafka is often referred to in that context.

Now, the question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should lead to that, and then state the name.

Final answer should be: Franz Kafka

Make sure the format is correct. It says "in a new line at the end", so probably just write the name on a new line.

Also, ensure that I'm confident. Is there any chance it's someone else?

Just to double-check: Born 1883, died 1924. Kafka: yes.

Known for novels and short stories: yes.

Bohemian: yes, as he was from Prague, Bohemia.

I think that's it.
