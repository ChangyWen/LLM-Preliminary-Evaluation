First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1896, died in 1940, and known as 'Italian Marshal of the Air Force and minister (1896-1940)'.

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds familiar. I think it's referring to Italo Balbo. Let me confirm the details.

Italo Balbo was an Italian military officer and aviator. He was involved in the Italian Air Force and held high positions during the Fascist era under Mussolini.

Birth and death years: Born in 1896 and died in 1940. Yes, that matches. He was born on June 6, 1896, and died on June 28, 1940.

His roles: He was a Marshal of the Air Force in Italy, and he served as a minister. Specifically, he was the Minister of Aviation in Italy from 1926 to 1929, and he was known for his transatlantic flights and was a key figure in the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force).

The description says 'Italian Marshal of the Air Force and minister (1896-1940)', which aligns perfectly with Italo Balbo.

I should make sure there isn't another figure who fits this description. Benito Mussolini was born in 1883 and died in 1945, so that doesn't match. Other Italian figures like Victor Emmanuel III don't fit the air force and minister part.

Balbo was famously killed in 1940 when his plane was shot down by friendly fire over Tobruk, which matches the death year.

So, I'm confident that the answer is Italo Balbo.

The question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.
