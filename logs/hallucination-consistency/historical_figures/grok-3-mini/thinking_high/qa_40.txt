*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1719, died in 1786, and known as a "French horticulturalist (1719-1786)". I need to recall who this might be.

I'm thinking about famous French horticulturalists from that era. Horticulture involves gardening and plant cultivation, so it could be someone involved in botany or plant breeding.

The years given are 1719-1786. That spans the 18th century. I know that Carl Linnaeus was a botanist, but he was Swedish and lived from 1707-1778, so not him.

Perhaps it's André Le Nôtre, but he was a landscape architect who designed the gardens at Versailles and lived from 1613-1700, which doesn't match the dates.

Maybe it's someone like Joseph Dombey or someone else. I think there's a famous French botanist named Bernard de Jussieu or Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu. Let me check their dates.

Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu was a French botanist who lived from 1748-1836, which is not 1719-1786.

1719-1786... who was born in 1719? I recall that Jean-Jacques Rousseau was born in 1712 and died in 1778, close but not exact, and he wasn't primarily a horticulturalist.

Perhaps it's Philippe de Commerson or someone. No, that doesn't ring a bell.

I think it might be André Michaux. Let me think: André Michaux was a French botanist and explorer, known for his work in North America. What were his dates? I believe he was born in 1746 and died in 1802, which doesn't match.

Maybe it's Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, but he was a philosopher and lived from 1657-1757, not matching.

Perhaps it's someone less famous. The description says "French horticulturalist (1719-1786)", so it might be a specific person commonly referred to that way.

I think it could be Antoine Duhamel or something. No.

Suddenly I recall: I think it's André Thouin. No, let's think.

Upon second thought, I believe the person is Bernard de Jussieu, but earlier I thought his dates were wrong. Let me double-check.

Actually, Bernard de Jussieu lived from 1699-1777, close but not exact. 1719 is later.

Perhaps it's his brother or relative. Antoine de Jussieu lived from 1686-1758, still not.

Maybe it's not Jussieu. Let me think of other names.

I remember now: I think it's André Le Nôtre, but dates don't match.

Perhaps it's Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, but he lived from 1744-1829.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to recall from history.

Another thought: perhaps it's the person who is often cited in horticulture. I think it might be Philip Miller, but he was English.

The question specifies French.

Let me search my memory: born 1719, died 1786. Who is that?

I think it could be Denis Diderot, but he was a philosopher, born 1713, died 1784, close but not exact, and not a horticulturalist.

1786 death year. Who died in 1786? Mozart died in 1791, Washington was alive.

Perhaps it's Benjamin Franklin, but he was American, born 1706, died 1790, and not French.

The question says French horticulturalist.

Let me think of French botanists. I recall Antoine Nicolas Duchesne. What were his dates? I think he was born in 1747 and died in 1827, not matching.

Perhaps it's someone like Buffon. Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, was a naturalist, born 1707, died 1788, close to 1719-1786, but 1707 is not 1719, and he was more of a naturalist than specifically a horticulturalist.

1719 is specific. Who was born in 1719?

I think it might be Jean Senebier, but he was a Swiss botanist, born 1742.

Perhaps it's Carl Peter Thunberg, but Swedish.

I'm struggling. Maybe I need to recall that the person is often listed with those dates.

Upon thinking, I believe the historical figure is André Michaux, but earlier I thought 1746-1802. No.

Let's confirm: I think André Michaux was born in 1746, not 1719.

Perhaps it's his father or someone.

Another name: I think it could be the Duc de Croÿ or someone, but not sure.

Perhaps it's Pierre Poivre, a French botanist, born 1719, died 1786. Let me check that.

Pierre Poivre was a French botanist and administrator in the French East India Company, known for introducing spices to Mauritius and other places. Born in 1719, died in 1786. Yes, that sounds right.

Confirming: Pierre Poivre, often called the "French horticulturalist," and his dates match: 1719-1786.

He is known for his work in botany and horticulture, introducing plants like cloves and nutmeg to new regions.

So, I think that's the answer.

The question says "known for 'French horticulturalist (1719-1786)'", which might be a direct quote or description, so Pierre Poivre fits.

To be thorough, is there anyone else? Another possibility is Bernard de Jussieu, but his dates are 1699-1777, not exact.

Or Antoine de Jussieu, 1686-1758.

No, Pierre Poivre seems correct.

So, my final answer is Pierre Poivre.
