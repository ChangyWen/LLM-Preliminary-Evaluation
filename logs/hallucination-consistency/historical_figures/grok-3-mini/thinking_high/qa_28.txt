*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1911, died in 1982, and is known for being the President of Chile. The description is 'President of Chile (1911-1982)', which likely means the person was president and lived from 1911 to 1982.

I need to recall who this might be. The years 1911-1982 are the birth and death years, not necessarily the presidency years. So, I'm looking for a Chilean president born in 1911 and died in 1982.

I know of Salvador Allende. He was a president of Chile. Let me check his birth and death years. I think Salvador Allende was born in 1908 and died in 1973. That doesn't match because he died in 1973, not 1982.

The description says 'President of Chile (1911-1982)', which might be confusing. Perhaps it's indicating the person's lifespan, not the presidency term. So, born 1911, died 1982.

Who was a president of Chile with those birth and death years?

Another famous Chilean president is Augusto Pinochet. I think he was born in 1915 and died in 2006. That doesn't match.

Born in 1911... Let me think. Perhaps it's Salvador Allende, but his birth year is 1908, not 1911. Maybe I'm mistaken.

Perhaps it's someone else. Let me recall other Chilean presidents.

Maybe it's Augusto Pinochet, but his birth year is 1915.

Perhaps the ' (1911-1982) ' is part of the description, but it might be a typo or misremembered.

Maybe it's referring to the lifespan.

Let's search my knowledge. Is there a Chilean president born in 1911?

I think Salvador Allende was born on June 26, 1908, and died on September 11, 1973. So that doesn't fit.

Perhaps it's Eduardo Frei Montalva. I think he was president from 1964 to 1970. What were his birth and death years?

I believe Eduardo Frei Montalva was born in 1911 and died in 1982. Yes, that sounds familiar.

Let me confirm: Born January 16, 1911, and died January 22, 1982. And he was President of Chile from 1964 to 1970.

That matches: born 1911, died 1982, and known as President of Chile.

The description says 'President of Chile (1911-1982)', which might be a bit ambiguous, but it likely means the person who was president and lived 1911-1982.

Yes, Eduardo Frei Montalva fits perfectly.

To make sure, is there anyone else? Pinochet was born later, Allende earlier.

So, I think it's Eduardo Frei Montalva.

Now, the question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should end with the name on a new line.
