First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1879, died in 1955, and described as "German-born theoretical physicist; developer of the theory of relativity (1879–1955)."

I need to recall who this refers to. The theory of relativity is famously associated with Albert Einstein. Let me confirm the birth and death years. Einstein was born in 1879 and died in 1955. Yes, that's correct.

The description matches: he was German-born, although he later moved to other countries, and he's indeed known as a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? I don't think so. The theory of relativity is uniquely attributed to Einstein. Other physicists like Lorentz or Poincaré contributed, but Einstein is credited with the special and general theories of relativity.

The years given in the description (1879–1955) directly match Einstein's lifespan.

So, the answer should be Albert Einstein.

The question says to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. Since the question is straightforward, I can just state the answer at the end.

Final answer: Albert Einstein

Make sure it's on a new line.
