*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1840, died in 1902, and is known as a 'French writer'. I need to recall who that might be.

I know several famous French writers. Let me think about their birth and death years.

One famous French writer is Émile Zola. I think he was born in 1840. Let me confirm that. Yes, Émile Zola was born on April 2, 1840, and he died in 1902. I recall he died in 1902 from carbon monoxide poisoning. That matches the dates.

Is he known as a French writer? Absolutely, he's one of the most prominent French writers, especially for his role in the naturalist movement and his involvement in the Dreyfus Affair.

Are there any other French writers born in 1840 and died in 1902? Let me think. Guy de Maupassant was a French writer, but he was born in 1850 and died in 1893, so that doesn't match.

Jules Verne was born in 1828 and died in 1905, so not him.

Victor Hugo was born in 1802 and died in 1885, too early.

Gustave Flaubert was born in 1821 and died in 1880, not matching.

So, Émile Zola seems to fit perfectly.

The question says "known for 'French writer'", which might be a bit vague, but it's probably just specifying that the person is a French writer. Zola is indeed French and a writer.

I think Zola is the correct answer.

Now, the question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should write my reasoning and then on a new line, just the name.

Final answer should be: Émile Zola

Make sure the spelling is correct. It's Émile Zola, with the accent on the E.

In the response, I need to box it or just put it on a new line. The instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", but in the user's message, it says "in a new line at the end of your response." Looking back: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

But in the initial system prompt, it might be to use \boxed{}, but the user specified "in a new line". To be safe, I'll follow the user's instruction.

So, I'll end with the answer on a new line.
