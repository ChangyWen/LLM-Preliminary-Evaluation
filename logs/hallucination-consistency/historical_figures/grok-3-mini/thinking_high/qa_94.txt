*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1868, died in 1947, and is known as a 'Slovenian biologist'. I need to recall or know who that might be.

I'm thinking about famous biologists. The description specifies "Slovenian biologist", so it should be someone from Slovenia or associated with it.

I remember Ivan Cankar, but he's a writer, not a biologist. Not him.

What about biologists? Gregor Mendel is famous, but he's Austrian, born in 1822, not Slovenian.

Perhaps it's someone less famous. Let me think about Slovenian history. Slovenia was part of Austria-Hungary back then, so the person might have been active in that context.

I think there's a biologist named Ivan Regent or something? No, that doesn't sound right.

Maybe it's related to genetics or evolution. Charles Darwin was born in 1809, died in 1882, not matching.

Born in 1868, died in 1947. That's a lifespan from 1868 to 1947. Who could that be?

I recall a figure named Jernej Kopitar, but he's a linguist, born earlier.

Perhaps it's Anton Strle or someone, but I'm not sure.

I think it might be Ivan Janez Vajgand or something. No.

Let's think systematically. Maybe I can recall famous Slovenian scientists.

I believe the person is likely Ivan Regent, but I'm not sure. Upon second thought, I think it's probably not him.

Another name comes to mind: perhaps it's related to the discoverer of something.

I think the most famous Slovenian biologist might be Gregor Mendel, but he's not Slovenian; he's from what is now Czech Republic.

Perhaps it's someone like Francè Prešeren, but he's a poet.

I need to search my memory. Oh, wait, I think it might be Ivan Cankar, but again, not biologist.

Perhaps it's a less known figure. But the question specifies "known for 'Slovenian biologist'", so it should be identifiable.

Maybe it's Janez Vajgand, but I'm not sure.

Upon thinking, I recall that there is a famous Slovenian biologist named Ivan Regen. Let me confirm the dates.

Ivan Regen was a Slovenian biologist, known for his work on animal behavior, particularly insects. I think he was born in 1868 and died in 1947. That sounds familiar.

Let me verify: born 1868, died 1947. Yes, I think that's correct. He was a pioneer in bioacoustics and studied how insects communicate.

So, probably, the answer is Ivan Regen.

But is his name spelled correctly? I think it's Ivan Regen, but in Slovenian, it might be Ivan Regen or something similar.

Upon double-checking my memory, I believe it's Ivan Regen.

Perhaps it's someone else, but I think that's the one.

So, I'll go with Ivan Regen.

Now, the question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should end with the name.
