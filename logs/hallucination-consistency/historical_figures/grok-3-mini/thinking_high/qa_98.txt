First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1683, died in 1764, and known as a 'French Baroque composer and music theorist'.

I need to recall who this might be. I'm thinking of famous composers from that era. The Baroque period is roughly from 1600 to 1750, so 1683 to 1764 fits within that timeframe.

The person is French, so I should think of French composers. One that comes to mind is Jean-Philippe Rameau. Let me verify his birth and death years.

I believe Rameau was born in 1683 and died in 1764. Yes, that matches.

He is indeed known as a French Baroque composer and music theorist. He wrote operas, harpsichord music, and his theoretical work on harmony is famous, like his "Treatise on Harmony."

Are there any other composers who fit this description? Let's think.

Bach was born in 1685 and died in 1750, so not matching. Handel was born in 1685 and died in 1759, also not matching, and he's German-British, not French.

Vivaldi was born in 1678 and died in 1741, doesn't match.

So, Rameau seems to be the correct one.

The question specifies 'French Baroque composer and music theorist', and Rameau fits perfectly.

Now, the response should end with the final answer on a new line.

So, I'll structure my response: I can have a brief reasoning, but since the instruction is to put the final answer at the end, I'll keep it concise.

Finally, the answer should be just the name, probably "Jean-Philippe Rameau".

Confirm the spelling: Jean-Philippe Rameau. Yes.

So, my final answer is Jean-Philippe Rameau.
