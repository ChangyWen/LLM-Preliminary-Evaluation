First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1882, died in 1942, and is known for being a Belarusian writer. The description is 'Belarusian writer (1882-1942)'.

I need to recall or know who this person is. I'm thinking about famous Belarusian writers. One name that comes to mind is Maksim Bahdanoviƒç. Let me check his birth and death years. I think he was born in 1891 and died in 1917, which doesn't match 1882-1942.

Another one is Yanka Kupala. I believe he was born in 1882 and died in 1942. Let me confirm that. Yes, Yanka Kupala was a prominent Belarusian poet and writer, and his lifespan matches: born in 1882, died in 1942.

Is there anyone else? Janka Kupala is the same as Yanka Kupala; it's just a transliteration. He's often referred to as Yanka Kupala.

Let me double-check the years. Yanka Kupala was born on July 7, 1882, and died on June 28, 1942. That matches perfectly.

The description says 'Belarusian writer (1882-1942)', which directly points to Yanka Kupala.

Just to be thorough, is there any other figure with the same birth and death years? I don't think so. Another famous Belarusian is perhaps Yakub Kolas, but he was born in 1882 and died in 1956, which doesn't match the death year of 1942.

Yakub Kolas: born 1882, died 1956. So, only the birth year matches, not the death year.

Therefore, Yanka Kupala is the correct one.

The question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should end with the name on a new line.

Final answer: Yanka Kupala

I should make sure about the spelling. It's commonly spelled as Yanka Kupala in English sources.

Sometimes it's written as Janka Kupala, but Yanka is more standard.

Yes, I'll go with that.
