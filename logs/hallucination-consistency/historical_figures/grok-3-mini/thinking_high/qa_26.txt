First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1921, died in 1981, and is known as a 'French singer-songwriter and poet'. I need to recall who that might be.

I know of several famous French figures, but let's narrow it down. The description matches someone like Serge Gainsbourg. Let me check his birth and death years.

Serge Gainsbourg was born in 1928, not 1921. That doesn't match. So, it's not him.

Who else is a French singer-songwriter and poet? Maybe Georges Brassens. I think he was born in 1921 and died in 1981. Let me confirm that.

Georges Brassens was indeed a French singer-songwriter and poet. He was known for his satirical and poetic songs. Born in 1921, died in 1981. That seems to fit perfectly.

Is there anyone else who might fit this description? Let's think about other French musicians. Jacques Brel was Belgian, not French, and he was born in 1929 and died in 1978, so that doesn't match.

Léo Ferré was a French singer-songwriter and poet. He was born in 1916 and died in 1993, so not 1921-1981.

Boris Vian was a French writer, poet, and musician, but he was born in 1920 and died in 1959, so not matching.

Charles Trenet was a French singer, born in 1913, died in 2001, not matching.

So, Georges Brassens seems to be the correct one. Born October 22, 1921, died October 29, 1981. Yes, that matches the years.

The question specifies 'French singer-songwriter and poet', and Brassens is famously known for that. He wrote and performed his own songs with poetic lyrics.

I think that's the answer.

Now, the question says to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should write my reasoning and then put the name on a new line.

Final answer: Georges Brassens
