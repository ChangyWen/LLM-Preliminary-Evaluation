*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure born in 1935, died in 1977, and known for being an "American singer and actor (1935–1977)". I need to identify who that is.

I am considering famous American singers and actors who lived during that period. The years 1935 to 1977 match the lifespan given.

One person that comes to mind is Elvis Presley. But Elvis was born in 1935 and died in 1977. Yes, that's correct. He was born on January 8, 1935, and died on August 16, 1977. He's famously known as an American singer and actor.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think. Another famous figure born in 1935 is Woody Allen, but he's a director and actor, not primarily a singer. And he's still alive, so he didn't die in 1977.

What about other singers? Johnny Cash was born in 1932, not 1935. Bob Dylan was born in 1941. So, Elvis seems to fit perfectly.

The description says "American singer and actor (1935–1977)", which directly matches Elvis Presley's biography. He's often referred to with those exact dates in parentheses.

Just to be thorough, let's confirm if there's any other possibility. James Dean was an actor, born in 1931, died in 1955. Not matching. Marilyn Monroe was born in 1926, died in 1962. No.

Elvis Presley is the most iconic figure that matches this description.

The question says to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. Since the question is straightforward, I don't need to add extra information, but I can reason step by step as I'm doing now.

Finally, the answer is Elvis Presley.
