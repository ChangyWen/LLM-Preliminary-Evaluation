*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1920, died in 2005, and known as the '264th pope of the Catholic Church'.

I need to recall who the 264th pope was. I know that Pope John Paul II was a pope in the late 20th and early 21st century. Let me confirm his birth and death years.

Pope John Paul II was born in 1920 and died in 2005. Yes, that matches the given dates.

Now, is he the 264th pope? I think he is. Pope John Paul II served from 1978 to 2005. Before him was Pope John Paul I, and before that Pope Paul VI. I believe the numbering is correct; he is indeed listed as the 264th pope in the Catholic Church's papal list.

To double-check, I can think about the sequence: Pope John Paul II succeeded Pope John Paul I, who succeeded Pope Paul VI. The papal count should be accurate.

The question specifies "known for '264th pope of the Catholic Church'", so it's directly giving that identifier. So, Pope John Paul II fits perfectly.

His real name was Karol Józef Wojtyła, but he is commonly known as Pope John Paul II.

The question asks for the name of the historical figure. In historical contexts, he is referred to as Pope John Paul II, but his birth name was Karol Wojtyła. However, when people say "the pope," they usually refer to his papal name.

Looking back at the question: "the name of the historical figure who was born in 1920, died in 2005, and is known for '264th pope of the Catholic Church'." So, the most appropriate answer is Pope John Paul II, as that's how he is known in that context.

Finally, the instruction is to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should lead to that, and then on a new line, state the answer.
