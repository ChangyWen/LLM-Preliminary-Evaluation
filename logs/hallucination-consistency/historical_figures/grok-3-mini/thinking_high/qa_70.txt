First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1940, died in 1996, and is known as a 'Russian-American poet'. I need to recall who that might be.

I know of Joseph Brodsky. He was a poet, and I think he was Russian-American. Let me confirm his birth and death years. I believe Joseph Brodsky was born in 1940 and died in 1996. Yes, that sounds right.

Joseph Brodsky was born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), Russia, in 1940. He was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1972 and moved to the United States, where he became a naturalized American citizen. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1987, and he was indeed a poet. So, he fits the description of a Russian-American poet.

Now, are there any other poets who might fit this description? Let me think. Born in 1940, died in 1996. That's a specific lifespan. I can't think of any other prominent Russian-American poet with those exact birth and death years.

Just to double-check: Brodsky was born on May 24, 1940, and died on January 28, 1996. Yes, that matches.

The question specifies 'Russian-American poet', and Brodsky is often referred to as such. He wrote in Russian initially but also in English later, and his work is celebrated in both contexts.

I think Joseph Brodsky is the correct answer.

The question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

Final answer: Joseph Brodsky
