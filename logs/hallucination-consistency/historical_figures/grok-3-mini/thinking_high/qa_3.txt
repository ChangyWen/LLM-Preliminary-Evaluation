*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1809, died in 1865, and known for being the 16th president of the United States (1809-1865).

I know that the 16th president of the United States is Abraham Lincoln. Let me confirm his birth and death years. Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, and he was assassinated on April 15, 1865. So, that matches the given years: born 1809, died 1865.

The description "known for '16th president of the United States (1809-1865)'" directly points to Lincoln, as the years in parentheses likely refer to his lifespan.

I should check if there's any other historical figure who fits this description. The 16th president is unambiguously Abraham Lincoln. No other president or figure shares these exact birth and death years and the title.

The question specifies "historical figure" and gives the presidential title, so it's clear.

Finally, the instruction is to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be concise, and end with the answer on a new line.
