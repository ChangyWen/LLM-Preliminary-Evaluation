*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1927, died in 2010, and is known as a 'Dutch writer'. I need to recall who that might be.

I'm thinking about famous Dutch writers. One that comes to mind is Anne Frank, but she was born in 1929 and died in 1945, so that doesn't match. Born in 1927, died in 2010 â€“ that's a long life, so probably not someone who died young.

Another Dutch writer I know is Harry Mulisch, but I'm not sure about his birth and death years. Let me think: I think he was born in 1927. Yes, Harry Mulisch was a prominent Dutch writer, author of books like "The Assault". I believe he died in 2010. Let me confirm that in my knowledge.

Upon recalling, Harry Mulisch was indeed born on July 29, 1927, and he died on October 30, 2010. That matches the dates perfectly.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let's see, another famous Dutch writer is Gerard Reve, but he was born in 1923 and died in 2006, so not matching. Or Cees Nooteboom, born in 1933, still alive or died later. No, that doesn't fit.

What about Multatuli? That's a 19th-century writer, so way before 1927.

Or Jan Wolkers, born in 1925, died in 2007, close but not exact.

So, Harry Mulisch seems to be the one. He's well-known for his novels, essays, and is considered one of the "Great Three" of Dutch post-war literature, along with Willem Frederik Hermans and Gerard Reve.

The question specifies 'Dutch writer', and Mulisch is indeed Dutch and a writer.

Now, the question says to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and directly answer the question. Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll keep it concise.

Final answer should be: Harry Mulisch

I think that's it.
