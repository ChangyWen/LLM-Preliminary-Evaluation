*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1908, died in 1973, and known for being the 28th president of Chile during that period. The phrase in quotes is '28th president of Chile (1908–1973)', which seems to be a description or a title.

I need to recall who the 28th president of Chile was. I'm not an expert on Chilean history, but I can think about famous Chilean presidents. I know Salvador Allende was a president of Chile, and he died in 1973. Let me confirm his birth year. I think he was born in 1908.

Yes, Salvador Allende was born on June 26, 1908, and he died on September 11, 1973. He was the president of Chile from 1970 to 1973, but the user says "28th president of Chile (1908–1973)". The (1908–1973) might refer to his lifespan, not his term. Let me check that.

Upon thinking, Allende's term was from 1970 to 1973, but he was born in 1908 and died in 1973. So the description matches: born 1908, died 1973, and he is indeed a historical figure known for being president of Chile.

Now, is he the 28th president? I should verify that. From my knowledge, yes, Salvador Allende is often referred to as the 28th president of Chile. His presidency was from November 3, 1970, to September 11, 1973.

The user says "known for '28th president of Chile (1908–1973)'", which likely means the figure is identified by that title, with the dates being birth and death years.

Are there any other figures who fit this description? Probably not, as the birth and death years are specific. Let me double-check if there's any other president with similar dates.

Other Chilean presidents: for example, Arturo Alessandri was president earlier, but he was born in 1868 and died in 1950, so that doesn't match. Eduardo Frei Montalva was president from 1964 to 1970, born in 1911, died in 1982, so not matching.

Salvador Allende fits perfectly: born 1908, died 1973, and was the 28th president.

The user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be straightforward, and end with the name.

Final answer: Salvador Allende

I should make sure the format is correct. The user said "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So I'll write a bit of reasoning or confirmation, but since the instruction is to reason step by step, I'll do that, and then put the answer.

In this case, as an AI, I can confirm that based on historical records, Salvador Allende matches all the criteria.
