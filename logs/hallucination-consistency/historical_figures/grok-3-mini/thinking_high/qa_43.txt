*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1524, died in 1580, and is known as a 'Portuguese poet'. I need to recall who that might be.

I know some famous Portuguese figures. Luís de Camões comes to mind. He's often called the Portuguese Shakespeare and wrote "Os Lusíadas", which is a famous epic poem.

Let me check the dates. I think Luís de Camões was born in 1524 and died in 1580. That sounds familiar. Born in 1524, died in 1580, and he's definitely a Portuguese poet.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? I'm not aware of any other prominent Portuguese poet with those exact birth and death years. Camões is the most famous one, and his dates match perfectly.

Just to double-check: Born 1524, died 1580. Yes, that's standard knowledge. He's known for his poetry, especially "Os Lusíadas" published in 1572.

The question specifies "known for 'Portuguese poet'", which is a bit redundant since it's already stated, but it confirms the nationality and profession.

My final answer should be Luís de Camões. I need to present it in a new line at the end of my response.

So, the response should be: [reasoning], and then on a new line, the answer.

Finally, box the answer as per the instruction. The user said "put your final answer within \boxed{}", so I need to do that.

Answer: Luís de Camões
