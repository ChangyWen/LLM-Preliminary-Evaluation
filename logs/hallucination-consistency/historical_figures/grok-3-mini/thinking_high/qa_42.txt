First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1877, died in 1960, and described as a "Chilean army officer and political figure (1877-1960)".

I need to recall or know who this person is. The description matches someone famous in Chilean history. I think it's Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. Let me confirm the dates.

Carlos Ibáñez del Campo was a Chilean military officer and politician. He was born in 1877 and died in 1960. Yes, that sounds right. He served as President of Chile twice, in the 1920s and again in the 1950s.

Let me double-check the dates. Born in 1877, died in 1960 – that matches. And he's known for being a Chilean army officer and political figure.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? I don't think so. Augusto Pinochet was much later, born in 1915, so that doesn't match. Salvador Allende was born in 1908, died in 1973, so not him. Arturo Alessandri was born in 1868, died in 1950, close but not exact dates.

So, Carlos Ibáñez del Campo seems to be the correct figure.

The question says to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So I should structure my response accordingly.

Finally, box the answer as per the instruction. The user said "put your final answer within \boxed{}", so I need to do that.

Response structure: I can have a brief reasoning, but since the user didn't ask for it, I might just state the answer. But to be helpful, I'll keep it concise.

Final answer: Carlos Ibáñez del Campo.
