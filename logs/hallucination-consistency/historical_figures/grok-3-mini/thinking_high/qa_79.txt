First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1872, died in 1928, and known as a Norwegian explorer who was the first person to reach the South Pole.

I need to recall who that is. I think it's Roald Amundsen. Let me verify the details.

Roald Amundsen was a Norwegian explorer. He led the first expedition to reach the South Pole in 1911. That matches the description.

Now, check the birth and death years. He was born in 1872 and died in 1928. Yes, that's correct. He died in a plane crash in 1928 while searching for survivors of an airship expedition.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Robert Falcon Scott was also involved in Antarctic exploration, but he was British and reached the South Pole after Amundsen, and he didn't survive. Scott was born in 1868 and died in 1912, so that doesn't match.

Amundsen is definitely the one who was first to the South Pole and fits the dates.

The question says "first person to reach the South Pole," which is unambiguously Amundsen.

Finally, the response should end with the answer on a new line. So, I'll write my reasoning and then put the name on a new line.

Answer: Roald Amundsen
