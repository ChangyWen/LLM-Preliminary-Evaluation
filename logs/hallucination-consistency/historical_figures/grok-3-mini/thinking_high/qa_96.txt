First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1785, died in 1873, and is known as an "Italian poet and novelist (1785-1873)".

I need to recall who this might be. The description matches Alessandro Manzoni, who is a famous Italian writer. Let me confirm his birth and death years.

Alessandro Manzoni was born in 1785 and died in 1873. Yes, that sounds right. He's best known for his novel "The Betrothed" (I Promessi Sposi), which is a cornerstone of Italian literature.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think. The years 1785-1873 are specific, and the description specifies "Italian poet and novelist." Manzoni is indeed Italian and fits both categories.

Just to double-check, Manzoni was involved in the Italian unification movement and is often called the father of the modern Italian language because of his work.

The question says "known for 'Italian poet and novelist (1785-1873)'", which seems like it's directly quoting a description, probably from a source like an encyclopedia or a database. So, it's likely referring to Manzoni.

Finally, the response should end with the name on a new line. So, I'll structure my answer accordingly.

My final answer is Alessandro Manzoni.
