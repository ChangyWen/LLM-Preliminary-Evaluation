First, the question asks for a historical figure born in 1712, died in 1779, and known as a "French veterinary surgeon."

I need to recall if I know any famous veterinary surgeons from that era. The description specifies "French," so it must be someone from France.

Let me think about historical figures. The years 1712-1779 sound familiar. I think of Benjamin Franklin, but he was American, born in 1706, died in 1790, and not a veterinary surgeon.

Perhaps it's someone else. I recall Claude Bourgelat. I think he was a French veterinary surgeon. Let me confirm the dates.

From my knowledge, Claude Bourgelat was born in 1712 and died in 1779. Yes, that matches. He is credited with founding the first veterinary school in the world in Lyon, France, in 1761. That definitely makes him a key figure in veterinary medicine.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? I'm not aware of any other prominent veterinary surgeons from that exact time period with those birth and death years.

The question says "known for 'French veterinary surgeon'", which might be a bit awkwardly phrased, but it probably means he is famous as a French veterinary surgeon.

So, Claude Bourgelat seems to be the answer.

Now, the question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should end with the name on a new line.

Final Answer:

Claude Bourgelat
