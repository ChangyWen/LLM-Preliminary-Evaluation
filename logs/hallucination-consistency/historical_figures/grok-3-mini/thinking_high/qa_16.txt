*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure with specific details: born in 1188, died in 1252, and described as a "Spanish princess and saint, queen consort of France."

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds familiar. I think it's Saint Louis's mother or something related to French royalty.

Let me think about queens consort of France. One famous one is Eleanor of Aquitaine, but she was born in 1122 and died in 1204, which doesn't match the dates.

The dates are 1188 to 1252. Who was queen consort during that time? Louis VIII or Louis IX might be involved.

Louis IX of France, also known as Saint Louis, was born in 1214 and died in 1270. His mother was Blanche of Castile. Let me check her dates.

Blanche of Castile was a Spanish princess, from Castile, which is in Spain. She was married to Louis VIII of France and was the mother of Louis IX.

Now, her birth and death dates: I think she was born in 1188 and died in 1252. That matches the given dates.

She is also known as a saint? Is Blanche of Castile a saint? I'm not sure. The question says "saint," so I need to confirm that.

Upon thinking, I recall that Blanche of Castile is not canonized as a saint. Let me double-check.

Perhaps it's someone else. Another famous Spanish princess who was queen of France is Isabella of France, but she was later, wife of Edward II of England, not France.

Let's list out possibilities.

Maybe it's Joan of England or someone, but the description specifies "Spanish princess."

Blanche of Castile: born 1188, died 1252, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Eleanor of England, so yes, Spanish princess. She married Louis VIII of France in 1200, and after his death, she acted as regent for her son Louis IX.

Is she considered a saint? I don't think so. She was pious and influential, but not canonized.

Perhaps the question is referring to her as "saint" in a broader sense, or maybe it's a mistake.

Another figure: Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, but she was not a queen of France; she was married to Louis IV of Thuringia.

Not matching.

Saint Margaret of Scotland, but she was queen of Scotland, not France.

Perhaps it's Blanche of Castile, and the "saint" part might be incorrect, or maybe she is venerated in some way.

Upon second thought, I think Blanche of Castile is not a saint. Let me think of another possibility.

The description is "Spanish princess and saint, queen consort of France." So all three must apply.

Who is a saint and was queen consort of France?

I recall Saint Clotilde, who was a queen consort of the Franks, but she lived in the 5th-6th century, not matching dates.

Saint Bathilde, also earlier.

Perhaps it's not Blanche.

Let's search my memory for women born in 1188.

Born 1188: that would be around the time of the Third Crusade or so.

Perhaps it's Eleanor of Castile, but she was born later, in 1241, and was queen of England.

Not matching.

Maybe the "saint" is a red herring or misremembered.

But the question specifies it, so probably it's correct.

Another thought: is there a Saint Louis, but that's male.

Louis IX is a saint, but he's not a princess.

Perhaps it's his wife or something, but Margaret of Provence was queen consort, but not Spanish and not a saint.

Let's confirm Blanche of Castile's status.

Upon recalling, Blanche of Castile is sometimes called "blessed" or venerated, but not officially a saint. However, in some contexts, she might be referred to as such.

Perhaps the figure is Saint Ferdinand, but that's male, king of Castile.

No.

Let's think differently. Maybe it's Isabella of France, but she was born in 1295.

Not matching dates.

Perhaps it's Joan of England, but not Spanish.

I think it must be Blanche of Castile. The dates match perfectly: born 1188, died 1252.

And she is indeed a Spanish princess (from Castile) and queen consort of France.

Regarding "saint," perhaps it's a mistake in my knowledge, or maybe she is considered a saint in some traditions.

Upon double-checking my internal knowledge, I believe Blanche of Castile is not canonized, but she was very devout and played a key role in the church.

But the question says "saint," so maybe it's her.

Perhaps it's Saint Elizabeth of Portugal, but she was born in 1271, died 1336, not matching.

Another one: Saint Hedwig of Silesia, but not French queen.

I think Blanche of Castile is the only one that fits the dates and the roles.

Perhaps the "saint" part is incorrect, but since the question states it, I'll go with Blanche.

Or maybe it's a different person.

Let's think: is there a Saint who was queen of France with those dates?

Upon searching my memory, I recall that Louis IX's mother is often associated with sanctity, but not formally a saint.

Perhaps the figure is canonized under a different name.

Another thought: Saint Louis is Louis IX, but he's not the one described.

I should conclude that it's Blanche of Castile.

And in many historical contexts, she is referred to as a saintly figure.

So, I'll go with that.

The name is Blanche of Castile.

To be precise, her full name is Blanche of Castile, and she is known as such.

So, the answer should be Blanche of Castile.

Now, the question asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, I'll write my response and then the answer.
