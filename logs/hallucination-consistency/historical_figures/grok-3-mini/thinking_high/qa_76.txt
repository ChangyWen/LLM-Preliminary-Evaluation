*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1899, died in 1986, and described as an "Argentine short story writer, essayist, poet and translator (1899-1986)."

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds familiar. I think it's Jorge Luis Borges. Let me confirm the details.

Jorge Luis Borges was an Argentine writer, known for his short stories, essays, poetry, and translations. He was born in 1899 and died in 1986. That matches perfectly.

To be thorough, let's make sure there aren't other figures who fit this description. Borges is one of the most famous Argentine writers, especially in the 20th century, and his birth and death years are well-known.

The description specifies "Argentine," so it has to be someone from Argentina. Borges is indeed Argentine.

The phrase in parentheses "(1899-1986)" is exactly the lifespan given, so it reinforces that it's Borges.

I don't think there's any other prominent figure with the same birth and death years and similar occupations. Borges is iconic for his contributions to literature, including works like "Ficciones" and "The Aleph."

So, my final answer should be Jorge Luis Borges.

The question says to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So I'll structure my response accordingly.
