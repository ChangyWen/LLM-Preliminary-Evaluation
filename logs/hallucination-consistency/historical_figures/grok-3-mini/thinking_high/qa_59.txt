*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1898, died in 1980, and known as a "Chilean politician (1898-1980)". I need to recall who this might be.

I know that Salvador Allende was a famous Chilean politician. Let me check his birth and death years. I think he was born in 1908 and died in 1973. That doesn't match because the user said born in 1898 and died in 1980.

1898 to 1980. Who could that be? Maybe it's someone else. Let me think about other Chilean politicians.

Perhaps it's Augusto Pinochet. He was a dictator in Chile. I think he was born in 1915 and died in 2006. That doesn't match either.

The description says "known for 'Chilean politician (1898-1980)'". This might be a direct reference to how he's described in some database or encyclopedia. Maybe it's Eduardo Frei Montalva. I think he was a president of Chile.

Let me recall: Eduardo Frei Montalva was born in 1911 and died in 1982. Close but not exact. Born in 1911, not 1898.

1898 is earlier. Who was born in 1898 in Chile and was a politician?

Perhaps it's Arturo Alessandri Palma. I think he was a president. Let me think: Arturo Alessandri was born in 1868 and died in 1950. No, that's not it.

Maybe it's someone less famous. But the user specifies "historical figure" and gives the years, so it should be someone notable.

Let's think about Gabriel González Videla. I think he was born in 1898. Yes, Gabriel González Videla was a Chilean politician, president from 1946 to 1952. When did he die? I think he died in 1980. Let me confirm that.

Upon recalling, Gabriel González Videla was born on November 22, 1898, and died on August 22, 1980. That matches perfectly: born 1898, died 1980, and he was a Chilean politician.

Is he well-known? He was president during a significant period, including the time when Pablo Neruda was persecuted, but he might not be as famous as Allende or Pinochet, but the description fits.

The user said "known for 'Chilean politician (1898-1980)'", which sounds like it could be from a Wikipedia page or something similar. If I search for Chilean politicians born in 1898 and died in 1980, González Videla fits.

Just to double-check, is there anyone else? Juan Antonio Ríos was president, born 1888, died 1946. No.

Pedro Aguirre Cerda, born 1879, died 1941. No.

So, Gabriel González Videla seems to be the one.

Now, the user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be straightforward, and end with the name.

Let me structure it: I can say something like, "Based on the details provided, the historical figure is Gabriel González Videla."

Then, on a new line, just the name.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I should have some reasoning or confirmation, but since I'm an AI, I can just state it, but to make it helpful, I can confirm.

As an AI, I should provide accurate information. Let me make sure.

Upon second thought, is there a more prominent figure? Salvador Allende is more famous, but years don't match. Perhaps it's a trick, but no, the years are specific.

Maybe it's not a politician, but the user specifies "Chilean politician".

Another one: Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. He was a president, born 1877, died 1960. No.

So, yes, Gabriel González Videla is correct.

Final answer should be Gabriel González Videla.
