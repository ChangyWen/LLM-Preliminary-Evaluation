First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1564, died in 1616, and known as an "English playwright and poet."

I need to recall who fits this description. The most famous English playwright and poet born in 1564 and died in 1616 is William Shakespeare. Let me confirm the dates: Shakespeare was indeed born in 1564 and died in 1616. He's widely recognized for works like Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, and many sonnets.

Are there any other figures that might fit this? I don't think so. Christopher Marlowe was a contemporary, but he was born in 1564 and died in 1593, not 1616. Ben Jonson was born in 1572 and died in 1637, so that doesn't match. John Donne was a poet, born in 1572 and died in 1631, also not a match.

So, William Shakespeare is the clear answer.

The question specifies to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly. I can have some reasoning or confirmation in the body, but end with the answer on a new line.

Finally, the answer should be just the name: William Shakespeare.
