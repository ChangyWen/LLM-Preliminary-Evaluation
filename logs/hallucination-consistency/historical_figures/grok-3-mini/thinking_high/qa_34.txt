*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure with specific details: born in 1938, died in 1980, and known as a 'Soviet singer, songwriter, poet, and actor'.

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds familiar. I think it's Vladimir Vysotsky. Let me verify the details.

Vladimir Vysotsky was a famous Soviet artist. He was indeed a singer, songwriter, poet, and actor. Now, check the birth and death years.

He was born in 1938. Yes, that's correct. And he died in 1980. I believe that's right too; he died young, probably from health issues related to his lifestyle.

Confirm the description: Soviet singer, songwriter, poet, and actor. Vysotsky is well-known for his bard songs, poetry, and acting in films and theater in the Soviet Union.

Are there any other figures that might fit this description? Let me think. Someone else born in 1938 and died in 1980? I can't think of anyone else who matches all these criteria. For example, other Soviet figures like Yuri Gagarin was an astronaut, not a singer or poet. Or composers like Shostakovich, but he was born much earlier and died later.

Shostakovich was born in 1906 and died in 1975, so not him. Another famous Soviet poet might be Yevgeny Yevtushenko, but he was born in 1932 and died in 2017, so not matching.

Vysotsky seems to be the perfect match.

Just to be thorough, let's recall his full name: Vladimir Semyonovich Vysotsky.

The question asks for the name, and to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should lead to that, but since this is reasoning, I'll keep it clear.

Final answer should be: Vladimir Vysotsky

I think it's commonly known as Vladimir Vysotsky, but to be precise, it's Vladimir Vysotsky.

In English, it's often spelled Vysotsky, but sometimes transliterated differently, but I think Vysotsky is standard.

The question says "the name," so probably first and last name.

Looking back at the question: "What is the name of the historical figure..." and it gives the description.

So, I'll go with Vladimir Vysotsky.
