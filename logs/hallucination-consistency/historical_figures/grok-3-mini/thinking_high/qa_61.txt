*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1891, died in 1940, and is known as a 'Russian author'. I need to recall who that might be.

I know several famous Russian authors. For example, Leo Tolstoy, but he was born in 1828 and died in 1910, so that's not it. Fyodor Dostoevsky was born in 1821 and died in 1881, too early. Anton Chekhov was born in 1860 and died in 1904, still not matching.

Now, thinking about authors born around 1891. Mikhail Bulgakov comes to mind. I think he was born in 1891. Let me confirm the death year. I believe he died in 1940. Yes, that sounds right. He's known for works like "The Master and Margarita," and he was a Russian author.

Is there anyone else? Vladimir Nabokov was born in 1899, so that's close but not 1891. He died in 1977, anyway. Boris Pasternak was born in 1890, which is close but not exactly 1891, and he died in 1960. The question specifies born in 1891, so Pasternak might not fit.

Let me double-check Bulgakov's birth and death years. I think Mikhail Bulgakov was indeed born on May 15, 1891, and died on March 10, 1940. That matches perfectly.

Is there any other Russian author born in 1891? Yevgeny Zamyatin was born in 1884 and died in 1937, not matching. Isaac Babel was born in 1894 and died in 1940, close but birth year is off. Anna Akhmatova was born in 1889 and died in 1966, not a match.

So, Mikhail Bulgakov seems to be the correct answer.

The question says "known for 'Russian author'", which is a bit vague, but it's probably just emphasizing that the person is a Russian author. Bulgakov fits all the criteria.

Finally, I need to present the answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I'll write my reasoning and then put the name on a new line.
