*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1473, died in 1543, and known as a Renaissance-era mathematician, astronomer, and clergyman who formulated the heliocentric model of the Universe.

I need to recall who this is. The heliocentric model is the idea that the Sun is at the center of the Universe, not the Earth. The person most famous for that is Nicolaus Copernicus.

Let me verify the dates. Copernicus was born in 1473 and died in 1543. Yes, that's correct.

He was a mathematician, astronomer, and also a clergyman. Copernicus was a canon in the Catholic Church, so that fits.

He formulated the heliocentric model in his book "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium," published in 1543, the year he died.

Is there anyone else who might fit this description? Galileo came later and supported the heliocentric model but didn't formulate it; he was born in 1564. Kepler was also later, born in 1571. So, Copernicus is the one.

The question specifies "Renaissance-era," which Copernicus is part of, as the Renaissance spanned the 14th to 17th centuries.

Finally, the answer should be given in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be straightforward, and then on a new line, just the name.

Response structure: I can have a brief confirmation or reasoning, but since the question says "please give me your final answer in a new line," I'll keep it concise.

Final answer: Nicolaus Copernicus.
