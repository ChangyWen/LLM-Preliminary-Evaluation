*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question asks for a historical figure who was born in 1937, died in 2012, and is known as a 'Dutch writer and translator'. I need to identify who that is.

I'm thinking about famous Dutch writers or translators. The Netherlands has produced many notable figures in literature. Someone born in 1937 and died in 2012 would have lived to be 75 years old (2012 - 1937 = 75).

Who could that be? I recall Harry Mulisch, a famous Dutch writer. Let me check his birth and death years. I think Harry Mulisch was born in 1927, not 1937. That doesn't match.

What about Gerard Reve? He was a Dutch writer. I think he was born in 1923 and died in 2006. Not matching.

Perhaps it's someone less famous or I'm not recalling correctly. The description is specific: 'Dutch writer and translator'. Maybe it's not one of the most famous ones.

Let me think about translators. Is there a well-known Dutch translator born in 1937?

Perhaps it's Cees Nooteboom. He's a Dutch writer. I think he was born in 1933, and he's still alive or died later. No, I think he's still alive, born in 1933, so not 1937.

Maybe it's someone else. Let me try to recall. What about Jan Wolkers? He was a Dutch writer, born in 1925, died in 2007. Not matching.

Perhaps it's a lesser-known figure. But the question specifies "historical figure," so it should be someone notable.

Another name: Willem Frederik Hermans. He was born in 1921 and died in 1995. No.

Let's think about the years: born 1937, died 2012. That's a specific lifespan.

I think there might be a mistake or I'm missing someone. Perhaps it's Harry Mulisch again, but I think he was born in 1927. Let me double-check my knowledge.

Upon second thought, I recall that Harry Mulisch was indeed born in 1927, not 1937. So that's not it.

Maybe it's a translator more than a writer. Or perhaps a writer who also translated.

Let's search my memory for Dutch figures born in 1937.

I think of Annie M.G. Schmidt, but she was born in 1911 and died in 1995. No.

What about Hugo Claus? He was Belgian, not Dutch, and born in 1929, died in 2008.

Perhaps it's Gerrit Komrij. He was a Dutch writer, poet, and translator. Let me check his birth year. I think he was born in 1944, died in 2012. Wait, born in 1944? That doesn't match 1937.

Died in 2012, but born in 1944 would make him 68, but the birth year is wrong.

The question says born in 1937, died in 2012.

Let me think of someone else. Perhaps it's Simon Vestdijk, but he died earlier.

Another name: Cees Buddingh'. He was a Dutch writer and translator. Let me recall his years. I think he was born in 1918 and died in 1985. No.

Perhaps it's Remco Campert. He was born in 1929 and is still alive or died recently. I think he's still alive, born 1929.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let's consider if the figure is not primarily known as a writer but as a translator, or vice versa.

Perhaps it's a historical figure in a different context, but the description is clear.

I recall that there is a Dutch writer named J. Bernlef, whose real name was Hendrik Jan Marsman. He was born in 1937 and died in 2012. Let me confirm that.

Yes, J. Bernlef was a Dutch writer and translator. He wrote poetry, novels, and was known for his translations. Born on January 14, 1937, and died on October 29, 2012. That matches perfectly.

He is indeed known for works like "Hersenschimmen" (Out of Mind), and he was a prominent figure in Dutch literature.

So, the historical figure is J. Bernlef.

Now, the question asks for the name, and to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my final answer should be J. Bernlef.

Is that the common way to refer to him? Yes, he is often known by his pen name J. Bernlef.

Sometimes he is referred to as Bernlef or J. Bernlef.

I think that's correct.
