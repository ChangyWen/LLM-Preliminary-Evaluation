First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these specific details:

- Born in 1921

- Died in 1989

- Known as a 'Soviet nuclear physicist and human rights activist'

I need to recall or know who fits this description. From my knowledge, Andrei Sakharov comes to mind. Let me verify:

- Andrei Sakharov was a Soviet physicist who played a key role in developing the Soviet hydrogen bomb, so he's a nuclear physicist.

- He was also a prominent human rights activist, advocating for civil liberties and against nuclear proliferation.

- Birth year: He was born on May 21, 1921.

- Death year: He died on December 14, 1989.

That matches perfectly.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think. Other famous Soviet physicists include Igor Kurchatov or Lev Landau, but they weren't known as human rights activists. Kurchatov was the father of the Soviet atomic bomb but didn't engage in activism like Sakharov. Landau was a theoretical physicist but not an activist.

Sakharov is the one who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 for his human rights work, which aligns with the description.

So, I'm confident that Andrei Sakharov is the correct answer.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly. Maybe keep it concise since the query is straightforward.

Final response structure:

- I can start with a brief confirmation or just directly state it, but since it's a direct question, I'll go straight to the point.

- End with the answer on a new line.
