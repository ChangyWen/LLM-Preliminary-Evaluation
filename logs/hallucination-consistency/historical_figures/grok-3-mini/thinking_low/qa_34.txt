*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1938

- Died in 1980

- Known as a 'Soviet singer, songwriter, poet, and actor'

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds like Vladimir Vysotsky. Let me verify his details.

Vladimir Vysotsky was a famous Soviet artist. He was born on January 25, 1938, and died on July 25, 1980. He was indeed a singer, songwriter, poet, and actor. He starred in films and was known for his bard songs and poetry in the Soviet Union.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think. Another prominent figure from that era might be someone like Bulat Okudzhava, but he was born in 1924 and died in 1997, so that doesn't match.

What about Viktor Tsoi? He was born in 1957 and died in 1990, so not him.

Or perhaps Yuri Gagarin, but he was a cosmonaut, not a singer, songwriter, etc., and he died in 1968.

No, Vysotsky seems to be the perfect match.

The user specified 'Soviet singer, songwriter, poet and actor', which aligns perfectly with Vysotsky's biography.

The instruction is to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward query, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end. So, something like:

After reasoning, the historical figure is Vladimir Vysotsky.

Then, on a new line: Vladimir Vysotsky

To make it clear, I'll say: The historical figure is Vladimir Vysotsky.

And then on a new line: Vladimir Vysotsky

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, perhaps my response can be: Based on the details provided, the historical figure is Vladimir Vysotsky.

Final answer:

Vladimir Vysotsky

That seems appropriate.
