First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1868

- Died in 1950

- Known for being a Chilean politician and President

I need to recall or know who fits this description. I'm thinking of famous Chilean presidents.

One that comes to mind is Arturo Alessandri Palma. Let me verify his dates:

- Arturo Alessandri was born on December 20, 1868.

- He died on March 24, 1950.

That matches the birth and death years.

He was indeed a Chilean politician and served as President of Chile twice: from 1920 to 1925 and from 1932 to 1938. So, he fits the description perfectly.

Is there anyone else who might fit? Let me double-check.

Another prominent Chilean figure is Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, but his birth year is 1877, not 1868. So, no.

What about Pedro Aguirre Cerda? He was president from 1938 to 1941, but born in 1879.

Or Gabriel González Videla, born in 1898.

No, Arturo Alessandri seems to be the one.

Just to be thorough, let's confirm if there's any other president born in 1868. From my knowledge, no.

So, the answer should be Arturo Alessandri.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward query, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
