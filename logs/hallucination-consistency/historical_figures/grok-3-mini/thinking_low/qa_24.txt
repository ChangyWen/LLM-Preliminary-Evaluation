First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1908, died in 1973, and is known for being the '28th president of Chile (1908–1973)'.

The description says '28th president of Chile (1908–1973)'. This might be a clue. Typically, when we say someone is the president from certain years, like 1908–1973, that would mean their term was from 1908 to 1973. But that doesn't make sense because a person born in 1908 couldn't be president starting in the same year they were born.

Perhaps it's a formatting error. It might mean the person was born in 1908, died in 1973, and was the 28th president of Chile during some period within that lifespan.

I need to recall who the 28th president of Chile was. I'm not an expert on Chilean history, but I can think about this logically.

From my knowledge, Chilean presidents include figures like Salvador Allende, who was president from 1970 to 1973 and died in 1973. He was born in 1908. Let me verify that.

Yes, Salvador Allende was born on June 26, 1908, and died on September 11, 1973. He was the President of Chile from 1970 until his death in 1973.

Was he the 28th president? I need to confirm that. Upon quick mental recall, yes, Salvador Allende is often referred to as the 28th President of Chile.

The description says '28th president of Chile (1908–1973)', which likely means he was born in 1908 and died in 1973, and he was the 28th president.

That matches perfectly with Salvador Allende.

So, the historical figure is Salvador Allende.
