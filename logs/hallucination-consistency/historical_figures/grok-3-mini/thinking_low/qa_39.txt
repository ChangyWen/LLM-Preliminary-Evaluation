*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1712

- Died in 1779

- Known as a 'French veterinary surgeon'

I need to recall or know who this person is. From my knowledge, the most famous French veterinary surgeon from that era is Claude Bourgelat.

Let me verify the details:

- Claude Bourgelat was indeed born in 1712.

- He died in 1778, not 1779. Wait, is that accurate?

I think I might have that wrong. Let me double-check my internal knowledge. Upon reflection, I believe Claude Bourgelat was born on August 27, 1712, and died on March 9, 1779. Yes, that matches: born 1712, died 1779.

He is credited as the founder of veterinary colleges and is known as a French veterinary surgeon. He established the first veterinary school in Lyon in 1761.

So, that seems to fit perfectly.

Is there anyone else who matches this description? I don't think so. He's the prominent figure in that field during that time.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward query, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.

Response structure:

- Optionally, a brief confirmation or explanation.

- Then, the final answer on a new line.

For example:

After verifying the details, the historical figure is Claude Bourgelat.

Final answer:

Claude Bourgelat

That should work.
