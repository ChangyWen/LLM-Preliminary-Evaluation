*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details: born in 1877, died in 1960, and described as a "Chilean army officer and political figure (1877-1960)."

I need to recall or know who this refers to. From my knowledge, this sounds like Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. Let me verify:

- Carlos Ibáñez del Campo was a Chilean military officer and politician.

- He was born on November 3, 1877.

- He died on April 28, 1960.

- He served as President of Chile twice: from 1927 to 1931 and from 1952 to 1958.

That matches the description perfectly.

Is there anyone else who fits this? Let me think. Another prominent Chilean figure around that time is Arturo Alessandri, but he was born in 1868 and died in 1950, so that doesn't match.

What about Augusto Pinochet? He was born in 1915 and died in 2006, which is way off.

So, Carlos Ibáñez del Campo is the correct one.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since the query is straightforward, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.
