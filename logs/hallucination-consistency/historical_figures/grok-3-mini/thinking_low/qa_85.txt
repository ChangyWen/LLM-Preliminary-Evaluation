First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who:

- Was born in 1908

- Died in 1991

- Is known as an 'American physicist and engineer'

I need to recall or know who fits this description. Let me think about famous American physicists and engineers from that era.

One name that comes to mind is Richard Feynman. But was he born in 1908? Feynman was born in 1918, so that's not right.

Another one: Enrico Fermi? He was Italian-American, but was he born in 1908? Fermi was born in 1901, and he died in 1954. Not matching.

What about J. Robert Oppenheimer? He was born in 1904 and died in 1967. Close but not exact.

Let's think of someone born in 1908. Edward Teller? He was born in 1908 and died in 1991. Is that right? Yes, Edward Teller was born on January 15, 1908, and died on September 9, 2003. Wait, no, that's not 1991. He died in 2003.

Hmm, wrong again. Let me double-check.

Perhaps it's John Bardeen. He was a physicist, born in 1908 and died in 1991. Is that accurate?

John Bardeen was born on May 23, 1908, and died on January 30, 1991. Yes! And he was an American physicist and engineer, known for his work in superconductivity and as one of the inventors of the transistor.

That seems to fit perfectly.

Is there anyone else? Let's confirm if there are other possibilities.

Another one: Luis Alvarez, born in 1911, died in 1988. Not matching.

Or Richard Feynman, as I thought, 1918-1988.

What about Vannevar Bush? He was born in 1890 and died in 1974. No.

Or Claude Shannon, born in 1916.

John Bardeen seems to be the one. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics twice, which is unique, and he was indeed an American physicist and electrical engineer.

So, I think John Bardeen is the answer.

The user said to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.
