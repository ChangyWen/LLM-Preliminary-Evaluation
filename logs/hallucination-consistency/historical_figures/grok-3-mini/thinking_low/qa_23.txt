First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1934

- Died in 1996

- Known as an 'American astrophysicist, cosmologist, author and science educator'

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds like Carl Sagan. Let me verify:

- Carl Sagan was born on November 9, 1934.

- He died on December 20, 1996.

- He was indeed an American astrophysicist, cosmologist, author (e.g., Cosmos, Contact), and a prominent science educator, especially through his TV series Cosmos.

That matches perfectly. I don't think there's another figure who fits this exact description.

Just to double-check, is there anyone else?

- Stephen Hawking was a cosmologist, but he was born in 1942 and died in 2018, so that doesn't match.

- Neil deGrasse Tyson is still alive and was born in 1958.

- Richard Feynman was a physicist, born in 1918 and died in 1988, so not matching.

- Carl Sagan is the one.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or just state it, but since the instruction is to reason step by step (as per my role), I'll keep this internal.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
