*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who:

- Was born in 1803

- Died in 1869

- Is known as a 'French Romantic composer'

I need to recall who fits this description. I know of several famous composers, but let's think about French Romantic ones.

Hector Berlioz comes to mind. Let me verify his dates:

- Berlioz was born on December 11, 1803.

- He died on March 8, 1869.

That matches the birth and death years.

Is he known as a French Romantic composer? Absolutely. He's one of the key figures in the Romantic era of music, famous for works like the Symphonie fantastique.

Are there any other composers who fit this exact description?

Let me double-check:

- Frédéric Chopin was born in 1810 and died in 1849, so no.

- Claude Debussy was born in 1862, way later.

- Richard Wagner was German, not French.

- Franz Liszt was Hungarian.

- Giuseppe Verdi was Italian.

- Robert Schumann was German.

So, Berlioz is the one who matches: French, Romantic composer, born 1803, died 1869.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since the query is straightforward, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.
