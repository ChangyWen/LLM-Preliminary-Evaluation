*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who meets these criteria:

- Born in 1920

- Died in 2005

- Known as the '264th pope of the Catholic Church'

I need to recall who that is. The popes are numbered, so the 264th pope would be Pope John Paul II. Let me double-check that.

Pope John Paul II was born on May 18, 1920, and he died on April 2, 2005. That matches the birth and death years.

Was he the 264th pope? Yes, according to Catholic Church records, Pope John Paul II is the 264th pope.

To be precise, the numbering might vary slightly depending on sources, but commonly, he is referred to as the 264th pope.

His full name is Karol Józef Wojtyła, but he is known as Pope John Paul II.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should end with the name on a new line.

Structure my response: I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer.

Final answer: Pope John Paul II

Is there any other pope who fits this description? No, because the dates are specific.

Just to confirm:

- Born: 1920

- Died: 2005

- 264th pope: Definitely Pope John Paul II.

Alright, let's formulate the response.
