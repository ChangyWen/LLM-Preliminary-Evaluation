*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1700

- Died in 1755

- Known as 'German-born French soldier and statesman (1700-1755)'

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds like it could be referring to Frederick the Great, but let me double-check.

Frederick the Great was born in 1712 and died in 1786, so that doesn't match.

Who was born in 1700 and died in 1755? That narrows it down.

I think it might be Frederick II of Prussia, but no, his dates are wrong.

Perhaps it's Maurice de Saxe. Let me think: Maurice de Saxe was a Marshal of France, born in 1696 and died in 1750. That's not right.

The description says "German-born French soldier and statesman." So, someone who was born in Germany but served France.

That rings a bell: It could be Hermann Maurice Saxe, but let's confirm.

Actually, I believe it's Maurice de Saxe, but his birth year is 1696, not 1700.

Maybe it's Frederick the Great's father, Frederick William I, but he was born in 1688 and died in 1740.

This is tricky. Let me think differently. Is there a famous figure exactly born in 1700 and died in 1755?

Perhaps it's Charles XII of Sweden, but he died in 1718.

No. Let's consider: The description is in quotes: 'German-born French soldier and statesmen (1700-1755)'. It might be a direct reference from a source.

I recall: It could be Frederick II, but dates don't match.

Another thought: Perhaps it's Prince Eugene of Savoy. He was born in 1663 and died in 1736, not matching.

Maybe it's Leopold II, but that's later.

Let's search my knowledge: Oh, wait, I think it's Maurice, Count de Saxe. Upon second thought, some sources might have approximate dates, but let's verify.

Actually, upon reflection, I believe the person is Hermann Maurice Saxe, but his birth is 1696.

Perhaps it's a mistake, or maybe it's someone else.

Wait, no: I found it â€“ it's likely referring to Frederick the Great, but dates are wrong. The user said 1700-1755, which is not accurate for him.

Perhaps it's George II of Great Britain, born 1683, died 1760.

This is not helping. Let me think of French soldiers.

Ah! I think it's Marshal Saxe, but dates don't match.

Upon double-checking my mental database, I recall that the figure is indeed Maurice de Saxe, and perhaps the birth year is approximated or misremembered.

But the user specified 1700, so maybe it's correct for this context.

Perhaps it's Johann Sebastian Bach, but he's not a soldier.

No. Let's consider: The description is "German-born French soldier and statesmen," so it's definitely a military figure.

After some thought, I believe it's Hermann Maurice, Count de Saxe, and his birth year is often listed as 1696, but perhaps in some sources as 1700.

Maybe it's Frederick of Prussia, but no.

Wait, another idea: Is it the Duke of Marlborough? John Churchill, born 1650, died 1722.

No.

Perhaps it's Charles de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois, but that's not it.

I need to conclude that the most likely candidate is Maurice de Saxe, even if the dates are off by a few years.

But the user said born in 1700, died in 1755, so let's assume that's correct.

Upon further reflection, I think the figure is Frederick II of Prussia, and the dates are incorrect in the query, but the query specifies 1700-1755, which is not right.

Perhaps it's a typo, and it's 1712-1786 for Frederick.

But the user is quoting it as is.

Wait, no: The query says "known for 'German-born French soldier and statesmen (1700-1755)'", so it's describing the figure as such.

Upon searching my knowledge, I realize that there might be a mistake, but I think the intended figure is Maurice de Saxe.

Let's confirm online in my mind: Maurice de Saxe was born on 28 October 1696 and died on 20 November 1750. So, not matching.

Perhaps it's Louis XV, but he's French-born.

This is confusing. Maybe it's Voltaire, but he's not a soldier.

Another thought: Is it the Baron de Montesquieu? Born 1689, died 1755, but not a soldier.

Died in 1755, born 1689, not 1700.

Close, but not.

Perhaps it's Johann Bernoulli, but not a soldier.

I need to think differently. Maybe it's a less famous figure.

Upon second thought, I recall that there is a figure named Frederick, but no.

Let's consider: The description might be for Prince Frederick of Hesse-Kassel or something, but that's not it.

Perhaps it's the Landgrave of Hesse, but I'm not sure.

After some more thinking, I believe the figure is Hermann Maurice Saxe, and perhaps the birth year is 1696, but the user has 1700.

Maybe it's a different person: Wait, is it the Duke of Cumberland? William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, born 1721, died 1765, not matching.

This is taking too long. Perhaps I should go with Maurice de Saxe as the closest match.

But let's assume the user is correct, and the figure is known as such.

Upon final recollection, I think the historical figure is Maurice de Saxe, and I'll go with that.

So, my final answer will be Maurice de Saxe.

The user asked for the name, and to put it in a new line at the end.

So, I'll say: The historical figure is Maurice de Saxe.
