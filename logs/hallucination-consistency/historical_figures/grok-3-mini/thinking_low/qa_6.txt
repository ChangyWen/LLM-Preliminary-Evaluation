*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1790

- Died in 1832

- Known as a 'French classical scholar'

I need to recall or know who this person is. I'm an AI, so I have access to general knowledge.

Thinking about famous French classical scholars from that era. Classical scholars typically study ancient Greece and Rome, so someone involved in philology, history, or literature from that period.

The years: 1790 to 1832. That's a lifespan of 42 years.

One name that comes to mind is Jean-François Champollion. Let me verify his details.

- Jean-François Champollion was born on December 23, 1790.

- He died on October 4, 1832.

- He is famous for deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs, which involves classical studies, but is he specifically a "French classical scholar"?

Classical scholar usually refers to someone who studies ancient Greek and Roman classics. Champollion is more associated with Egyptology, which is related but not exactly the same.

Is there another figure? Let me think.

Another possibility: Perhaps it's someone like Guizot or someone else, but let's double-check.

The user specified "French classical scholar," and Champollion is French and a scholar of ancient languages.

Upon second thought, Champollion is often called a scholar of ancient languages, and his work is in the realm of classical studies broadly.

Is there a more precise match? Let me recall if there's someone else born in 1790 and died in 1832.

Another name: François Arago? No, he's a physicist.

Perhaps it's Augustin Thierry, but his dates don't match.

Let's confirm Champollion's description. He is indeed a French scholar, and his work on hieroglyphs is pivotal in understanding ancient civilizations, which overlaps with classical studies.

The user might be referring to him as the most prominent figure fitting that description.

Is there someone like Barthélemy d'Herbelot? No, that's earlier.

Perhaps it's Pierre-Simon Ballanche, but I don't think so.

Upon reflection, Jean-François Champollion seems to be the best match. He's widely known, and his dates are exact.

So, I'll go with that.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

Structure my response:

- I can have a brief explanation if needed, but since they said "please give me your final answer in a new line at the end," I'll keep it concise.

Final answer: Jean-François Champollion
