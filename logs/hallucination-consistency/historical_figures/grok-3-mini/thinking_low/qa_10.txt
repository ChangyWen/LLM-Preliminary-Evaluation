*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1541

- Died in 1614

- Known as a 'Greek painter, sculptor and architect'

I need to recall if there's a famous historical figure that matches this description.

I know of El Greco. Let me verify his details:

- El Greco's real name was Doménikos Theotokópoulos.

- He was born in 1541 in Crete, which was part of the Republic of Venice at the time, and Crete is in Greece, so he's often referred to as Greek.

- He died in 1614 in Spain.

- He was indeed a painter, and while he's primarily known as a painter, he also worked on architectural elements and some sculptures in his works, but is he specifically known as a sculptor and architect?

The user says "Greek painter, sculptor and architect." Let me double-check El Greco's professions:

- El Greco is most famous as a painter.

- He did design altarpieces and had interests in architecture, but I'm not sure if he's universally known as a sculptor and architect.

Upon second thought, El Greco is primarily a painter. He was involved in the design of his own paintings' frames and altarpieces, which might involve sculptural elements, but is he credited as a sculptor and architect?

Let me think if there's another figure. Is there someone else born in 1541 and died in 1614 who fits?

Another possibility: Perhaps it's a reference to someone like Palladio, but Palladio was an Italian architect born in 1508 and died in 1580, so that doesn't match.

What about Michelangelo? He was born in 1475 and died in 1564, not matching.

Or Leonardo da Vinci: 1452-1519.

No, those don't fit.

Back to El Greco: He is often described as a painter, and sometimes his works include architectural designs, but let's confirm the exact description.

Upon reflection, El Greco is the one who matches the birth and death years. Born 1541, died 1614.

And he is Greek by origin.

As for "painter, sculptor and architect," it might be a bit loose. El Greco is not typically listed as a sculptor, but he did create designs that included sculptural elements.

Perhaps the user means Domenico Theotokopoulos, aka El Greco.

I think it's safe to go with El Greco.

The user specified "Greek painter, sculptor and architect," and in some sources, he is mentioned in that way.

Maybe it's a trick, and it's someone else, but I can't think of anyone else.

Another name: Perhaps it's a reference to the architect Sinan, but he was Ottoman, born around 1489-1490 and died in 1588, not matching.

No, I think El Greco is the correct one.

So, my final answer should be the name: El Greco or Doménikos Theotokópoulos?

The user probably expects the common name, which is El Greco.

The query says: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I need to structure my response accordingly.
