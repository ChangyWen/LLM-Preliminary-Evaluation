*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1360

- Died in 1428

- Known as a 'medieval Russian artist'

I need to recall who this might be. From my knowledge, a famous medieval Russian artist from that era is Andrei Rublev.

Let me verify the dates:

- Andrei Rublev was born around 1360 and died in 1428. That matches.

- He is indeed known as a medieval Russian artist, specifically a painter of icons and frescoes.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? The most prominent figure is Andrei Rublev. He's celebrated for his icon paintings, like the Trinity icon.

The user specified "medieval Russian artist," and Rublev is often called the greatest medieval Russian painter.

The response should be: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I need to structure my answer with the final answer on a new line.

For example:

[Some reasoning or confirmation, if needed]

Final Answer:

Andrei Rublev

The user didn't ask for reasoning; they just want the answer. But in my role, I should provide a clear response.

To make it straightforward, I can say something like: "Based on the details provided, the historical figure is Andrei Rublev."

Then, on a new line, put the final answer.

The instruction is: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, perhaps:

I believe the historical figure you're referring to is Andrei Rublev.

Final Answer:

Andrei Rublev

That seems appropriate.

Is the name spelled correctly? Yes, Andrei Rublev.

Sometimes it's spelled Andrey Rublyov, but the most common English spelling is Andrei Rublev.

I think that's it.
