First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1890, died in 1974, and is described as a 'Russian architect and painter (1890-1974)'.

I need to recall who this might be. From my knowledge, there's a famous Russian artist and architect who fits this description: El Lissitzky.

Let me double-check: El Lissitzky was born in 1890 and died in 1974. Yes, that's correct. He was a Russian artist, designer, typographer, and architect, associated with the Suprematist movement and Constructivism.

Is he primarily known as an architect and painter? He was more of a graphic designer and architect, but he did work in painting and other visual arts. The description matches.

Another figure from that era is Kazimir Malevich, but he was born in 1879 and died in 1935, so that doesn't match.

What about Wassily Kandinsky? He was born in 1866 and died in 1944, not matching.

Ivan Leonidov was an architect, but he was born in 1902 and died in 1959, so no.

Alexey Shchusev was a Russian architect, born in 1873 and died in 1949, not matching.

Perhaps it's Vladimir Tatlin, but he was born in 1885 and died in 1953.

Let me confirm El Lissitzky: Born November 23, 1890, in Pochinok, Russian Empire, and died December 30, 1941. Wait, hold on, I think I have the wrong date for his death.

Upon second thought, El Lissitzky died in 1941, not 1974. That doesn't match.

The user specified died in 1974. So, who is it?

Let me think again. Is there another Russian architect and painter born in 1890 and died in 1974?

Perhaps it's Konstantin Melnikov. He was a Russian architect, born in 1890 and died in 1974. Yes! That sounds right.

Konstantin Melnikov was a prominent Soviet architect, known for his innovative designs, and he also worked in painting or at least was involved in the arts. Is he specifically known as a painter? He was primarily an architect, but the description says "architect and painter," so maybe.

Upon quick mental recall, Melnikov is famous for the Melnikov House and other works, and he was born August 22, 1890, and died November 28, 1974. Perfect match.

Is he known as a painter? He did some graphic work and was involved in the avant-garde, but I'm not entirely sure about painting. However, the description provided is 'Russian architect and painter (1890-1974)', so it must be him.

Another possibility: Igor Stravinsky was a composer, not an architect or painter.

Or perhaps Marc Chagall, but he was born in 1887 and died in 1985.

No, I think Konstantin Melnikov is the one.

So, my final answer should be Konstantin Melnikov.
