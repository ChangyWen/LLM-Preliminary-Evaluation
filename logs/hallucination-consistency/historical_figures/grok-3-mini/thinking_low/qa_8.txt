*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure. The details given are:

- Born in 1840

- Died in 1926

- Known for being a 'French impressionist painter (1840-1926)'

This description matches Claude Monet, who is a famous French impressionist painter.

Let me verify the dates: Claude Monet was indeed born on November 14, 1840, and died on December 5, 1926. That matches perfectly.

The phrase 'French impressionist painter (1840-1926)' is essentially a description that points directly to Monet.

I should ensure there aren't other painters who fit this description. For example:

- Pierre-Auguste Renoir was born in 1841 and died in 1919, so not a match.

- Edgar Degas was born in 1834 and died in 1917.

- Mary Cassatt was born in 1844 and died in 1926, but she was American, not French.

- Berthe Morisot was born in 1841 and died in 1895.

So, Claude Monet is the one who fits all the criteria: French, impressionist, born 1840, died 1926.

The user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I can start with a brief explanation if needed, but since the instruction is to give the final answer in a new line, I'll keep it concise.

Final answer format: Just state the name on a new line.
