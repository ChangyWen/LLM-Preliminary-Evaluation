*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who meets these criteria:

- Born in 1524

- Died in 1580

- Known as a 'Portuguese poet'

I need to recall or know who fits this description. From my knowledge, Luís de Camões is a famous Portuguese poet. Let me verify his dates.

Luís de Camões was born in 1524 and died in 1580. Yes, that's correct. He's best known for his epic poem "Os Lusíadas" (The Lusiads), which is a cornerstone of Portuguese literature.

Is there anyone else who might fit this? Let me think. Another notable Portuguese figure from that era is perhaps explorers like Vasco da Gama, but he's not a poet. Or kings like John III, but again, not a poet.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, Luís de Camões is indeed the one. He was born around 1524 (sources vary slightly, but commonly accepted as 1524) and died on June 10, 1580.

The user specified "known for 'Portuguese poet'", which matches Camões perfectly.

My response needs to be straightforward: provide the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, structure my response:

- I can have a brief explanation if needed, but the instruction is to give the final answer in a new line at the end.

- Final answer should be just the name.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, something like:

[Some response text if necessary]

Final Answer:

[Name]

To keep it simple, I can just state it directly.

Ensure the answer is accurate. Is there any other poet born in 1524 and died in 1580? I don't think so. Camões is the prominent one.

Alright, final answer: Luís de Camões.
