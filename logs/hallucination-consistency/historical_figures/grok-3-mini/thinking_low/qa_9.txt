*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1599, died in 1660, and is known as a 'Spanish painter (1599-1660)'.

I need to recall who that might be. The description matches Diego Velázquez, a famous Spanish painter. Let me verify his dates: He was born in 1599 and died in 1660. Yes, that's correct.

Other famous painters from that era: Rembrandt was Dutch, born in 1606. Caravaggio was Italian and died in 1610. Peter Paul Rubens was Flemish, born in 1577. So, for Spanish painters, Velázquez fits perfectly.

The user specifies "Spanish painter (1599-1660)", which is exactly how Velázquez is often referenced.

My response should end with the final answer on a new line. So, I need to structure it like this: provide any necessary reasoning or confirmation, and then put the answer alone on a new line.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I should have my main response, and then on a new line, just the name.

Final answer: Diego Velázquez.

To be precise, his full name is Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez, but he's commonly known as Diego Velázquez.

I think "Diego Velázquez" is sufficient and accurate.
