First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details:

- Born in 1869

- Died in 1948

- Known for being the 'pre-eminent leader of Indian nationalism during the British Raj (1869-1948)'

The description in quotes is: 'pre-eminent leader of Indian nationalism during the British Raj (1869-1948)'. This seems to be a direct quote or a description that matches a well-known figure.

I know that Mahatma Gandhi was a key leader in Indian nationalism during the British Raj. Let me verify his birth and death years.

- Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869.

- He died on January 30, 1948.

That matches perfectly: born in 1869, died in 1948.

He is indeed known as the pre-eminent leader of Indian nationalism during that period. He led the Indian independence movement through non-violent resistance.

The description says "pre-eminent leader of Indian nationalism during the British Raj (1869-1948)". The dates in parentheses might be referring to the person's lifespan, which aligns with Gandhi's.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let's think:

- Other figures like Jawaharlal Nehru were born in 1889, so not 1869.

- Subhas Chandra Bose was born in 1897.

- Bal Gangadhar Tilak was born in 1856, which doesn't match.

- Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born in 1871, close but not 1869, and he was more associated with the Pakistan movement.

So, Gandhi is the clear match.

The user asks to "give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I need to structure my response accordingly. Probably, end with just the name on a new line.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since it's a straightforward question, I can keep it concise.

Final answer format:

- Respond normally, then on a new line, put the name.
