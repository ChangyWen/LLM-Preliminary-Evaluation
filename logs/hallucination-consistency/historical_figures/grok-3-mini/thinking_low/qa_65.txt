First, the user is asking for a historical figure who was born in 1431, died in 1463, and is known as a 'French poet and criminal'.

I need to recall if I know anyone who fits this description. The years are 1431-1463, which is the 15th century. That sounds like François Villon.

Let me verify: François Villon was a French poet, born around 1431 and died around 1463. He was also involved in criminal activities, like theft and possibly murder, which led to his imprisonment.

Yes, that's correct. He's famous for his poetry, such as "Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis," and he had a notorious life as a criminal.

Is there anyone else who matches this? Let me think. Joan of Arc was born in 1412 and died in 1431, so that's not it. Other French figures from that era don't match the poet and criminal description.

So, François Villon seems to be the right answer.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "Based on the details provided, the historical figure is François Villon."

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
