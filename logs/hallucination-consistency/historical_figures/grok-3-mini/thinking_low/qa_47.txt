*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details: born in 1807, died in 1887, and described as a 'German philosopher, writer and politician (1807-1887)'.

I need to recall who this might be. The description matches Karl Marx. Let me verify:

- Karl Marx was born on May 5, 1818. Wait, that doesn't match. The user said born in 1807.

That can't be right. Let me double-check Karl Marx's birth year. Actually, Karl Marx was born in 1818, not 1807. So, that's not him.

Who was born in 1807 and fits this description? Let me think.

Another famous German philosopher is Hegel, but he was born in 1770 and died in 1831.

What about Friedrich Engels? He was born in 1820.

Perhaps it's Karl Marx, but the user has the wrong year. No, the user specified 1807-1887.

Let me search my knowledge: Is there a German philosopher born in 1807?

Arthur Schopenhauer was born in 1788.

Ludwig Feuerbach was born in 1804, close but not 1807.

Max Stirner was born in 1806, still not 1807.

Perhaps it's Karl Marx, and the user misspoke. But I have to go by the details given.

The description is exactly: 'German philosopher, writer and politician (1807-1887)'. This might be a direct quote or from a source.

Upon second thought, I believe the user might be referring to Karl Marx, but his birth year is 1818. Maybe it's a typo.

Is there someone else? Otto von Bismarck was a German politician, born in 1815.

Perhaps it's not Marx. Let me think of philosophers: SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard was Danish, born in 1813.

Wilhelm von Humboldt was born in 1767.

This is tricky. Maybe it's Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, but no, his dates are wrong.

Perhaps the user means Karl Marx, and the year is incorrect. But I need to answer based on accurate knowledge.

Upon further reflection, I recall that Karl Marx is often listed with those dates in some contexts, but no, that's not right.

Let's double-check online or from memory: No, Karl Marx: 1818-1883. He died in 1883, not 1887.

The user said died in 1887.

Who died in 1887? Friedrich Engels died in 1895.

This is confusing. Let's think: Is there a figure born in 1807 and died in 1887?

After a moment, I remember: It's likely a mistake, but perhaps it's Karl Marx, and the user has the wrong dates.

Perhaps it's not a real person, but that doesn't make sense.

Another idea: Maybe it's David Friedrich Strauss, a German theologian and writer, born in 1808, close to 1807, and died in 1874, not 1887.

Not matching.

Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach was born in 1804 and died in 1872.

Not it.

Perhaps it's Karl August Varnhagen von Ense, but I'm not sure.

This is getting nowhere. Maybe the user means Karl Marx, as he is the most famous German philosopher, writer, and politician from that era, even if the dates are off.

But the user specified the dates, so I should point that out, but the instruction is to give the final answer.

The description is in quotes: 'German philosopher, writer and politician (1807-1887)'. This might be from a specific source that has the wrong dates.

Upon second thought, I believe the person is Karl Marx, and perhaps the user has the dates wrong from memory.

In some biographies, dates might be misremembered.

But to be accurate, Karl Marx was born in 1818 and died in 1883.

However, there's no major figure with exactly 1807-1887 that fits.

Wait, let's think of politicians: Otto von Bismarck was born in 1815 and died in 1898.

Not it.

Perhaps it's Wilhelm I of Germany, born in 1797, died in 1888.

Close, but not exact.

This is puzzling. Maybe it's a less known figure, but the description sounds like Marx.

Upon further reflection, I recall that some people might confuse with other figures, but I think the intended answer is Karl Marx.

Perhaps it's Friedrich Nietzsche, but he was born in 1844.

No.

Another one: Heinrich Heine, German writer, born in 1797, died in 1856.

Not it.

Perhaps the user means Karl Marx, and I should go with that.

Maybe it's a typo, and it's 1818-1883.

Since the user asked for the name based on that description, and in common knowledge, it's Karl Marx, I'll go with that.

So, my final answer will be Karl Marx.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
It appears there might be a discrepancy in the dates you provided, as the description closely matches Karl Marx, who was actually born in 1818 and died in 1883. He was a prominent German philosopher, writer, and politician known for his works on economics, socialism, and communism. However, based on the details you specified, no exact match exists for a figure born in 1807 and died in 1887.

If this is referring to Karl Marx despite the date error, I'll provide that as the answer.

Karl Marx
