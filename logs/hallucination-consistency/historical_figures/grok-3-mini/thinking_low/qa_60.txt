First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1888

- Died in 1946

- Known for being a Chilean politician and President (1888-1946)

The description says "President (1888-1946)", which might be a bit confusing. It could mean the person was president from 1888 to 1946, but that doesn't make sense because no one was president for that long. Looking closely, it's probably meant to be the person's lifespan, like born 1888, died 1946, and was a Chilean politician and President.

In the query, it's phrased as: "known for 'Chilean politician and President (1888-1946)'". The (1888-1946) likely refers to the person's birth and death years, not their term as president.

I need to recall who this is. From my knowledge, Arturo Alessandri Palma was a Chilean president. Let me verify his dates.

Arturo Alessandri was born in 1868, not 1888. That doesn't match.

Perhaps it's Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. Let me think.

The one that fits is Arturo Alessandri, but his birth year is wrong. No, let me double-check.

Upon second thought, I believe it's Juan Esteban Montero, but let's think carefully.

The most famous Chilean president around that era is Arturo Alessandri, born 1868, president in the 1920s.

That doesn't match. The query says born in 1888.

Let me search my knowledge: Who was born in 1888 and died in 1946 and was a Chilean president?

I think it's Arturo Alessandri's son, but no.

Perhaps Gabriel González Videla, but his dates are later.

Let's think: Eduardo Frei Montalva was later.

Perhaps it's not a president. The query specifies "Chilean politician and President".

Another one: Carlos Ibáñez del Campo was born in 1877 and died in 1960, so not that.

Perhaps I have it wrong. Let me recall: Is there a president born in 1888?

Upon thinking, I believe it's Arturo Alessandri, but his birth year is 1868. Maybe the query has a typo, or perhaps it's someone else.

The query says: "born in 1888, died in 1946, and is known for 'Chilean politician and President (1888-1946)'"

Perhaps it's Pedro Aguirre Cerda, who was president from 1938 to 1941, and he died in 1941, not 1946.

This is tricky. Let me think of Juan Antonio Ríos, who was president from 1942 to 1946, and he died in 1946. When was he born? I think in 1888.

Yes! Juan Antonio Ríos Morales was born on April 9, 1888, and died on June 27, 1946. He was the President of Chile from 1942 until his death in 1946.

That matches perfectly: born 1888, died 1946, Chilean politician and President.

So, the historical figure is Juan Antonio Ríos.

I need to confirm if that's accurate. Yes, upon double-checking my knowledge, that's correct.

Therefore, the final answer is Juan Antonio Ríos.
