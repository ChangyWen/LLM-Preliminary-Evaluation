*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who:

- Was born in 1952

- Died in 2001

- Is known as an 'English writer and humorist'

I need to recall or know who fits this description. The key details are the birth and death years, and the profession.

Thinking about famous English writers and humorists born in 1952 and died in 2001:

- Douglas Adams comes to mind. He was an English writer, famous for "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," which is humorous.

- Let me verify his birth and death years. Douglas Adams was born on March 11, 1952, and he died on May 11, 2001. That matches perfectly.

Is there anyone else who fits this? 

- P.G. Wodehouse was a humorist, but he was born in 1881 and died in 1975, so not him.

- Terry Pratchett was a humorist, born in 1948 and died in 2015, so no.

- John Cleese is a humorist, but he's still alive, born in 1939.

- So, Douglas Adams seems to be the correct match.

The user specified "English writer and humorist," and Douglas Adams is indeed English and fits the bill.

My response should end with the final answer on a new line.

Structure my response:

- I don't need to provide a lot of explanation in the response, as per the user's request. They said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

- So, I can have a brief response and then the answer.

Final answer format: Put it on a new line at the end.

For example:

[Some response text]

Final Answer:

Douglas Adams

Make sure it's accurate.
