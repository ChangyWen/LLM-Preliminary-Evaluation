First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1872

- Died in 1928

- Known for: 'Norwegian explorer; first person to reach the South Pole'

I need to recall who this is. I know that Roald Amundsen was a famous Norwegian explorer. He was the first person to reach the South Pole.

Let me verify the dates:

- Roald Amundsen was born on July 16, 1872.

- He died on June 18, 1928.

That matches perfectly.

He is indeed known for being the first to reach the South Pole in 1911.

So, the historical figure is Roald Amundsen.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward question, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer format: Put it on a new line at the end. So, something like:

[My response text]

Final Answer:

Roald Amundsen

That should work.
