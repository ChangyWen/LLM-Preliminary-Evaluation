First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1898

- Died in 1980

- Known for being a 'Chilean politician (1898-1980)'

I need to recall or know who this refers to. From my knowledge, a prominent Chilean politician born in 1898 and died in 1980 is Salvador Allende.

Let me verify the dates: Salvador Allende was indeed born on July 26, 1908, and died on September 11, 1973. Wait, that doesn't match. He was born in 1908, not 1898.

That's a problem. The user said born in 1898. Is there another Chilean politician who fits this?

Let me think again. Perhaps it's Arturo Alessandri. Arturo Alessandri Palma was a Chilean president. He was born on December 20, 1868, and died on March 24, 1950. That doesn't match either.

Maybe Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. He was a Chilean president. Born on November 3, 1877, and died on April 28, 1960. Still not 1898.

Who was born in 1898? Let me rack my brain. Eduardo Frei Montalva was a Chilean president. He was born on January 16, 1911, and died on January 22, 1982. Not matching.

Perhaps Gabriel González Videla. He was born on November 22, 1898, and died on August 22, 1980. That matches perfectly!

Let me confirm: Gabriel González Videla was a Chilean politician, served as President of Chile from 1946 to 1952. Born in 1898, died in 1980.

Yes, that seems correct. The description "Chilean politician (1898-1980)" likely refers to him.

So, the historical figure is Gabriel González Videla.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

My response should be straightforward, and end with the name on a new line.
