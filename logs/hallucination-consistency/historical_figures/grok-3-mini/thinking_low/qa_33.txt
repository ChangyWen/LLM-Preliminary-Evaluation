*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for a historical figure who was born in 1840, died in 1902, and is known as a 'French writer'. I need to identify who that is.

Recall famous French writers. One that comes to mind is Émile Zola. Let me check his birth and death years. Émile Zola was born on April 2, 1840, and died on September 29, 1902. That matches perfectly.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Another famous French writer born around that time is Guy de Maupassant, but he was born in 1850 and died in 1893, which doesn't match.

Jules Verne was born in 1828 and died in 1905, so not a match.

Victor Hugo was born in 1802 and died in 1885, way off.

Gustave Flaubert was born in 1821 and died in 1880.

Anatole France was born in 1844 and died in 1924, close but not exact.

So, Émile Zola seems to be the exact match: born 1840, died 1902, and definitely a prominent French writer known for his novels, especially in the naturalist movement.

The user specified "known for 'French writer'", which might be a bit vague, but it's clear they mean a French writer.

My response should end with the final answer on a new line.

Structure my response: I should keep it straightforward, perhaps just state the answer at the end as instructed.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I can have a brief response and then the answer on a new line.

Final answer: Émile Zola.
