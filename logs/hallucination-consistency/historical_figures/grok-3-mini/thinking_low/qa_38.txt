First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details: born in 1807, died in 1882, and described as 'Italian general, patriot and republican (1807-1882)'.

I need to recall who this might be. From my knowledge, Giuseppe Garibaldi fits this description perfectly. He was an Italian general, patriot, and republican who played a key role in the unification of Italy.

Let me verify the dates: Giuseppe Garibaldi was born on July 4, 1807, and died on June 2, 1882. That matches exactly.

The description "Italian general, patriot and republican" is spot on for Garibaldi. He led the Expedition of the Thousand and was a prominent figure in the Risorgimento, the movement for Italian unification.

I don't think there's another prominent figure with these exact dates and description. For example, Charles Darwin was born in 1809 and died in 1882, but he's not Italian or a general. Karl Marx was born in 1818 and died in 1883, so that doesn't match.

So, I'm confident it's Giuseppe Garibaldi.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, but since they asked for the final answer in a new line, I'll keep it concise.

Final answer: Giuseppe Garibaldi
