*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details: born in 1707, died in 1778, and described as a 'Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist (1707-1778)'.

I need to recall who this refers to. From my knowledge, this sounds like Carl Linnaeus. Let me double-check:

- Carl Linnaeus was a Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist.

- He was born on May 23, 1707.

- He died on January 10, 1778.

That matches perfectly.

The description in the query is exactly how he's often referenced in historical contexts.

So, the answer should be Carl Linnaeus.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward question, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final response structure:

- Perhaps a brief confirmation or reasoning, but the user didn't specify.

- End with the answer on a new line.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, something like:

[Optional brief response]

Final Answer:

Carl Linnaeus

That should work.
