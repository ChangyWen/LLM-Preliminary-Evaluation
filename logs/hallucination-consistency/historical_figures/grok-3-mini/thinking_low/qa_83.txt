*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details:

- Born in 1879

- Died in 1955

- Known as 'German-born theoretical physicist; developer of the theory of relativity (1879–1955)'

This description matches Albert Einstein perfectly. Let me verify the facts:

- Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879.

- He died on April 18, 1955.

- He was a German-born theoretical physicist.

- He is most famous for developing the theory of relativity.

The description in quotes is essentially a biographical snippet that points directly to Einstein.

The user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is straightforward, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.

Response structure:

- I can start with a brief confirmation or just go straight to the answer.

- End with the answer on a new line.

For example:

"The historical figure described is Albert Einstein.

Albert Einstein"

To make it precise:

After reasoning, put the final answer as requested.
