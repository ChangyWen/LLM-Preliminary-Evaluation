*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1935

- Died in 1977

- Known for being an 'American singer and actor (1935–1977)'

The description in quotes is 'American singer and actor (1935–1977)', which matches the birth and death years.

I need to think of famous American singers and actors who were born in 1935 and died in 1977.

Who fits this? Elvis Presley was born in 1935 and died in 1977. Let me double-check:

- Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935.

- He died on August 16, 1977.

Yes, that matches perfectly. He was an iconic American singer and actor.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think:

- Other famous people born in 1935: Woody Allen (born 1935, still alive), Jim Morrison (born 1943), etc. No, Jim Morrison was born in 1943.

- Someone who died in 1977: Elvis is the most prominent. Maria Callas died in 1977, but she was Greek-American, and more of an opera singer, not typically described as an "American singer and actor."

- Elvis is specifically known as an American singer and actor, with films like "Love Me Tender."

The description says 'American singer and actor (1935–1977)', which seems like it's directly from a source like Wikipedia or an encyclopedia, where Elvis Presley's page might have that bio.

So, I believe Elvis Presley is the correct answer.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. Since the query is straightforward, I don't need to add extra information unless necessary.

Final answer: Elvis Presley
