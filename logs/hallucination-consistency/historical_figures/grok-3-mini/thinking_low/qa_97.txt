*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1265, died in 1321, and is known for being an "Italian poet (1265–1321)".

I need to recall who that is. The description matches Dante Alighieri. He is famously known as an Italian poet, and his birth and death years are indeed 1265 to 1321. He's the author of the Divine Comedy.

Let me double-check: Dante was born in Florence in 1265 and died in 1321. Yes, that's correct.

The user specifies to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since it's a straightforward question, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.

So, something like:

After reasoning, the historical figure is Dante Alighieri.

Then, on a new line: Dante Alighieri

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

I should have my response text, and then the final answer on a new line.

For example:

The historical figure who matches the description is Dante Alighieri.

Final answer:

Dante Alighieri

That seems appropriate.

Is there any other figure who fits this description? I don't think so. Dante is the most prominent Italian poet from that exact period.

Alright, let's outline the response:

1. Acknowledge the query briefly.

2. State the answer.

3. End with the final answer on a new line.
