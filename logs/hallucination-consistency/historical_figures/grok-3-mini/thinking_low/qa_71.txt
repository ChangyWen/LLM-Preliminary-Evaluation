*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details:

- Born in -384 (which I interpret as 384 BC, since negative years often denote BC in historical contexts).

- Died in -322 (which would be 322 BC).

- Known for being an 'ancient Greek philosopher'.

I need to recall who fits this description. The most famous ancient Greek philosopher born around 384 BC and died around 322 BC is Aristotle.

Let me verify:

- Aristotle was born in 384 BC in Stagira, Greece.

- He died in 322 BC in Chalcis, Greece.

- He is indeed one of the most prominent ancient Greek philosophers, known for his works in logic, metaphysics, ethics, and more.

Other ancient Greek philosophers like Socrates (born around 470 BC, died 399 BC) or Plato (born around 427 BC, died 348 BC) don't match the dates.

So, Aristotle is the correct answer.

The user specifies: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

I should structure my response accordingly. My response should end with the answer on a new line.

For example:

[Some response text if needed]

Final answer:

Aristotle

The user didn't ask for any explanation in the response, but since this is an AI interaction, it's fine to have a brief confirmation if I want, but I'll keep it concise.

Finally, put the answer in a new line at the end.
