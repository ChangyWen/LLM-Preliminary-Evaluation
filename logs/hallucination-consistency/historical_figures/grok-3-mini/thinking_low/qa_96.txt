*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1785, died in 1873, and is described as an "Italian poet and novelist (1785-1873)."

I need to recall who this might be. The description matches Alessandro Manzoni, an Italian poet and novelist. Let me verify his dates: He was born in 1785 and died in 1873. Yes, that's correct.

Alessandro Manzoni is famous for his novel "The Betrothed" (I Promessi Sposi), which is a cornerstone of Italian literature. He is indeed an Italian poet and novelist.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think. Another famous figure born in 1785 is Arthur Schopenhauer, but he's German, not Italian, and a philosopher, not primarily a poet or novelist. So, no.

The description specifically says "Italian poet and novelist," so it has to be Manzoni.

The user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since the query is straightforward, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer: Alessandro Manzoni.
