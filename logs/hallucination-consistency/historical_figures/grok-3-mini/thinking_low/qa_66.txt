*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details:

- Born in 1932

- Died in 1986

- Known for being a 'Soviet and Russian filmmaker, writer, film editor, film theorist, and theatre and opera director'

I need to recall or know who this person is. From my knowledge, this description matches Andrei Tarkovsky.

Let me verify the details:

- Andrei Tarkovsky was born on April 4, 1932.

- He died on December 29, 1986.

- He was a Soviet filmmaker, known for films like "Solaris" and "Stalker." He was also involved in writing, film editing, film theory, and directed in theatre and opera.

That seems correct. He was indeed a prominent figure in Soviet and Russian cinema.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think:

- Other famous filmmakers from that era: Sergei Eisenstein was earlier (1898-1948), so not him.

- Ingmar Bergman was Swedish, born 1918, died 2007.

- Akira Kurosawa was Japanese, born 1910, died 1998.

No one else immediately comes to mind who matches the birth and death years and the exact description.

The description specifies "Soviet and Russian," which aligns with Tarkovsky, as he was born in the Soviet Union and is considered a key figure in Russian cinema.

The user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be straightforward: perhaps a brief confirmation and then the answer.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
