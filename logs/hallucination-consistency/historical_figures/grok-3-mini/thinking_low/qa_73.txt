First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1867

- Died in 1935

- Known for being a Polish politician, First Marshall, and Prime Minister

The description is: 'Polish politician, First Marshall and Prime Minister (1867-1935)'

I need to identify who this refers to. From my knowledge, this sounds like Józef Piłsudski.

Let me verify the details:

- Józef Piłsudski was born on December 5, 1867.

- He died on May 12, 1935.

- He was a Polish statesman, military leader, and politician. He is often referred to as the First Marshal of Poland.

- He served as the Chief of State (1918–1922) and was the de facto leader of Poland. He did hold the position of Prime Minister twice: from 1918 to 1919 and briefly in 1926-1928, but he's more famously known for his military and political roles.

The title "First Marshall" likely means "First Marshal," which is a title he held: Marszałek Polski (Marshal of Poland).

So, yes, this matches Józef Piłsudski.

I should ensure there isn't another figure who fits this description. Other Polish figures from that era include Roman Dmowski or Ignacy Paderewski, but they don't match the birth and death dates or the specific titles.

- Roman Dmowski: Born 1864, died 1939. Not a match.

- Ignacy Paderewski: Born 1860, died 1941. Prime Minister in 1919, but not First Marshal.

So, Piłsudski is the correct one.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward query, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Final answer: Józef Piłsudski
