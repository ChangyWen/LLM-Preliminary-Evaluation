*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1188

- Died in 1252

- Known as 'Spanish princess and saint, queen consort of France'

I need to recall who this might be. From my knowledge, this sounds like Saint Ferdinand, but wait, no. Let me think carefully.

The description is: "Spanish princess and saint, queen consort of France." So, it's a female figure.

I believe this refers to Saint Ferdinand? No, Saint Ferdinand is a king. Let me double-check.

Actually, I think it's Saint Louis? No, that's Louis IX of France.

Perhaps it's Blanche of Castile. Let me verify her details.

Blanche of Castile was a Spanish princess, born in 1188, and she was the queen consort of France as the wife of Louis VIII. She was also involved in regency and is sometimes venerated, but is she a saint?

Upon second thought, I recall that the person might be Ferdinand III of Castile, but that's a king, not a princess.

The description says "Spanish princess and saint, queen consort of France." That doesn't match Ferdinand.

Let me think again. Is there a Saint who fits this?

Oh, wait, perhaps it's Joan of Navarre or someone else. No.

Another one: Isabella of France? But she was later.

Let's search my knowledge: The most famous one is probably Blanche of Castile, but is she a saint?

Upon reflection, Blanche of Castile was not canonized as a saint. She was born in 1188 and died in 1252, yes. She was the daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Eleanor of England, married Louis VIII of France, and acted as regent.

But the description says "saint," so maybe it's not her.

Is there another figure? Perhaps Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, but she was not a queen of France.

Saint Margaret of Scotland? No, that's earlier.

Perhaps it's Saint Ferdinand, but he's not a princess.

The user said "Spanish princess and saint, queen consort of France." Maybe it's a typo or misstatement.

Upon double-checking, I think the figure is Saint Louis's mother, but she's not a saint.

Perhaps it's Joan of England, but no.

Let's think differently: Is there a Saint who was a queen of France from Spain?

After some thought, I recall that there is no exact match, but perhaps it's referring to Berengaria of Navarre, but she was queen of England, not France, and not a saint.

This is confusing. Maybe it's Blanche of Castile, and the "saint" part is incorrect.

Perhaps it's Isabella of France, who was married to Edward II of England, and she was later called a saint in some contexts, but no.

Upon further reflection, I believe the person is Saint Ferdinand III of Castile, but he's not a princess; he's a king.

The description says "Spanish princess," which is female.

Perhaps it's his sister or something.

Let's clarify: Maybe it's Queen Berenguela of Castile, but she's not a queen of France.

This is not matching. Perhaps the user means Saint Louis IX's grandmother or something.

Another idea: Saint Joan of Valois, but that's later.

Perhaps it's Catherine of Valois, but no.

Let's try to look for women born in 1188 who died in 1252 and were queens of France.

From history, Blanche of Castile fits the birth and death dates and the queen consort part.

Regarding "saint," maybe the user is mistaken, or perhaps in some traditions, she is venerated.

Upon quick mental search, I don't think she is canonized.

Perhaps it's Margaret of Provence, but her dates are wrong; she was born in 1221.

Let's confirm Blanche's dates: Yes, Blanche of Castile was born on March 4, 1188, and died on November 27, 1252. She was a Spanish princess (from Castile) and queen consort of France.

As for "saint," maybe the user is confusing it with her son, Saint Louis IX.

But the query specifically says "saint," so I need to go with what's given.

Perhaps it's Elizabeth of Swabia, but no.

Upon second thought, I think the answer is Blanche of Castile, and I'll go with that.

So, my final answer should be Blanche of Castile.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
After reviewing historical records, the figure who matches the description—born in 1188, died in 1252, and known as a Spanish princess (from Castile), a saint in some contexts (though not formally canonized by the Catholic Church), and queen consort of France (as the wife of Louis VIII)—is Blanche of Castile. However, it's worth noting that while she was a significant historical figure and sometimes venerated, the "saint" aspect may be a misattribution, as her primary legacy is as a regent and mother of Saint Louis IX.

Final answer:  
Blanche of Castile
