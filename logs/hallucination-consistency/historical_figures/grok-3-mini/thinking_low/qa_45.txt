First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these specific details:

- Born in 1899

- Died in 1943

- Known for being a 'French resistance fighter and civil servant'

I need to recall or know who fits this description. Let me think about famous French resistance fighters from World War II.

One name that comes to mind is Jean Moulin. Let me verify his details:

- Jean Moulin was born on June 20, 1899.

- He died on July 8, 1943.

- He was a key figure in the French Resistance during World War II. He was also a civil servant before the war; he served as a prefect in the French government.

That matches perfectly: born in 1899, died in 1943, and known as a French resistance fighter and civil servant.

Is there anyone else who fits this? Let me double-check. Another prominent figure is Charles de Gaulle, but he was born in 1890 and died in 1970, so that doesn't match.

What about others like Philippe Leclerc or others in the resistance? Leclerc was born in 1902 and died in 1947. Not a match.

Or Simone Weil, but she was born in 1909 and died in 1943, and while she was involved in some resistance activities, she wasn't primarily known as a resistance fighter; she was a philosopher.

No, Jean Moulin seems to be the exact match.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward query, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.
