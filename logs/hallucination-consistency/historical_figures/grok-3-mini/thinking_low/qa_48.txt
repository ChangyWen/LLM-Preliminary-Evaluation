First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1775

- Died in 1836

- Known as a 'French physicist and mathematician'

I need to recall who that might be. The description sounds like André-Marie Ampère. Let me verify his details.

André-Marie Ampère was indeed a French physicist and mathematician. He was born on January 20, 1775, and died on June 10, 1836. That matches perfectly.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think. Another famous French scientist is Joseph Fourier, but he was born in 1768 and died in 1830, which doesn't match.

Or Augustin-Jean Fresnel, born in 1788, died in 1827 – not a match.

Charles-Augustin de Coulomb was born in 1736 and died in 1806 – way off.

So, Ampère seems to be the correct one.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward query, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.
