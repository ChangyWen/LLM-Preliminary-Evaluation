First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in -427 (which I interpret as 427 BC, since negative years often denote BC in historical contexts).

- Died in -347 (which would be 347 BC).

- Known for being an 'ancient Greek philosopher'.

I need to recall who fits this description. The most famous ancient Greek philosopher born around 427 BC and died around 347 BC is Plato.

Let me verify:

- Plato was born in 427 or 428 BC.

- He died in 348 or 347 BC.

Yes, that matches closely. Plato is indeed one of the most prominent ancient Greek philosophers.

Other philosophers like Socrates (born around 470 BC, died 399 BC) don't match the dates. Aristotle was born in 384 BC and died in 322 BC, which is later.

So, Plato is the correct figure.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can briefly confirm the details, but since the instruction is to put the final answer on a new line, I'll keep it concise.

Final answer: Plato
