*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1822

- Died in 1895

- Known as a 'French chemist and microbiologist'

I need to recall who that might be. From my knowledge, Louis Pasteur fits this description perfectly.

Let me verify:

- Louis Pasteur was born on December 27, 1822.

- He died on September 28, 1895.

- He was a French chemist and microbiologist, famous for his work in pasteurization, vaccines, and germ theory.

That matches exactly.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since the query is straightforward, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.

So, something like:

After considering the details, the historical figure is Louis Pasteur.

Then, on a new line: Louis Pasteur

To make it precise, I'll end with the name on a new line.
