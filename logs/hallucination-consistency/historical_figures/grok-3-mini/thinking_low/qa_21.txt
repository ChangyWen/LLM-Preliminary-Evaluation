First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these specific details:

- Born in 1949

- Died in 2002

- Known for being an American pornographic actress and later an anti-porn activist

I need to recall who this might be. From my knowledge, Linda Lovelace comes to mind. Let me verify her details.

Linda Lovelace was indeed an American pornographic actress, famous for the film "Deep Throat" in the 1970s. Later in her life, she became an anti-pornography activist, speaking out against the industry and claiming she was coerced into performing.

Now, confirm her birth and death years:

- Born: Linda Susan Boreman on January 10, 1949

- Died: April 22, 2002, from injuries sustained in a car accident.

That matches perfectly.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? I don't think so. Linda Lovelace is the most prominent figure with this exact background.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward query, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.
