*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in -69 (which I interpret as 69 BC)

- Died in -30 (which I interpret as 30 BC)

- Known for being the 'last active pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt'

I need to recall who this refers to. Ptolemaic Egypt was the last dynasty of ancient Egypt, ruled by the Ptolemies, who were of Greek origin.

The last pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt was Cleopatra VII. Let me verify her dates:

- Cleopatra VII was born in 69 BC.

- She died in 30 BC.

That matches: born in -69 (69 BC) and died in -30 (30 BC).

She is indeed known as the last active pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt. After her death, Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire.

So, the historical figure is Cleopatra.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can briefly confirm the details, but since the instruction is to put the final answer on a new line, I'll keep it concise.

Final answer: Cleopatra

To be precise, her full name is Cleopatra VII Philopator, but commonly she's just referred to as Cleopatra.

I think "Cleopatra" is sufficient, as it's the most recognizable name.
