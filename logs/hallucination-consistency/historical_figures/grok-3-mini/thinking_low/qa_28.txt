*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1911, died in 1982, and is known for being the President of Chile during that period. The phrasing is "President of Chile (1911-1982)", which might mean the person was president from 1911 to 1982, but that doesn't make sense because no one could be president for that long.

Let me clarify: the user says "known for 'President of Chile (1911-1982)'". This could be a description where (1911-1982) refers to the person's lifespan, not their term. In biographies, it's common to see "Person (birth year-death year)".

So, the figure was born in 1911, died in 1982, and was President of Chile at some point.

Who is that? I know of Salvador Allende. Let me verify his details.

Salvador Allende was a Chilean politician and physician who served as President of Chile from 1970 until his death in 1973. But he died in 1973, not 1982. That doesn't match.

The user says died in 1982. Allende died in 1973. So, that's not him.

Another famous Chilean president: Augusto Pinochet. He was born in 1915 and died in 2006. That doesn't match the birth and death years.

Born in 1911... Let me think. Is there someone else?

Perhaps it's Eduardo Frei Montalva. He was President of Chile from 1964 to 1970. When was he born and died? I think he was born in 1911 and died in 1982.

Yes! Eduardo Frei Montalva was born on January 16, 1911, and died on January 22, 1982. He served as President of Chile from 1964 to 1970.

That matches: born 1911, died 1982, and known for being President of Chile.

Is there anyone else? Let me double-check. Another possibility: Arturo Alessandri was President earlier, but he was born in 1868 and died in 1950. No.

Or Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, born 1877, died 1960. Not matching.

So, Eduardo Frei Montalva seems to be the one.

The user said "President of Chile (1911-1982)", which might be interpreted as his term, but that can't be. It's likely just the way it's phrased.

Perhaps it's a typo or misphrasing, but based on the facts, Eduardo Frei Montalva fits.

My final answer should be his name, and I need to put it in a new line at the end of my response.
