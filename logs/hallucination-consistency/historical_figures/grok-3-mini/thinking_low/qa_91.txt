*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1800

- Died in 1849

- Known as the 'Slovene national poet, a Carniolan Romantic poet of Slovene descent'

I need to recall who this might be. From my knowledge, this sounds like France Prešeren. Let me verify:

- France Prešeren was born on December 3, 1800.

- He died on February 8, 1849.

- He is indeed considered the national poet of Slovenia. He was a Romantic poet from Carniola, which is a historical region in Slovenia.

That matches perfectly.

Now, the user wants me to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly. Probably, I can have a brief explanation and then the answer on a new line.

Response structure:

- Start with a confirmation or a brief statement.

- End with the answer on a new line.

Finally, ensure the answer is just the name, as specified.

So, my final answer will be: France Prešeren
