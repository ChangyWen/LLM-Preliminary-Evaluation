*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details:

- Born in 1889

- Died in 1945

- Known as 'Austrian-born German politician, chancellor and F端hrer of Germany, leader of the Nazi Party (1889-1945)'

This description matches Adolf Hitler perfectly. Let me verify the facts:

- Adolf Hitler was born on April 20, 1889, in Braunau am Inn, Austria-Hungary.

- He died on April 30, 1945, in Berlin, Germany.

- He was an Austrian-born German politician who became the leader of the Nazi Party, Chancellor of Germany in 1933, and F端hrer in 1934.

The description in quotes is essentially a biography snippet that directly points to Hitler.

The user wants me to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful, truthful, and not promote any harmful ideologies. I'll stick to factual information.

Final answer format: End with the name on a new line.

Possible response structure:

- I can start with a brief confirmation or direct answer.

- Then, end with the name as specified.

For example:

"I believe the historical figure you're referring to is Adolf Hitler, based on the details provided."

Followed by the final answer on a new line.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, something like:
