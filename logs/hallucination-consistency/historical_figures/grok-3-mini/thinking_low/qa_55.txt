First, the user is asking for a historical figure who was born in 1844, died in 1896, and is known as a 'French poet'. I need to recall who that might be.

I know of several French poets. One that comes to mind is Arthur Rimbaud. Let me verify his dates. Arthur Rimbaud was born in 1854, not 1844. That doesn't match.

Another famous French poet is Paul Verlaine. Let me check his dates. Paul Verlaine was born in 1844 and died in 1896. That sounds right.

Confirming: Paul Verlaine was indeed born on March 30, 1844, and died on January 8, 1896. He's a prominent French poet, associated with the Symbolist movement.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Stéphane Mallarmé was born in 1842 and died in 1898, so not a match. Charles Baudelaire was born in 1821 and died in 1867, too early. Victor Hugo was born in 1802 and died in 1885, not matching.

So, Paul Verlaine seems to be the correct answer.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since the query is straightforward, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer: Paul Verlaine.
