*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1821, died in 1881, and is known as a 'Russian author'.

I need to recall who that might be. The most famous Russian author born in 1821 and died in 1881 is Fyodor Dostoevsky. Let me double-check his dates.

Fyodor Dostoevsky was born on November 11, 1821, and died on February 9, 1881. That matches perfectly.

Is there any other Russian author with those exact birth and death years? Leo Tolstoy was born in 1828 and died in 1910, so that's not it. Anton Chekhov was born in 1860 and died in 1904. Ivan Turgenev was born in 1818 and died in 1883, which is close but not exact.

So, Dostoevsky is the one who fits the description exactly.

The user specified "known for 'Russian author'", which is in quotes, but I think that's just emphasizing the category. It's clear they mean a Russian author.

My response should end with the final answer on a new line. So, I need to structure it like this: provide any necessary reasoning or confirmation, and then put the answer alone on a new line at the end.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, for example:

[Some response text]

Final answer: Fyodor Dostoevsky

Make sure it's just the name, as that's what they asked for.

Is there any chance it could be someone else? Nikolai Gogol was born in 1809 and died in 1852. Alexander Pushkin was born in 1799 and died in 1837. So, no, Dostoevsky is the correct one.

Alright, I'm confident.
