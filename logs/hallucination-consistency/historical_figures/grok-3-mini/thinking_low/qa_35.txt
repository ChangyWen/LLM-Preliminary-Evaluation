*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details: born in 1769, died in 1821, and known as 'French general and emperor (1769-1821)'.

I need to recall who this refers to. The description matches Napoleon Bonaparte perfectly. He was a French military leader and emperor, born on August 15, 1769, and died on May 5, 1821.

Let me double-check the dates: Yes, Napoleon was born in 1769 in Corsica and died in 1821 on Saint Helena.

The phrase 'French general and emperor (1769-1821)' is essentially a description that points directly to Napoleon.

My response should be straightforward. The user asks to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, structure my response:

- I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation if needed, but since the instruction is to keep it clear, I'll be concise.

- End with the final answer on a new line.

Final answer: Napoleon Bonaparte.

Is there any other figure that fits this description? I don't think so. Napoleon is the most famous one with those exact dates and titles.

Make sure the response is accurate and directly answers the question.
