*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1564

- Died in 1642

- Known as an 'Italian mathematician, physicist, philosopher and astronomer'

I need to recall who this person is. From my knowledge, that sounds exactly like Galileo Galilei.

Let me verify the facts:

- Galileo Galilei was born on February 15, 1564.

- He died on January 8, 1642.

- He was indeed an Italian scientist, known for his work in mathematics, physics, philosophy, and astronomy. He's famous for his improvements to the telescope, observations of the heavens, and his support for the Copernican system.

The description matches perfectly.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since the query is straightforward, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.

So, something like:

After reasoning, the historical figure is Galileo Galilei.

Then, on a new line: Galileo Galilei

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

I should have my response text, and then the answer on a new line.

For example:

"I believe the historical figure you're referring to is Galileo Galilei, who matches all the details you provided."

Then, on a new line: Galileo Galilei

To make it clear, I'll keep it simple.
