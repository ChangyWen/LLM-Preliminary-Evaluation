*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details: born in 1473, died in 1543, and described as a Renaissance-era mathematician, astronomer, and clergyman who formulated the heliocentric model of the Universe.

I need to recall who this refers to. The heliocentric model is the idea that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun, which was a revolutionary concept in astronomy.

The person who is most famous for this is Nicolaus Copernicus. Let me verify the details:

- Born: 1473

- Died: 1543

- He was a mathematician, astronomer, and indeed a clergyman (he was a canon in the Catholic Church).

- He formulated the heliocentric model in his book "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium," published in 1543.

That matches perfectly.

Now, the user instructs to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly. I can provide a brief confirmation or explanation, and then end with the name on a new line.

For example:

After verifying the details, the historical figure is Nicolaus Copernicus.

Final answer:

Nicolaus Copernicus

I should ensure that my response is accurate and not verbose. The user didn't ask for additional information, so I'll keep it straightforward.

Is there any other figure that might fit this description? Let's think: Galileo promoted the heliocentric model but was born in 1564 and died in 1642. Tycho Brahe was an astronomer but not the one who formulated the heliocentric model. Kepler built on Copernicus's work but wasn't the originator. So, no, Copernicus is definitely the correct one.

Alright, finalizing my response.
