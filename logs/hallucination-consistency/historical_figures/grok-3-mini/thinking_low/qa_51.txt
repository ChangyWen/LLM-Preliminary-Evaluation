First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1564

- Died in 1616

- Known for being an English playwright and poet

I know that William Shakespeare fits this description perfectly. He was born in 1564 and died in 1616, and he's famously known as an English playwright and poet.

Let me double-check the dates: Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, and his birthday is traditionally celebrated on April 23, 1564. He died on April 23, 1616. So, that matches.

Is there anyone else who might fit this? Probably not, as these dates are very specific to Shakespeare. Other famous figures like Christopher Marlowe (born 1564, died 1593) don't match the death year. Ben Jonson was born in 1572, so no.

The user specifies to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.

For example:

"I believe the historical figure you're referring to is William Shakespeare, who is indeed renowned as an English playwright and poet with those exact birth and death years."

Then, on a new line: "William Shakespeare"

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, something like:

[Some response text]

Final answer:

William Shakespeare

That makes sense.

Ensure the response is accurate and not verbose. Keep it concise.
