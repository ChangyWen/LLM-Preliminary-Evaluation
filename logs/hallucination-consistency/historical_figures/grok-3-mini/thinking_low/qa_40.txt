*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure. The details given are:

- Born in 1719

- Died in 1786

- Known as 'French horticulturalist (1719-1786)'

I need to recall or know who this refers to. From my knowledge, a famous French horticulturalist from that era is André Le Nôtre, but let me double-check the dates.

André Le Nôtre was born in 1613 and died in 1700, so that's not him.

Another one is Antoine-Joseph Pernetty, but I'm not sure.

The description is specifically 'French horticulturalist (1719-1786)'. This sounds like it might be from a list or a reference, perhaps from Wikipedia or a biographical database.

I believe it's Philippe de Dondel, but that doesn't sound right.

Let me think: Is it Antoine Duchesne? No.

Perhaps it's Bernard de Jussieu, but his dates are 1699-1777.

I need to recall accurately. I think it's Antoine Nicolas Duchesne. Let me verify: Antoine Nicolas Duchesne was a French naturalist, born in 1747 and died in 1827, which doesn't match.

That's not it.

Perhaps it's André Michaux. André Michaux was a French botanist and explorer, born in 1746 and died in 1802, not matching.

The dates are 1719-1786. Let me search my knowledge: Is it Jean-Jacques Rousseau? No, he was a philosopher, born 1712-1778.

Perhaps it's not a botanist. Horticulturalist could be someone like the creator of gardens.

I recall: Is it the Chevalier de la Salle? No.

Another thought: Perhaps it's Louis XV's gardener or something.

I think it's Antoine-Joseph Pernety, but his dates are 1716-1796, close but not exact.

1719-1786. Let me think of famous French figures.

Perhaps it's Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, but he was a naturalist, born 1707-1788, not exact.

This is tricky. Maybe it's Philibert Commerson, born 1729-1773.

Not matching.

Perhaps I need to consider that the user might be referring to a specific person from historical records. Upon second thought, I believe it's André Le Nôtre, but dates don't match.

No. Let's think differently: The description is 'French horticulturalist (1719-1786)', which might be a direct quote from a source.

After some reflection, I recall that there is a figure named Antoine Parmentier, but he was born in 1737 and died in 1813, known for potatoes.

Not that.

Perhaps it's Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, but he was born in 1744.

This is not helping. Let me try to recall exactly: I think the person is Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, but he was a writer, born 1737-1814.

Perhaps it's not who I think. Let's consider that the user might mean André Michaux's father or someone, but that's not right.

Upon further thought, I believe the historical figure is Antoine Nicolas Duchesne, but earlier I said his dates are wrong. Let me double-check: Upon correction, Antoine Nicolas Duchesne was born in 1747, no.

Actually, after thinking, I found that there is a figure named Louis XV's gardener, but let's search my memory: I think it's André Le Nôtre's successor or something.

Perhaps it's the Duc de Richelieu, but no.

Wait, suddenly I remember: Is it the Marquis de Sade? No, he's not a horticulturalist.

This is frustrating. Perhaps it's Jean Senebier, but he's Swiss.

Let's think of horticulturalists: One famous one is Joseph Banks, but he's English.

Another is Carl Linnaeus, Swedish.

For French, perhaps it's Pierre Poivre, born 1719 and died 1786! Let me confirm: Pierre Poivre was a French botanist and horticulturalist, born in 1719 and died in 1786.

Yes! Pierre Poivre is known for his work in botany and introducing plants to Mauritius and other places. He is indeed a French horticulturalist with those exact dates.

So, the historical figure is Pierre Poivre.

Therefore, my final answer is Pierre Poivre.
