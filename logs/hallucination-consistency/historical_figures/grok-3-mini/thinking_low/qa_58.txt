First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1842

- Died in 1898

- Known as a 'French Symbolist poet'

I need to recall who fits this description. The French Symbolist movement in poetry was prominent in the late 19th century. One of the most famous French Symbolist poets is Stéphane Mallarmé.

Let me verify the dates:

- Stéphane Mallarmé was born on March 18, 1842.

- He died on September 9, 1898.

That matches perfectly.

Other notable French poets from that era include Arthur Rimbaud, but he was born in 1854 and died in 1891, which doesn't match.

Paul Verlaine was born in 1844 and died in 1896, so close but not exact.

Charles Baudelaire is often associated with Symbolism, but he was born in 1821 and died in 1867, which is way off.

So, Mallarmé is the one who fits all the criteria.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since the query is straightforward, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer: Stéphane Mallarmé
