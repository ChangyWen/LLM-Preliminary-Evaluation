First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details: born in 1917, died in 1984, and known for being an Indian Prime Minister and politician (1917-1984).

I need to recall who that might be. From my knowledge, Indira Gandhi was an Indian Prime Minister. Let me verify her birth and death years.

Indira Gandhi was born on November 19, 1917, and she was assassinated on October 31, 1984. So, that matches the years: born in 1917 and died in 1984.

She is famously known as an Indian Prime Minister and politician. She served as the Prime Minister of India from 1966 to 1977 and again from 1980 until her death in 1984.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think. Another prominent Indian figure born in 1917 is, for example, Morarji Desai, but he was born in 1896, not 1917. He died in 1995.

Jawaharlal Nehru was born in 1889 and died in 1964, so not him.

Rajiv Gandhi was born in 1944 and died in 1991, so no.

Indira Gandhi is the one who matches perfectly.

The description says "known for 'Indian Prime Minister and politician (1917-1984)'", which directly points to her.

So, my final answer should be Indira Gandhi.
