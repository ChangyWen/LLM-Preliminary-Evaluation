*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1858

- Died in 1930

- Known for being a Chilean politician and President (1858-1930)

The phrase "President (1858-1930)" might be a bit confusing. It could mean the person was president from 1858 to 1930, but that doesn't make sense because no one was president for that entire period. More likely, it's describing the person as a Chilean politician and President, and the dates (1858-1930) are their birth and death years.

So, I need to identify a Chilean president who was born in 1858 and died in 1930.

Let me recall some Chilean presidents. One that comes to mind is Arturo Alessandri Palma. Let me verify his dates.

From my knowledge:

- Arturo Alessandri was born on December 20, 1868, and died on March 24, 1950. Wait, that doesn't match. 1868, not 1858.

That's not right. The user said 1858, so it's not him.

Another one: Perhaps it's Pedro Montt? Let me think.

Pedro Montt was President of Chile from 1906 to 1910. His birth and death: Born in 1849, died in 1910. Not matching.

What about José Manuel Balmaceda? He was president from 1886 to 1891, born in 1840, died in 1891. No.

Maybe it's someone else. Let me think of presidents born around 1858.

Perhaps it's Emiliano Figueroa. He was president from 1925 to 1927, born in 1865, died in 1931. Close but not exact.

The user specified born in 1858 and died in 1930. Is there a match?

Another one: Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. He was a dictator-president, born in 1877, died in 1960. No.

Perhaps it's not a president, but the description says "Chilean politician and President."

Maybe it's Juan Luis Sanfuentes. He was president from 1915 to 1920, born in 1858, and died in 1930. Let me confirm that.

Yes! Juan Luis Sanfuentes was born on December 27, 1858, and died on July 16, 1930. He served as President of Chile from 1915 to 1920.

That matches perfectly: Born 1858, died 1930, and was a Chilean politician and President.

So, the historical figure is Juan Luis Sanfuentes.

The user said "President (1858-1930)", which might be a way to denote the person's lifespan, not their term.

Yes, that makes sense.

My final answer should be: Juan Luis Sanfuentes

And I need to put it in a new line at the end of my response.
