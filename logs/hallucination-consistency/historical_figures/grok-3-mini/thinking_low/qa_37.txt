*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details: born in 1802, died in 1885, and described as a 'French poet, novelist, and dramatist (1802-1885)'.

I need to recall who this might be. The description matches Victor Hugo. Let me verify:

- Victor Hugo was born on February 26, 1802.

- He died on May 22, 1885.

- He is indeed a famous French poet, novelist, and dramatist. He's known for works like "Les Mis√©rables," "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame," and various poems and plays.

That seems to fit perfectly.

Is there anyone else who matches this description? Let me think. Alexandre Dumas was a French writer, but he was born in 1802 and died in 1870, not 1885. So, no.

Victor Hugo is the one who lived until 1885.

The description is almost verbatim how he's often referenced in encyclopedias or biographical notes.

The user asks to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since it's a straightforward question, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer format: Put it on a new line at the end.

So, something like:

After reasoning, the historical figure is Victor Hugo.

Then, on a new line: Victor Hugo

To make it precise: End with the answer on a new line.
