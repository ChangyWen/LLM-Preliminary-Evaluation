*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with specific details: born in 1162, died in 1227, and known as the founder and first khan of the Mongol Empire.

I need to recall who that is. From my knowledge, Genghis Khan fits this description perfectly. He was born in 1162 and died in 1227. He is indeed the founder of the Mongol Empire and was its first Great Khan.

Let me double-check the dates: Genghis Khan was born as Temüjin in 1162 and unified the Mongol tribes, proclaiming himself Genghis Khan in 1206. He died in 1227 during a military campaign.

The title matches: "founder and first khan of the Mongol Empire."

The user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since the query is straightforward, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

Response structure:
- Start with a brief confirmation or explanation if needed.
- End with the answer on a new line.
