First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1713

- Died in 1784

- Known as a 'French Enlightenment philosopher and encyclopædist'

I need to recall who this might be. The French Enlightenment period includes figures like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot. The key here is "encyclopædist," which points to someone involved in the Encyclopédie.

The Encyclopédie was a major project of the Enlightenment, and its primary editor was Denis Diderot. Let me verify his birth and death years.

Denis Diderot was born on October 5, 1713, and died on July 31, 1784. That matches perfectly.

He was indeed a French philosopher and the main force behind the Encyclopédie, which was a comprehensive reference work that embodied Enlightenment ideals.

So, the historical figure is Denis Diderot.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, but keep it concise, and then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end. For example:
