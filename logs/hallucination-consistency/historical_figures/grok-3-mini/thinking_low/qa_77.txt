*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in -470 (which I interpret as 470 BC, since negative years often denote BC in historical contexts).

- Died in -399 (which would be 399 BC).

- Known for being an 'ancient Greek philosopher'.

I need to recall who fits this description. The most famous ancient Greek philosopher born around 470 BC and died around 399 BC is Socrates.

Let me verify:

- Socrates was born in 470 BC.

- He died in 399 BC, after being sentenced to death.

Yes, that matches perfectly.

Other philosophers like Plato (born 427 or 428 BC) or Aristotle (born 384 BC) don't match the birth year.

So, the answer should be Socrates.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.

Final response structure:

- Optional: A short sentence confirming the details.

- Then, on a new line, just the name.
