*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details: born in 1452, died in 1519, and described as an 'Italian Renaissance polymath (1452-1519)'.

I need to recall who this refers to. The description matches Leonardo da Vinci perfectly. He was born on April 15, 1452, and died on May 2, 1519. He is famously known as a Renaissance polymath, meaning he excelled in many fields like painting, sculpture, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, invention, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography.

The phrase 'Italian Renaissance polymath (1452-1519)' is essentially a direct description of Leonardo da Vinci.

So, my final answer should be: Leonardo da Vinci.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. That means I should structure my response with any reasoning or explanation first, and then put the answer on a new line by itself.

For example:

[My response text]

Final answer: Leonardo da Vinci

I should ensure that my response is accurate and directly addresses the query.

Is there any other figure that fits this description? Michelangelo was born in 1475 and died in 1564, so no. Galileo was born in 1564. Raphael was born in 1483. None of them match the dates 1452-1519 except Leonardo da Vinci.

Alright, I'm confident.
