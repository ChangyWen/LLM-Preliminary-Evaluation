First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who meets these criteria:

- Born in 1945

- Died in 1981

- Known for being a 'Jamaican singer, songwriter and musician'

I need to recall who this might be. The most famous Jamaican singer, songwriter, and musician who fits this description is Bob Marley.

Let me verify the details:

- Bob Marley was born on February 6, 1946. Wait, is that right? I think I have the year wrong. Let me double-check my knowledge.

Actually, upon second thought, Bob Marley was born in 1945. No, let me confirm: He was born on February 6, 1945, in Nine Mile, Jamaica. Is that accurate?

I believe it's 1945. Yes, that's correct.

And he died on May 11, 1981, from cancer.

So, he was born in 1945 and died in 1981, and he's famously known as a Jamaican singer, songwriter, and musician.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think. Other Jamaican musicians from that era include people like Jimmy Cliff, but he was born in 1948 and is still alive. Or Desmond Dekker, born in 1941 and died in 2006. No one else matches exactly.

So, Bob Marley is the clear match.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since it's a straightforward question, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Final answer: Bob Marley

Make sure to put it on a new line at the end.
