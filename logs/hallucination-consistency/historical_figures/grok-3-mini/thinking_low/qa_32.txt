First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1783, died in 1842, and is known as a "19th century French writer."

I need to recall who fits this description. The 19th century spans from 1801 to 1900, but someone born in 1783 would be active in the early 19th century.

A famous French writer born in 1783 and died in 1842... That sounds like Victor Hugo. Let me double-check his dates.

Victor Hugo was born on February 26, 1802, and died on May 22, 1885. Wait, that doesn't match. 1802 is not 1783.

Hmm, wrong person. Let me think again.

Another famous French writer: Alexandre Dumas? He was born in 1802 and died in 1870. Still not 1783.

What about Honoré de Balzac? He was born in 1799 and died in 1850. Close, but not 1783.

1783... Let me think of earlier writers. Stendhal? Stendhal was born in 1783 and died in 1842. Is that right?

Yes! Stendhal, whose real name was Marie-Henri Beyle, was born on January 23, 1783, and died on July 23, 1842. He's a prominent 19th-century French writer, known for works like "The Red and the Black" and "The Charterhouse of Parma."

That matches perfectly: born 1783, died 1842, and a 19th-century French writer.

Is there anyone else? Let me make sure. Another possibility: Chateaubriand? François-René de Chateaubriand was born in 1768 and died in 1848. Not 1783.

Or, perhaps, someone like Benjamin Constant, but he was born in 1767 and died in 1830.

No, Stendhal is the one who fits exactly.

So, the historical figure is Stendhal.
