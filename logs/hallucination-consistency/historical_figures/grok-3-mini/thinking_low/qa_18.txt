*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1915

- Died in 2006

- Known for being a General and politician of Chile

- Specifically described as 'General, politician of Chile (1915-2006)'

I need to recall who this might be. From my knowledge, Augusto Pinochet fits this description perfectly.

Let me verify:

- Augusto Pinochet was born on November 25, 1915.

- He died on December 10, 2006.

- He was a general in the Chilean Army and became the President of Chile after a military coup in 1973. He ruled as a dictator until 1990.

So, he was indeed a general and a politician in Chile.

The description matches exactly: 'General, politician of Chile (1915-2006)'.

The user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is a straightforward query, I can just confirm and provide the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.

Response structure:

- I can start with a brief confirmation or just directly lead to the answer.

- End with the name on a new line.

For example:

"Based on the details provided, the historical figure is Augusto Pinochet.

Final answer:
Augusto Pinochet"

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, something like:

[Some response text]

Final answer:
[Name]

Yes.

Is there any other figure that might fit? Let me double-check. Is there another Chilean general and politician born in 1915 and died in 2006? I don't think so. Pinochet is the most prominent one.

Alright, I'm confident.
