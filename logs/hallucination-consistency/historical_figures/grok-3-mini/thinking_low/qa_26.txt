*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who meets these criteria:

- Born in 1921

- Died in 1981

- Known as a 'French singer-songwriter and poet'

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds like Serge Gainsbourg. Let me verify his details.

Serge Gainsbourg was indeed a French singer-songwriter and poet. He was born on April 1, 1921, and died on March 2, 1991. Wait, that doesn't match. The user said died in 1981, but Gainsbourg died in 1991.

That's a problem. Let me double-check. Upon second thought, Serge Gainsbourg was born in 1928, not 1921. No, wait:

Actually, let me think carefully. I believe Serge Gainsbourg was born in 1928. Wait, no:

Upon reflection, I think I'm confusing him. Let me recall accurately.

The user specified born in 1921 and died in 1981. Who fits that?

Another famous French figure: Jacques Brel? He was a Belgian singer-songwriter, not French, and he was born in 1929 and died in 1978.

Not matching.

What about Georges Brassens? He was a French singer-songwriter and poet. Let me check his dates.

Georges Brassens was born on October 22, 1921, and died on October 29, 1981. That matches perfectly!

Yes, Brassens was a prominent French singer-songwriter, known for his poetry and songs, often with social and political themes.

So, the historical figure is Georges Brassens.

To confirm:

- Born: 1921

- Died: 1981

- French singer-songwriter and poet: Yes.

I don't think there's anyone else who fits this exact description. For example, Ã‰dith Piaf was born in 1915 and died in 1963, so no.

Or Charles Trenet, born 1913, died 2001.

So, Georges Brassens is the correct answer.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.
