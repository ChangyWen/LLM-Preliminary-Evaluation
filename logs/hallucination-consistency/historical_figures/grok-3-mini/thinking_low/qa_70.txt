*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who:

- Was born in 1940

- Died in 1996

- Is known as a 'Russian-American poet'

I need to recall or know who fits this description. Let me think about famous Russian-American poets.

One name that comes to mind is Joseph Brodsky. Let me verify his details:

- Joseph Brodsky was born on May 24, 1940.

- He died on January 28, 1996.

- He was a Russian-American poet. He was born in the Soviet Union (Russia) and later became an American citizen. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1987.

That matches perfectly.

Is there anyone else who fits this? Let me double-check. Another poet might be Vladimir Nabokov, but he was a novelist and poet, born in 1899, not 1940. So, no.

Yevgeny Yevtushenko was a Russian poet, born in 1932 and died in 2017, so not matching.

Anna Akhmatova was born in 1889 and died in 1966, way off.

So, Joseph Brodsky seems to be the correct one.

The user specified "Russian-American poet," and Brodsky is indeed that. He emigrated to the United States in 1972 and became a U.S. citizen.

Finally, the response should end with the final answer on a new line.

Structure my response:

- I can briefly confirm or reason, but since the instruction is to give the final answer in a new line at the end, I'll keep it concise.

- End with: [Final Answer]

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, something like:

After thinking about it, the historical figure is Joseph Brodsky.

[Final Answer]

To make it clean:

The historical figure is Joseph Brodsky.

Final Answer: Joseph Brodsky

But exactly as per the instruction: put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, perhaps:

I believe the historical figure you're referring to is Joseph Brodsky.

Final Answer:

Joseph Brodsky

Yes.
