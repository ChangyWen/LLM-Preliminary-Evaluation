*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on the description: born in 1809, died in 1882, and known as a British naturalist and author of "On the Origin of Species, by Means of Natural Selection."

I recognize that this description matches Charles Darwin. He was a British naturalist, and his famous book is "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection," published in 1859. He was born on February 12, 1809, and died on April 19, 1882.

The description in the query is almost identical: "British naturalist, author of 'On the origin of species, by means of natural selection' (1809-1882)."

So, the historical figure is Charles Darwin.

The user asks to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since this is straightforward, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.

Response structure:

- I can start with a brief confirmation if I want, but to keep it simple, I'll go straight to the point.

- End with the answer on a new line.

For example:

After analyzing the description, the historical figure is Charles Darwin.

[New line]

Charles Darwin

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, something like:

I believe the historical figure you're referring to is Charles Darwin.

[New line]

Charles Darwin

That works.
