First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1879

- Died in 1941

- Known for being a Chilean politician and President (1879-1941)

The description says "Chilean politician and President (1879-1941)". This might be a bit confusing. It could mean the person was President from 1879 to 1941, but that doesn't make sense because no one lives that long in office. More likely, it's specifying the person's lifespan as (1879-1941).

In biographical descriptions, it's common to see something like "John Doe (1879-1941)", meaning born in 1879 and died in 1941.

So, I need to recall who is a famous Chilean President born in 1879 and died in 1941.

I think of Arturo Alessandri Palma. Let me verify his dates.

From my knowledge:

- Arturo Alessandri was a Chilean politician and President.

- He was born on December 20, 1868, and died on March 24, 1950. Wait, that doesn't match. 1868-1950, not 1879-1941.

That’s not right. Let me think again.

Perhaps it's Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. Let me recall:

- Carlos Ibáñez del Campo was a Chilean President.

- He was born on November 3, 1877, and died on April 28, 1960. Close but not exact; 1877 not 1879, and death in 1960.

Not matching.

Another one: Arturo Alessandri was born in 1868, as I said.

Perhaps it's Juan Esteban Montero. Let me think.

Juan Esteban Montero was President of Chile.

- Born: February 18, 1879

- Died: February 1, 1948

Died in 1948, not 1941. Close but not exact.

The query says died in 1941.

Who died in 1941?

Let me think of Chilean Presidents.

Pedro Aguirre Cerda was President from 1938 to 1941 and died in office.

- Born: February 6, 1879

- Died: November 25, 1941

Yes! That matches perfectly.

- Born in 1879

- Died in 1941

- Chilean politician and President.

So, Pedro Aguirre Cerda is the one.

I am confirming if he is indeed known as such.

Yes, he was the President of Chile from 1938 until his death in 1941.

Perfect match.

So, the historical figure is Pedro Aguirre Cerda.
