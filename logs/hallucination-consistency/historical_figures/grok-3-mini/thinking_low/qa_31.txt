*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1821

- Died in 1867

- Known as a 'French poet, essayist and art critic (1821-1867)'

I need to recall who this might be. The description sounds like Charles Baudelaire. Let me verify:

- Charles Baudelaire was a French poet, famous for his work "Les Fleurs du Mal."

- He was also an essayist and art critic.

- Born: April 9, 1821

- Died: August 31, 1867

That matches perfectly.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think:

- Arthur Rimbaud was a French poet, but he was born in 1854 and died in 1891, so that doesn't match.

- Victor Hugo was born in 1802 and died in 1885, not a match.

- Gustave Flaubert was a novelist, born in 1821, but he died in 1880, and he's not primarily known as a poet or art critic.

Flaubert was born in 1821, but the description specifies "poet, essayist and art critic," which fits Baudelaire more accurately. Flaubert is known for novels like "Madame Bovary."

So, Baudelaire is the clear match.

The user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation and then end with the answer.

Final answer: Charles Baudelaire
