First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1918

- Died in 2016

- Known as 'Chilean politician and former president (1918-2016)'

I need to recall who this might be. From my knowledge, Augusto Pinochet was a Chilean military general and dictator who ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990. But was he born in 1918 and died in 2016?

Let me double-check Pinochet's dates. Augusto Pinochet was born on November 25, 1915, and died on December 10, 2006. That doesn't match. He died in 2006, not 2016.

The description says "Chilean politician and former president (1918-2016)". Who fits that?

Another prominent Chilean president is Salvador Allende. He was born in 1908 and died in 1973. That doesn't match.

What about Michelle Bachelet? She was president of Chile, born in 1951, and still alive, I think. No, that doesn't fit.

Sebastián Piñera was president twice, born in 1949, died in 2024. Not matching.

Perhaps it's Eduardo Frei Montalva. He was president from 1964 to 1970, born in 1911, died in 1982. Not 1918-2016.

Let's think of someone born in 1918. Is there a Chilean president born in 1918?

Oh, wait, Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle? No, he was born in 1942.

Perhaps it's Patricio Aylwin. He was the first president after Pinochet, from 1990 to 1994. When was he born? I think in 1918.

Let me confirm: Patricio Aylwin was born on November 26, 1918, and died on April 19, 2016. Yes! That matches perfectly.

He was a Chilean politician and served as President of Chile from 1990 to 1994.

So, the historical figure is Patricio Aylwin.

The user specified "former president (1918-2016)", which aligns with his birth and death years.

My final answer should be his name: Patricio Aylwin.

I need to present it as per the instructions: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I'll structure my response accordingly.
