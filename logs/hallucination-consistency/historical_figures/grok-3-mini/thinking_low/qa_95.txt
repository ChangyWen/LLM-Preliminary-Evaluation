*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1896

- Died in 1940

- Known as 'Italian Marshal of the Air Force and minister (1896-1940)'

I need to recall who this might be. From my knowledge, this sounds like Italo Balbo. Let me verify:

- Italo Balbo was an Italian military officer and Blackshirt leader.

- He was born on June 6, 1896.

- He died on July 28, 1940.

- He was a Marshal of the Air Force in Italy and served as the Governor-General of Libya. He was also involved in aviation and politics under Mussolini's regime.

The description matches: Italian Marshal of the Air Force and minister. He held various ministerial positions and was prominent in the Italian Air Force.

Is there anyone else who fits this description? Let me think:

- Benito Mussolini was born in 1883 and died in 1945, so not him.

- Other Italian figures: Perhaps someone like Pietro Badoglio, but he was born in 1871 and died in 1956.

- No, Italo Balbo seems to be the correct one.

The user specifies "Italian Marshal of the Air Force and minister (1896-1940)", which directly points to Balbo.

My response should end with the final answer on a new line.

So, structure my response:

- I can briefly confirm or reason, but since the instruction is to give the final answer in a new line at the end, I'll keep it concise.

Final answer: Italo Balbo
