First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who meets these criteria:

- Born in 1937

- Died in 2012

- Known for being a 'Dutch writer and translator'

I need to recall or know of any famous Dutch writers or translators who fit this description.

I'm thinking of prominent Dutch figures. One that comes to mind is Harry Mulisch. Let me verify his details:

- Harry Mulisch was a Dutch writer.

- He was born in 1927, not 1937. That doesn't match.

Another one: W.F. Hermans. He was a Dutch writer.

- W.F. Hermans was born in 1921 and died in 1995. Not matching.

What about Jan Wolkers? He was a Dutch writer and sculptor.

- Born in 1925, died in 2007. Still not 1937-2012.

Perhaps Gerard Reve? He was a Dutch writer.

- Born in 1923, died in 2006. No.

I need someone born in 1937. Let me think of other Dutch authors.

How about Cees Nooteboom? He's a Dutch writer and translator.

- Cees Nooteboom was born in 1933. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check my knowledge. Actually, upon second thought, I think he was born in 1933.

That's not 1937.

Maybe it's Remco Campert. He was a Dutch writer.

- Born in 1929, still not 1937.

This is tricky. Let me think differently. Is there a well-known Dutch translator or writer born in 1937?

Another name: J. Bernlef. He was a Dutch writer and poet.

- J. Bernlef, whose real name was Hendrik Jan Marsman, was born in 1937 and died in 2012.

Yes! That sounds right.

Let me confirm:

- J. Bernlef was indeed born on January 14, 1937, and he died on October 29, 2012.

- He is known for his work as a Dutch writer and translator. He wrote novels, poetry, and translated works.

That matches perfectly: born 1937, died 2012, Dutch writer and translator.

So, the historical figure is J. Bernlef.

I should make sure there isn't another one. Is there anyone else?

For example, Lucebert was a Dutch painter and poet, born in 1924, died in 1994.

No, J. Bernlef seems to be the correct one.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I'll structure my response accordingly.
