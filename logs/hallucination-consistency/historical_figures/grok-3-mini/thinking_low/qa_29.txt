First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1854

- Died in 1891

- Known as a "19th century French poet who influenced modern literature and arts, and prefigured surrealism"

I need to recall who this might be. From my knowledge, Arthur Rimbaud fits this description perfectly.

Let me verify the facts:

- Arthur Rimbaud was born on October 20, 1854.

- He died on November 10, 1891.

- He was a French poet whose work influenced modern literature and arts. His poetry is often seen as a precursor to surrealism due to its innovative style, symbolism, and exploration of the subconscious.

Rimbaud's major works were written in his teens, and he stopped writing poetry by the age of 21, which adds to his legendary status.

Other French poets from that era include Charles Baudelaire (born 1821, died 1867) and Paul Verlaine (born 1844, died 1896), but they don't match the birth and death years.

- Baudelaire: 1821-1867

- Verlaine: 1844-1896

Rimbaud collaborated with Verlaine, but Verlaine's dates don't match.

So, Rimbaud is the correct match.

The user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer format: Just the name, like "Arthur Rimbaud" on a new line.
