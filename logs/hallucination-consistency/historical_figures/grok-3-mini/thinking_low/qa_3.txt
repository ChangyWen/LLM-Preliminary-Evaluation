*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure. The details given are:

- Born in 1809

- Died in 1865

- Known for being the '16th president of the United States (1809-1865)'

This description matches Abraham Lincoln. Let me verify:

- Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809.

- He died on April 15, 1865.

- He was indeed the 16th President of the United States, serving from 1861 until his assassination in 1865.

The phrase '16th president of the United States (1809-1865)' directly points to Lincoln, as those dates align with his birth and death.

I need to respond by giving the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, my response should end with the name on a new line.

Structure my response:

- I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, but keep it concise.

- End with the answer on a new line.

For example:

"I believe the historical figure you're referring to is Abraham Lincoln, who matches the description provided."

Then, on a new line: "Abraham Lincoln"

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, something like:

After reasoning, put the final answer.

Final answer: Abraham Lincoln
