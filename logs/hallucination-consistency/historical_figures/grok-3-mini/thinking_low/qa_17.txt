*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1921, died in 1984, and is known for being a 'Dutch footballer (1921-1984)'.

I need to recall or know who this refers to. From my knowledge, there's a famous Dutch footballer who fits this description. I believe it's Johan Cruyff. Let me double-check his details.

Johan Cruyff was born on April 25, 1947, and died on March 24, 2016. That doesn't match. 1921-1984 is not Cruyff.

Who else? Maybe it's not Cruyff. Let me think of other Dutch footballers.

Perhaps it's Faas Wilkes. I think Faas Wilkes was a Dutch footballer born in 1923 and died in 2006. That doesn't match.

The description is 'Dutch footballer (1921-1984)'. I need to find someone who was born in 1921 and died in 1984.

Let me search my knowledge: Is there a footballer named Abe Lenstra? Abe Lenstra was a Dutch footballer born in 1920 and died in 1985. Close, but not exact.

1920-1985 is not 1921-1984.

Another one: Frans Thijssen? No, he's later.

Perhaps it's Gerrit Keizer. I'm not sure.

Maybe it's Rinus Michels, but he was a coach and player, born in 1928.

This is tricky. Perhaps the user is referring to a specific figure from Wikipedia or a database.

Upon second thought, I recall that there might be a footballer named Cor van der Hart or something, but let's think differently.

Perhaps it's Johnny Rep, but he's born in 1951.

I need to consider if this is a real query. Maybe it's Hendrikus "Henk" Schijvenaar or someone obscure.

Perhaps it's Faas Wilkes again, but no.

Let's think: I believe the person is Frans de Munck. Frans de Munck was a Dutch footballer born in 1922 and died in 2018. Not matching.

Another one: Kees Rijvers, born in 1926.

This is not working. Perhaps it's Abe Lenstra, and the dates are approximate.

The user specified exactly 1921-1984.

Upon further reflection, I think it might be Jan van Roessel or someone, but I'm not sure.

Perhaps it's not a footballer. The query says 'Dutch footballer (1921-1984)', so it should be.

After thinking, I recall that there is a Dutch footballer named Cor Brom, but his dates are 1932-2008.

This is frustrating. Maybe it's Piet van Reenen or something.

Perhaps the most famous one is Johan Cruyff, but his dates are wrong.

The user might have the dates wrong, but I have to go with what's given.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, I believe the historical figure is likely "Faas Wilkes", but his birth is 1923.

Let's assume it's Abe Lenstra, as he is a prominent Dutch footballer from that era, born 27 October 1920, died 4 September 1985, which is close to 1921-1984.

But the user said 1921-1984, so perhaps it's not.

Another possibility: Rinus Terlouw or no.

I found it: I think it's "Henk Groot". Henk Groot was a Dutch footballer born in 1938, no.

Perhaps "Jan Studer" or no.

This is not helping. Let's think of the most likely candidate. Upon searching my memory, I believe the person is "Frans Hoek", but that's not right.

Perhaps it's "Karel Bonsink". No.

I need to conclude that the most plausible answer is Abe Lenstra, even if the dates don't match exactly, or perhaps the user means someone else.

Upon second thought, I recall that there is a Dutch footballer named "Cor van Rijn", but I'm not sure.

Perhaps it's "Piet Ouderland". This is ridiculous.

Let's try a different approach: In Wikipedia, if I search for Dutch footballers born in 1921, who died in 1984?

From my knowledge, one that fits is "Jan van der Lee", but I'm not sure.

Actually, after thinking, I believe it's "Faas Wilkes", and the dates are approximate in the user's mind.

But no, the user specified.

Perhaps it's "Johan Neeskens", but he's 1951.

I give up; I think the intended answer is Johan Cruyff, even though the dates are wrong, but that doesn't make sense.

The query says "known for 'Dutch footballer (1921-1984)'", which might be a direct quote from a source.

Upon reflection, I think it might be "Ab Bakalite" or no.

Finally, I recall: It's likely "Abe Lenstra". Let's go with that.

So, my final answer will be Abe Lenstra.
