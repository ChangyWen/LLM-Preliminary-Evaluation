*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details: born in 1732, died in 1799, and known for being the '1st president of the United States (1732–1799)'.

I need to recall who that is. The first President of the United States was George Washington. Let me verify his birth and death years. George Washington was born on February 22, 1732, and died on December 14, 1799. That matches perfectly.

The description says '1st president of the United States (1732–1799)', which directly points to George Washington.

My task is to provide the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." That means I can have some preamble if needed, but end with the answer on a new line.

To keep it simple and direct, I could just confirm and then state the answer.

Final answer should be just the name, I assume, like "George Washington".

Response structure:
- I might start with a brief confirmation or nothing at all.
- End with the answer on a new line.

For example:
"I believe the historical figure you're referring to is George Washington.

George Washington"

But to be precise, put it on a new line at the end.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, something like:

[Some text]

Final answer:
George Washington

That makes sense.

Is there any chance it's not George Washington? No, the details are exact.

Alright, let's formulate the response.
