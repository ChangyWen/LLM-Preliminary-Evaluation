*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure based on specific details: born in 1899, died in 1986, and described as an 'Argentine short story writer, essayist, poet and translator (1899-1986)'.

I need to recall who this might be. From my knowledge, Jorge Luis Borges fits this description perfectly. Let me verify:

- Born: 1899

- Died: 1986

- Nationality: Argentine

- Professions: He was indeed a short story writer, essayist, poet, and translator. He's famous for works like "Ficciones" and "The Aleph."

That matches exactly.

The user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly. I can provide a brief confirmation or just go straight to the answer, but to make it clear, I'll keep it concise.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.

Response structure:

- I can start with a sentence confirming or leading to the answer.

- Then, end with the name on a new line.

For example:

"Based on the details provided, the historical figure is Jorge Luis Borges.

Jorge Luis Borges"

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, something like:

"I believe the historical figure you're referring to is Jorge Luis Borges.

Final answer:
Jorge Luis Borges"

To keep it simple, just end with the name on a new line.

Make sure there's no other figure that fits. Is there anyone else born in 1899 and died in 1986 who is an Argentine writer? Borges is the most prominent one, and the description matches him exactly.

I'm confident with this.
