First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1639

- Died in 1699

- Known as a 'French dramatist'

I need to recall who fits this description. I know some famous French dramatists from that era.

The most prominent French dramatist around that time is Molière. Let me verify his dates.

Molière was born in 1622, not 1639. That doesn't match. Let me double-check.

Actually, upon second thought, Molière was born in 1622 and died in 1673. So, that's not him.

Who else? Another famous French dramatist is Jean Racine. Let me check his dates.

Jean Racine was born in 1639 and died in 1699. Yes! That matches perfectly.

Confirming: Racine was born on December 22, 1639, and died on April 21, 1699. He's indeed a French dramatist, known for plays like "Phèdre" and "Andromaque."

Is there anyone else who fits this? Pierre Corneille was born in 1606 and died in 1684, so no.

Voltaire was born in 1694, which is later.

So, Jean Racine is the one.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

My response should be straightforward: explain briefly if needed, but end with the answer on a new line.

Structure:

- I can start with a confirmation or brief statement.

- Then, end with the answer.

Final answer: Jean Racine
