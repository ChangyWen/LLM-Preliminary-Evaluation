*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1214, died in 1270, and is known as the 'king of France'. I need to recall who that is.

I know that Louis IX was a king of France. Let me verify his dates. Louis IX, also known as Saint Louis, was born in 1214 and died in 1270. That matches perfectly.

He was indeed the King of France from 1226 until his death in 1270. He's famous for his piety, the Seventh and Eighth Crusades, and being canonized as a saint.

The user specified "known for 'king of France'", which might be a bit awkwardly phrased, but I think it means he is known as the King of France.

Other kings of France around that time: Louis VIII was before him, and Philip III was after. Louis IX fits the dates exactly.

So, the answer should be Louis IX.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation and then end with the answer.

Final response structure:

- A short explanation or confirmation.

- Then, on a new line, the answer.
