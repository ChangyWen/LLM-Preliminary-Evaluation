*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1756

- Died in 1791

- Known as an 'Austrian composer of the Classical period'

I need to recall who fits this description. The most famous Austrian composer from the Classical period is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Let me verify the dates:

- Mozart was born on January 27, 1756.

- He died on December 5, 1791.

That matches perfectly.

Is he Austrian? Mozart was born in Salzburg, which was part of the Holy Roman Empire at the time, and it's now in Austria, so he's commonly referred to as an Austrian composer.

He is indeed one of the most prominent composers of the Classical period.

Are there any other composers who might fit this? Let's think:

- Haydn was born in 1732 and died in 1809, so that doesn't match.

- Beethoven was born in 1770 and died in 1827, which is later.

- Schubert was born in 1797, way later.

So, no one else comes to mind who matches these exact dates and description.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since the query is straightforward, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.
