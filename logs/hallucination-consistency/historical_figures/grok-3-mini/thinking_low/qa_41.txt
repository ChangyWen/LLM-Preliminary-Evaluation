First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1896

- Died in 1986

- Known for being a Chilean politician and President

- The description is '(1896-1986)'

I need to recall who this might be. From my knowledge, a famous Chilean President born in 1896 and died in 1986 is Arturo Alessandri Palma. Let me double-check that.

Arturo Alessandri Palma was indeed a President of Chile. He was born on December 20, 1868, and died on March 24, 1950. That doesn't match. 1868 to 1950 is not 1896 to 1986.

That's wrong. Let me think again. Who was born in 1896 and was a Chilean President?

I believe it's Eduardo Frei Montalva. Let me verify: Eduardo Frei Montalva was born on January 16, 1911, and died on January 22, 1982. That's not it either.

Perhaps it's Salvador Allende. Salvador Allende was born on July 26, 1908, and died on September 11, 1973. Still not matching.

The description says "Chilean politician and President (1896-1986)". Let me think of Augusto Pinochet. Augusto Pinochet was born on November 25, 1915, and died on December 10, 2006. No.

This is tricky. Is there a President born in 1896?

Perhaps it's Arturo Alessandri's son, Jorge Alessandri. Jorge Alessandri Rodr√≠guez was born on May 19, 1896, and died on August 31, 1986. Yes! That matches perfectly.

Jorge Alessandri was a Chilean politician and served as President of Chile from 1958 to 1964. He was born in 1896 and died in 1986.

So, the historical figure is Jorge Alessandri.

My response should be straightforward: explain briefly if needed, but end with the answer on a new line.
