*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who meets these criteria:

- Born in 1927

- Died in 2010

- Known for being a 'Dutch writer'

I need to recall or know of any famous Dutch writers born in 1927 and died in 2010.

Let me think about prominent Dutch writers. One that comes to mind is W.F. Hermans. Let me verify his details.

Willem Frederik Hermans was a Dutch writer. Was he born in 1927? I believe he was born on September 1, 1921, and died in 1995. That doesn't match.

Another one: Harry Mulisch. He was a Dutch writer. Born in 1927? Yes, Harry Mulisch was born on July 29, 1927, and he died on October 30, 2010. That matches perfectly!

Let me double-check. Harry Mulisch is indeed a famous Dutch author, known for works like "The Assault" and "The Discovery of Heaven." He was born in 1927 and passed away in 2010.

Is there anyone else? Jan Wolkers was a Dutch writer, born in 1925 and died in 2007, so that doesn't match.

Gerard Reve was born in 1923 and died in 2006.

So, Harry Mulisch seems to be the correct one.

The user specified "known for 'Dutch writer'", which might be a bit vague, but it's clear they mean a writer from the Netherlands.

My final answer should be just the name, on a new line at the end of my response.

Response structure: I should keep it concise, but since the user said "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response," I can have a brief explanation if needed, but end with the answer.

The user didn't ask for an explanation, so I'll just confirm and provide the answer.

Final answer: Harry Mulisch
