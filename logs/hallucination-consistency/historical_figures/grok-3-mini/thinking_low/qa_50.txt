*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1622

- Died in 1673

- Known for being a 'French playwright and actor'

I need to recall who fits this description. I know of Molière, who was a famous French playwright and actor.

Let me verify the dates:

- Molière was born on January 15, 1622.

- He died on February 17, 1673.

That matches perfectly.

Is there anyone else who fits this? Let me think. Other French figures from that era include Louis XIV, but he's a king, not a playwright. Racine and Corneille were playwrights, but their dates don't match.

- Pierre Corneille: Born 1606, died 1684.

- Jean Racine: Born 1639, died 1699.

So, neither matches the 1622-1673 window.

Therefore, it's definitely Molière.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief confirmation or explanation, then end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer format: Just the name, like "Molière" on a new line.
