*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1606

- Died in 1684

- Known as a 'French tragedian'

I need to recall who that might be. A French tragedian is someone who wrote tragedies in French theater.

The most famous French tragedian from that era is Jean Racine. Let me verify his dates.

Jean Racine was born in 1639 and died in 1699. That doesn't match. 1639 is not 1606.

That's not right. Who else?

Pierre Corneille is another famous French playwright known for tragedies. Let me check his dates.

Pierre Corneille was born in 1606 and died in 1684. Yes! That matches perfectly.

Confirming: Born June 6, 1606, and died October 1, 1684. He's known for plays like "Le Cid," which is a tragedy.

So, Pierre Corneille fits all the criteria.

Is there anyone else? Molière was a contemporary, but he's more known for comedies, not tragedies. Molière was born in 1622 and died in 1673, so that doesn't match.

Jean-Baptiste Racine, as I thought earlier, doesn't match the dates.

Therefore, Pierre Corneille is the correct answer.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "Based on the details provided, the historical figure is Pierre Corneille."

Then, end with the final answer on a new line.
