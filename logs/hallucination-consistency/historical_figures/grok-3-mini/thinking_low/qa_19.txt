First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure who was born in 1882, died in 1942, and is known as a 'Belarusian writer (1882-1942)'.

I need to recall or know who this refers to. From my knowledge, there's a famous Belarusian writer who fits this description. I believe it's Maksim Bahdanovič. Let me double-check that.

Maksim Bahdanovič was a Belarusian poet and writer. Let me confirm his birth and death years. Upon thinking, I recall that Maksim Bahdanovič was born in 1891 and died in 1917. That doesn't match. 1882-1942 is not him.

Who else? Another prominent Belarusian writer is Yanka Kupala. Let me think about his dates. Yanka Kupala was born in 1882 and died in 1942. Yes, that sounds right.

Confirming: Yanka Kupala, whose real name was Ivan Daminikavich Lutsevich, was a Belarusian poet and writer. He was born on June 7, 1882, and died on June 28, 1942.

That matches perfectly: born in 1882, died in 1942, and known as a Belarusian writer.

Is there anyone else who fits this? Another one might be Yakub Kolas, but his dates are 1882-1956, which doesn't match the death in 1942.

Yakub Kolas was also born in 1882, but he died in 1956. So, not him.

Therefore, Yanka Kupala is the one who was born in 1882 and died in 1942.

The user specified 'Belarusian writer (1882-1942)', which directly points to Yanka Kupala.

My final answer should be his name: Yanka Kupala.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.
