First, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure with these details:

- Born in 1879

- Died in 1954

- Known as an 'Australian writer and feminist'

I need to recall or know who fits this description. I'm thinking of famous Australian writers and feminists from that era.

One name that comes to mind is Miles Franklin. Let me verify her details:

- Stella Maria Sarah Miles Franklin was an Australian writer.

- She was born on 14 October 1879.

- She died on 19 September 1954.

- She's best known for her novel "My Brilliant Career" and was a strong advocate for women's rights, so she qualifies as a feminist.

That matches perfectly.

Is there anyone else who fits this? Let me double-check.

Another possible figure is Christina Stead, but she was born in 1902 and died in 1983, so that doesn't match.

Or perhaps Dame Mary Gilmore, who was born in 1865 and died in 1962, which doesn't match the birth year.

What about Nettie Palmer? She was born in 1885 and died in 1964, so not a match.

Vance Palmer was her husband, and he's a writer, but not a feminist.

So, Miles Franklin seems to be the correct one.

The user specified to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be clear and direct. I don't need to add extra information unless necessary, but since the query is straightforward, I can just confirm and state the answer.

Final answer format: Put the name on a new line at the end.
