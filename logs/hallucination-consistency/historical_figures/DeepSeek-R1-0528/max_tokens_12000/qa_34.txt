Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1938, died in 1980, and described as a "Soviet singer, songwriter, poet, and actor." That's a very specific set of details. 

Hmm... Soviet cultural figures from that era... born in '38, died in '80... that lifespan immediately makes me think of Vladimir Vysotsky. Let me verify the dates: yes, he was born January 25, 1938 and died July 25, 1980. Perfect match. 

The description fits perfectly too - he was iconic as a singer-songwriter (with his signature raspy voice), wrote profound poetry, and was a celebrated stage/film actor. His work was deeply influential despite Soviet censorship. 

The user seems to want just the name, but I should confirm why this answer is correct. Maybe they're testing historical knowledge or researching Soviet culture. The "final answer on new line" request suggests they might be using this for some automated system. 

I'll keep it concise but add brief context since his cultural significance is worth noting. The death at 42 from heart failure was tragic - his funeral drew massive crowds. 

Final answer is definitely Vladimir Vysotsky. I'll present it cleanly at the end as requested.
