*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1473 and died in 1543. They provided key descriptors: Renaissance-era mathematician, astronomer, clergyman, and notably formulated the heliocentric model. That's a clear set of identifiers. 

Hmm... the heliocentric model part immediately triggers the association with Copernicus. Let me mentally verify the dates: 1473 to 1543 matches Nicolaus Copernicus perfectly. The "clergyman" detail aligns too—he was a canon in the Catholic Church. 

The user seems to want a straightforward answer, but I wonder if they're testing historical accuracy or just need confirmation. The request for a "final answer in a new line" suggests they might be using this for a quiz or study purpose. Better keep it precise. 

Wait—should I mention his full name or just "Copernicus"? Since they didn't specify, "Nicolaus Copernicus" feels most respectful to his legacy. Also, no need to over-explain unless asked; the descriptors already cover his achievements. 

...Double-checking birth/death years: yep, 19 Feb 1473 – 24 May 1543. No other figure fits this combo. Safe to conclude. 

Final phrasing: Clear, no fluff, end with the name as requested. User probably values efficiency here. 

**Nicolaus Copernicus**
