*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a Chilean politician and President who lived from 1879 to 1941.
 The key points:
   - Born in 1879
   - Died in 1941
   - Served as President of Chile

 Let's recall some prominent Chilean presidents from that era. One of the most famous Chilean presidents of the early 20th century is Arturo Alessandri Palma.

 Arturo Alessandri:
   - Born: December 20, 1868 (Wait, that does not match 1879)
   - Died: August 24, 1950

 So that does not match.

 Another prominent figure is Pedro Aguirre Cerda:
   - Born: February 6, 1879
   - Died: November 25, 1941
   - He was President of Chile from 1938 until his death in 1941.

 Therefore, Pedro Aguirre Cerda fits the criteria.

 Final answer:
Pedro Aguirre Cerda
