*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a historical figure who:
 - Was born in 1700 and died in 1755.
 - Is described as a "German-born French soldier and statesman".

The most prominent figure that fits this description is **Maurice de Saxe**. 

He was born in Goslar, Germany, in 1696? Wait, let me double-check the birth year. 

Wait, the question says born in 1700. But Maurice de Saxe was born on October 28, 1696. That doesn't match 1700.

Alternatively, let's consider another figure. 

Wait, perhaps I have the wrong person. Let me think again.

Another possibility is **Charles Louis Auguste Fouquet, comte de Belle-Isle** (1684–1761) but he doesn't fit the years.

Wait, let me recall: 

Perhaps it's **Louis Charles Armand Fouquet, chevalier de Belle-Isle** (1693–1747) but that also doesn't match.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. 

The correct figure that matches the description and the years is:

**Hermann Maurice, comte de Saxe** (in French: Maurice de Saxe) but his birth year is 1696. 

Alternatively, let's check the death year: Maurice de Saxe died in 1750? Actually, he died in 1750? No, he died on November 20, 1750. But the question says 1755.

Wait, so the years don't match. 

Then who could it be?

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo? Or maybe I'm missing someone.

Let me search my memory: 

Another famous German-born French soldier and statesman of that era is **Étienne François, duc de Choiseul** (1719–1785) — but he was born too late and died later.

Wait, let me think of someone else.

Wait, what about **Nicolas Luckner**? He was born in 1722 and died in 1794 — too late.

Wait, perhaps I have to adjust. 

Wait, let me try to recall: 

There is a famous military leader who served under Louis XV and was a Marshal of France, born in 1696 and died in 1750? But the question says 1700 and 1755.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is Maurice de Saxe even though the years are off? But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, there is **Louis Georges Érasme de Contades** (1704–1793) — but he doesn't fit the death year.

Wait, let's try a different approach. 

The description "German-born French soldier and statesman" and the years 1700-1755:

- Born in 1700: so we are looking for someone born that year.
- Died in 1755.

One of the most famous military leaders of that time was **Leopold Joseph von Daun** (1705–1766) but he was Austrian and served the Habsburgs, not French.

Wait, perhaps **Ulrich Friedrich Waldemar von Löwendal** (1700–1755). 

He was born on April 1, 1700, in Hamburg (then part of the Holy Roman Empire, so German) and died on May 27, 1755, in Paris. He was a French field marshal and statesman of German and Danish descent.

He served in the French army and became a Marshal of France in 1747. He was also the governor of Metz and later of Flanders.

This matches:

- Born in 1700 (in Hamburg, Germany)
- Died in 1755 (in Paris, France)
- German-born and became a French soldier and statesman.

So the answer is **Ulrich Friedrich Waldemar, Comte de Lowendal** (or in French, **Ulric Frédéric Woldemar de Lowendal**).

But note: he is less well-known than Maurice de Saxe, but the years fit.

Alternatively, the question might have a typo and intended Maurice de Saxe (1696–1750) but the years given are 1700–1755.

Given the exact years, we must go with Lowendal.

But let me double-check:

- Birth: 1 April 1700, Hamburg
- Death: 27 May 1755, Paris

And he was a Marshal of France and served as a statesman.

So the answer is **Ulrich Friedrich Waldemar, Comte de Lowendal**.

However, the question asks for the name as it is commonly known. In French, he is often called **Ulric Frédéric Woldemar de Lowendal** or simply **Maréchal de Lowendal**.

But to be precise, let's write the name as:

**Ulric Frédéric Woldemar, comte de Lowendal**

But note that the question uses the term "statesmen" (which is a typo for statesman) and soldier.

Alternatively, if we look for a more famous figure, we might be missing someone.

Wait, another possibility: **Louis Charles César Le Tellier, comte d'Estrées** (1695–1771) — but born in 1695, not 1700.

Wait, what about **Victor-François, 2nd duc de Broglie** (1718–1804) — born too late.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is Maurice de Saxe, but the birth and death years are wrong? That would be a common mistake.

But the question says 1700 and 1755.

Given that, I think the correct answer is Lowendal.

But let me check the death of Maurice de Saxe: he died in 1750, not 1755.

So we must go with Lowendal.

Therefore, the answer is:

Ulric Frédéric Woldemar, comte de Lowendal

But to write it in a simpler form, he is often known as **Marshal Lowendal**.

Alternatively, in some references, he is called **Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal**.

But the question says "German-born French soldier and statesmen (1700-1755)" and that matches Löwendal.

So the final answer is:

**Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal**

But note: the question uses the term "statesmen", which is plural, but it should be singular. That might be a typo in the question.

Therefore, I will go with:

Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal

But let me write it in the French version as he served France and that is how he is commonly known in French history.

In French: **Ulric Frédéric Woldemar de Lowendal**

However, the exact spelling can vary.

But to be safe, we can use the name as it appears in English sources: **Ulrich Frederick Waldemar, Count de Lowendal**

But the question doesn't require the title. So just the last name? But that might be confusing.

Alternatively, the most common reference is as **Löwendal** or **Lowendal**.

But I think the full name as commonly known is **Ulrich Friedrich Waldemar von Löwendal**.

Alternatively, we can use the French spelling: **Ulric Frédéric Woldemar, comte de Lowendal**.

But the question asks for the name of the historical figure, so we should give the name that is most recognized.

However, since the question does not specify, I will write:

**Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal**

But note: the birth year and death year match exactly.

So, final answer:

Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal

But wait, let me check again: is there a more famous figure?

What about **Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine**? He was born in 1712 and died in 1780 — too late.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, **Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz** (1721–1773) — too late.

Wait, I think Löwendal is the correct one.

Therefore, the answer is Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal.

But let me write it as:

**Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal**

However, in many sources, he is called **Ulric Frédéric de Lowendal** in French.

Given that the question uses the English description, we might use the German name.

But I think the intended answer might be Maurice de Saxe, but the years are off.

Wait, let me check the death of Maurice de Saxe: he died on November 30, 1750. So he died in 1750, not 1755.

Therefore, we must go with Löwendal.

So, the answer is:

Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal

But to be consistent with the French context, we can use the French version of his name: **Ulric Frédéric de Lowendal**.

But the question says "German-born", so we can use the German name.

However, I think the most common way to refer to him in English is as **Count Lowendal** or **Marshal Lowendal**.

But the question asks for the name.

So I will write: **Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal**

But note: the question says "statesmen" (plural) but it should be singular. That might be a typo.

Final decision: 

Given the years and the description, the historical figure is **Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal**.

But let me see if there is another possibility.

Wait, there is also **Johann Hermann, comte de Nesselrode** (1700-1755) but he was a diplomat and not primarily a soldier? And he was in the service of the Holy Roman Empire, not French.

So I think Löwendal is the correct one.

Therefore, the answer is:

Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal

But to be precise and to match the French context, let's write it as:

**Ulric Frédéric Woldemar, comte de Lowendal**

However, the question does not require the title. So we can write:

**Ulric Frédéric de Lowendal**

But the birth name was German: Ulrich Friedrich Woldemar von Löwendal.

But in English, we might write:

**Ulrich Frederick Waldemar von Löwendal**

But that's long.

Alternatively, we can use the name he is most known by: **Marshal Lowendal**. But the question asks for the name of the historical figure, so the full name is better.

But the question does not specify full name. It just asks for the name.

So I will write:

**Ulrich von Löwendal**

But that might be too short.

Alternatively, **Count Löwendal**.

But I think the full name is appropriate.

However, to keep it simple and match the given years, I will write:

**Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal**

But note: the question says "German-born French soldier and statesman". He was a French Marshal and a governor.

So, I think we have the right person.

Final Answer:

Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal

But let me write it in the boxed format as requested.

**Final Answer**

```text
Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal
```

However, I have a doubt because he is not as famous as Maurice de Saxe. But the years are exact.

Alternatively, the question might have intended Maurice de Saxe and the years are approximate? But the question says "born in 1700, died in 1755", which is specific.

So I must go with Löwendal.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Ulrich Friedrich von Löwendal
