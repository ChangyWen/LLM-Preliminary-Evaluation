Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1854, died in 1891, described as a 19th-century French poet who influenced modern literature and arts and prefigured surrealism. I need to recall who this might be. The birth and death years are specific: 1854 to 1891. That's a 37-year lifespan, which is quite short, so it must be someone who died young.

The description mentions "prefigured surrealism," which is a key clue. Surrealism emerged in the 20th century, so the poet in question would have had innovative, dream-like, or irrational elements in their work. I'm thinking of French poets from that era. Names like Charles Baudelaire or Paul Verlaine come to mind, but let's check their dates.

Baudelaire was born in 1821 and died in 1867, so that doesn't match. Verlaine was born in 1844 and died in 1896—close, but not exact. Then there's Arthur Rimbaud. I think he was born in 1854 and died in 1891. That fits the timeline perfectly.

Now, confirming his influence: Rimbaud is famous for revolutionizing poetry with works like "A Season in Hell" and "Illuminations." He used vivid imagery, symbolism, and unconventional structures, which later surrealists like André Breton admired. Breton even called Rimbaud a precursor to surrealism. So, Rimbaud's life and impact align with the query.

The user might be a student, researcher, or someone curious about literary history. They provided clear details, suggesting they have some background or are verifying information. Their actual need is straightforward: identify the name based on facts. But deeper down, they could be exploring how early poets shaped modern art, or perhaps they're inspired to learn more about surrealism's roots. I should ensure my answer is accurate and concise to build trust.

Finally, the instruction is to put the answer on a new line at the end. I'll structure my response to explain the reasoning first, then end with "Arthur Rimbaud" as specified.

Based on the criteria provided:

1.  **Born in 1854, Died in 1891**: This lifespan fits perfectly.
2.  **19th Century French Poet**: He was a major French poet active in the latter half of the 19th century.
3.  **Influenced Modern Literature and Arts**: His radical innovations in language, imagery, and form profoundly impacted Symbolism, Dadaism, Surrealism, and modernist literature far beyond France. Figures like André Breton, Paul Claudel, and countless others cited his influence.
4.  **Prefigured Surrealism**: His work, especially "Les Illuminations" (Illuminations) and "Une Saison en Enfer" (A Season in Hell), explored dream logic, the irrational, the unconscious mind, startling imagery, and the deliberate derangement of the senses. These elements were foundational to the Surrealist movement, which explicitly claimed him as a forerunner.

The historical figure who meets all these descriptions is **Arthur Rimbaud**.
