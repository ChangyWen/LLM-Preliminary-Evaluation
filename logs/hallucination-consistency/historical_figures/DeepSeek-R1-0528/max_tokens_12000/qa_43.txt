Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1524, died in 1580, and known as a Portuguese poet. Let me recall the major Portuguese poets from that era. The timeframe points to the Renaissance period. 

The lifespan exactly matches Luís de Camões - he was born in 1524 and died in 1580. He's famously known for writing "Os Lusíadas," Portugal's national epic. The dates are very specific and align perfectly with Camões. 

I should verify if there are any other notable Portuguese poets from that exact period. Francisco de Sá de Miranda comes to mind, but he died in 1558. António Ferreira died in 1569. So Camões is indeed the only major poet fitting these exact dates. 

The user seems to want a straightforward identification, probably for quick reference or verification. They specifically requested the final answer on a new line, suggesting they might be copying it for some practical use. 

The response should be concise but accurate. I'll confirm it's Camões and present the answer clearly at the end as instructed. No need for extra details unless asked - the user appears to value precision and efficiency here.
