Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1732 and died in 1799, specifically noted as the first president of the United States. 

Hmm, this seems like a straightforward factual question. The dates and role perfectly match George Washington. The user even quoted the exact title "1st president of the United States (1732–1799)" which appears verbatim in many historical records. 

I notice they want the answer isolated in a new line at the end - probably for easy copying. The request feels like it might be for a quiz, homework, or some automated processing. 

No need to overthink this one. The answer is unambiguous. I'll confirm it's Washington and follow the formatting request precisely. 

*Double-checks dates and title against memory:*
- Born February 22, 1732
- Died December 14, 1799
- Unanimously elected first US president
- Served two terms (1789-1797)
- The "Father of His Country" epithet reinforces the match

Final answer will be clean and standalone as requested.
