Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1821 and died in 1867, specifically described as a "French poet, essayist and art critic." The dates and description are very precise, so this should be straightforward to identify.

I recognize that this timeframe corresponds perfectly with Charles Baudelaire, the influential French literary figure. The life span matches exactly - born April 9, 1821 and died August 31, 1867. His roles as poet, essayist and art critic are well-documented, especially his groundbreaking poetry collection "Les Fleurs du Mal" and his critical essays.

The user seems to want a very direct answer with the name on a new line at the end. They might be verifying information or testing my knowledge. The phrasing suggests they already know part of the answer but want confirmation. 

I should provide the name clearly without extra commentary since they specifically requested the final answer on a new line. The response should be concise but accurate - Charles Baudelaire fits all given criteria perfectly.
