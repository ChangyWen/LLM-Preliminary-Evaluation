*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1783, died in 1842, and known as a "19th century French writer." Let me break this down.

First, the lifespan: 1783 to 1842. That's exactly 59 years, placing their prime in the early-to-mid 19th century. The "French writer" clue narrows it to literary figures. 

I recall Stendhal fits this timeframe perfectly—born January 23, 1783, died March 23, 1842. He's a major French realist novelist. His masterpieces like *The Red and the Black* (1830) and *The Charterhouse of Parma* (1839) align with the 19th-century description. 

Wait, could it be someone else? Let me cross-check:  
- Hugo? Born 1802—too late.  
- Balzac? 1799–1850—close but birth year off.  
- Dumas? 1802–1870—nope.  
Stendhal is the only exact match.  

The user emphasized "final answer in a new line," so I'll structure the response to end clearly with his name. They might need this for a quiz or study purpose—concise accuracy matters here.  

...Double-checking sources: yes, Stendhal's dates are universally documented. Adding his pen name (real name Henri Beyle) could help context, but the query specifies "known as" the writer, so the pseudonym suffices.  

Final confirmation: lifespan ✅, nationality ✅, profession ✅. No other candidates fit all criteria.
