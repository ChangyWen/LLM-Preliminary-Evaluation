Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1842, died in 1898, and known as a French Symbolist poet. 

First, I need to recall key Symbolist poets from that era. Rimbaud comes to mind immediately—he fits the birth and death years perfectly. Let me double-check those dates: yes, Rimbaud was born October 20, 1842, and died November 10, 1898. 

The user seems to want a precise answer, probably for a quiz or study purpose. They specifically requested the final answer on a new line, so they value clarity. 

I wonder if they're a student researching poetry or just someone curious about literary history. Either way, I should keep it factual but add a tiny bit of context—like mentioning his famous work "Le Bateau Ivre"—to make it more helpful. 

No need to overcomplicate; Rimbaud is the clear match. I'll confirm his Symbolist role and format the answer as instructed.
