*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1896 and died in 1940, specifically described as an "Italian Marshal of the Air Force and minister." I need to recall Italian military history from that era. The dates point to someone active during the interwar period and World War II.

The key details are: Italian nationality, Air Force Marshal, and a ministerial position. The timeframe aligns with Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime. I remember that Italo Balbo was a prominent figure in Italy's aviation history. He was born in 1896 and died in 1940. Balbo was indeed made Marshal of the Air Force, a high military rank, and served as the Air Minister, which fits the "minister" part of the description.

His death in 1940 was notableâ€”it happened during World War II when his plane was shot down, possibly by friendly fire. That adds context to why his lifespan ended abruptly. The user might be researching for a history project, a quiz, or just personal curiosity, so I should provide accurate, concise information.

The user emphasized ending with the answer on a new line, so I'll structure my response to build up to that. I'll confirm it's Italo Balbo without extra fluff at the end. This approach keeps it helpful and direct, addressing their query efficiently.
