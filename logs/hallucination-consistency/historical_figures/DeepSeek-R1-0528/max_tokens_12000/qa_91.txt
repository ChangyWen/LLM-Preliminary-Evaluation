*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a historical figure who:
 - Born in 1800
 - Died in 1849
 - Known as the 'Slovene national poet'
 - A Carniolan Romantic poet of Slovene descent

 The most famous Slovene poet of the Romantic era who fits this description is France Prešeren.

 Let's verify the dates:
   - Born: December 3, 1800
   - Died: February 8, 1849

 He is indeed considered the national poet of Slovenia and was from Carniola (a historical region that is now part of Slovenia).

 Therefore, the answer is France Prešeren.
