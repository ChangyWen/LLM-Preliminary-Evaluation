*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1899, died in 1943, and known as a French resistance fighter and civil servant. This seems straightforward, but I need to recall the key details accurately.

The birth year is 1899 and death in 1943 - that's a specific timeframe. I know World War II was raging during that period, and the French Resistance was active against Nazi occupation. The person must have been involved in that movement.

I'm thinking of Jean Moulin. He was born on June 20, 1899, and died on July 8, 1943. He's famous for his role in unifying the French Resistance groups under Charles de Gaulle's leadership during World War II. Before that, he worked as a civil servant, serving as a préfet (a high-ranking administrative official) in various French departments.

The user mentioned "civil servant," which fits Moulin's pre-war career. And "French resistance fighter" aligns perfectly with his wartime activities. I should confirm there aren't other prominent figures matching these exact dates and descriptions - but Moulin is the most iconic one.

The user wants the final answer on a new line at the end. So I'll structure my response to provide context first, then clearly state the answer as requested. This approach educates while directly addressing the query. The user might be a student, researcher, or just someone curious about history - either way, accuracy is crucial. I'll make sure to double-check my facts to avoid any mistakes.
