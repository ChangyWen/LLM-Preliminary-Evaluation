*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for an ancient Greek philosopher born in 427 BC and died in 347 BC.
 Note: The years are given with a negative sign, which is a common way to denote BC (Before Christ) years.
 The birth year: -427 = 427 BC
 The death year: -347 = 347 BC

 We know that Plato, the famous Greek philosopher, was born around 427/428 BC and died in 347 BC.

 Let's check:
   - Plato was a student of Socrates and teacher of Aristotle.
   - His life span: approximately 427/428 BC to 347 BC.

 Therefore, the historical figure is Plato.

 Final answer:
