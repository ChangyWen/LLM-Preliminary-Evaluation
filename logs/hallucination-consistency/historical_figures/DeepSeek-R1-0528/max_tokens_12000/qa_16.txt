Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1188, died in 1252, described as a Spanish princess and saint who became queen consort of France. 

Hmm, let me recall European royal history... The dates point to the early 13th century. Spanish princess married to French royalty... Ah! That must be Blanche of Castile. She was daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Eleanor of England, born exactly in 1188. 

Checking the death year - yes, she passed in 1252. Her title as Queen Consort of France came through marriage to Louis VIII. The "saint" part is interesting though - she's beatified but not fully canonized, though many refer to her as Saint Blanche informally due to her piety. 

The user seems to need precise identification, probably for academic or trivia purposes. They specifically requested the answer on a new final line, so I'll format it cleanly. No extra facts needed unless asked - just the name as instructed. 

*Double-checking sources mentally*: Birth/death years match, Castile is Spanish kingdom, queenship confirmed, religious veneration documented. All criteria satisfied. 

Final answer locked in.
