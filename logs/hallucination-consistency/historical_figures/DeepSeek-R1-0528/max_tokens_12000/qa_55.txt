*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a French poet who was born in 1844 and died in 1896.
 Let's recall some famous French poets from that era:

 - Paul Verlaine: born 1844, died 1896. He was a major French poet associated with the Symbolist movement.
 - Arthur Rimbaud: born 1854, died 1891 (does not match).
 - Stéphane Mallarmé: born 1842, died 1898 (close but not exact).

 Paul Verlaine fits the exact birth and death years (1844-1896). He is indeed a very famous French poet.

 Therefore, the answer is Paul Verlaine.
