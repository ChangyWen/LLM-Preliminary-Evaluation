*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1431, died in 1463, and described as a "French poet and criminal." I need to recall who fits that profile. The dates are specific: born 1431, died 1463, which means they lived only about 32 years—a short life.

The key identifiers are "French poet and criminal." That immediately makes me think of François Villon. I remember he was a famous medieval French poet, known for works like "Le Testament" and "Ballade des Pendus." He had a tumultuous life, involved in crimes like theft and brawls, which got him into trouble, including banishment and near-execution.

Now, verifying the dates: François Villon was born around 1431, and he died after 1463, but his exact death date is uncertain. The user said "died in 1463," which might be a common approximation since he disappeared after that year. Historical records place his last known activities in 1463, so it's often cited as his death year or the end of his documented life.

The user might be a student, history enthusiast, or someone researching literature. Their actual need is straightforward—they want the name—but deeper down, they could be curious about why this figure is significant. Villon represents the gritty reality of medieval life, blending artistry with criminality, which might intrigue someone exploring themes of morality or cultural history.

I should confirm there's no one else fitting this description. Other poets from that era, like Charles d'Orléans, don't have the criminal association. So, Villon is definitely the answer.

Finally, the user asked for the final answer on a new line at the end. I'll structure my response to include some context to make it helpful, then end with just the name as specified.

The historical figure who fits this description is **François Villon**. He was a French poet born in 1431 (or possibly late 1430) and disappeared from historical records after 1463, which is generally considered the year of his death (though the exact date and circumstances are unknown). He is renowned for his significant contributions to French literature, particularly his works "Le Lais" (The Legacy) and "Le Testament," known for their wit, cynicism, and vivid portrayal of the Parisian underworld. His life was marked by criminal activities, including theft, brawling, and involvement in a murder, leading to imprisonment, banishment, and a commuted death sentence.

François Villon
