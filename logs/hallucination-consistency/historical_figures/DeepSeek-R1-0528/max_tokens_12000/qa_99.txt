*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1917 and died in 1984, specifically described as an "Indian Prime Minister and politician." Let me verify the key details first. 

The lifespan matches Indira Gandhi perfectly - she was indeed born on November 19, 1917, and died on October 31, 1984. The "Indian Prime Minister" identifier is crucial here since she served two terms (1966-1977 and 1980-1984). 

Hmm, the user's phrasing suggests they might have partial information from a source like an encyclopedia snippet ("known for 'Indian Prime Minister and politician...'"). They likely just need confirmation rather than deep analysis. 

Wait - should I double-check for possible confusion with Mahatma Gandhi? No, his dates (1869-1948) don't match. Rajiv Gandhi? He became PM after 1984. Definitely Indira. 

The request for a "final answer in a new line" implies this could be for a quiz or quick reference. I'll keep the response concise but add minimal context since the user didn't ask for details. Though I wonder if they're testing my fact-checking ability... 

*Mental note*: Avoid mentioning controversial aspects (Emergency period, assassination) unless asked. Strictly factual. 

Final verification: Cross-referencing dates with reliable sources confirms Indira Gandhi is the only Indian PM fitting this timeframe. Response locked in.
