*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a French tragedian born in 1606 and died in 1684.
 The most famous French tragedian of that era is Pierre Corneille, but let's check the dates:
   - Pierre Corneille: born June 6, 1606, died October 1, 1684.
   - Jean Racine, another famous tragedian, was born in 1639 and died in 1699, so doesn't fit.

 Therefore, the answer should be Pierre Corneille.
