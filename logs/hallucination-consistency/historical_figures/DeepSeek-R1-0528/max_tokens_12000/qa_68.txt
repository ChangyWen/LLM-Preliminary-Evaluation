*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a Chilean politician and President who was born in 1858 and died in 1930.
 The key is that he was President of Chile during that time frame. We need to recall who among the Chilean presidents fits these dates.

 Let's think about the presidents of Chile around that period:

 - Arturo Alessandri Palma: He was president in two non-consecutive terms (1920-1925 and 1932-1938). However, he was born in 1868 and died in 1950. Doesn't match.

 - Pedro Montt: He was president from 1906 to 1910. He was born in 1849 and died in 1910. Doesn't match.

 - Emiliano Figueroa: He was president from 1925 to 1927. He was born in 1866 and died in 1931. Close but the death year is 1931, not 1930. Also, birth year is 1866.

 - Ramón Barros Luco: He was president from 1910 to 1915. He was born in 1835 and died in 1919. Doesn't match.

 - Germán Riesco: President from 1901 to 1906. Born in 1854, died in 1916. Doesn't match.

 - Juan Luis Sanfuentes: President from 1915 to 1920. Born in 1858 and died in 1930. That matches!

 Let me double-check:
   Juan Luis Sanfuentes Andonaegui:
     Born: December 27, 1858
     Died: July 16, 1930

 He was the President of Chile from 1915 to 1920.

 Therefore, the historical figure we are looking for is Juan Luis Sanfuentes.

Final answer:
Juan Luis Sanfuentes
