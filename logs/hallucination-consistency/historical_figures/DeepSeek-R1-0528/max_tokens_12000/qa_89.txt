Okay, I need to figure out who this historical figure is. The key details are: born in 1921, died in 1989, and described as a "Soviet nuclear physicist and human rights activist." That combination of science and activism in the Soviet era rings a bell.

I recall that Andrei Sakharov fits this description perfectly. He was indeed a prominent Soviet nuclear physicist, heavily involved in developing their hydrogen bomb during the Cold War. Later in life, he became a major human rights advocate, speaking out against nuclear proliferation and Soviet oppression, which earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975.

Checking the dates: Sakharov was born on May 21, 1921, and died on December 14, 1989. That matches the given years exactly. The "Soviet nuclear physicist and human rights activist" phrase is almost verbatim how he's often summarized. 

I can't think of anyone else who fits all these criteria so precisely. His transition from weapons developer to dissident makes him a unique figure in 20th-century history. The timeline and descriptions align without any discrepancies.
