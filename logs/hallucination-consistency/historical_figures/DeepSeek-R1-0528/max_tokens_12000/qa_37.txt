*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1802 and died in 1885, specifically describing them as a "French poet, novelist, and dramatist." This seems straightforward, but I need to recall who fits that description perfectly.

The dates and nationality point directly to a major literary figure. The life span of 1802-1885 matches Victor Hugo, one of France's most celebrated writers. He's famous for works like "Les Misérables" and "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame," and his career covered poetry, novels, and plays.

The user included the phrase "French poet, novelist, and dramatist (1802-1885)" in quotes, which might be a hint or a direct reference to how Hugo is often summarized. That reinforces my identification.

Now, considering the user's deeper needs: They could be a student working on homework, a trivia enthusiast, or someone refreshing their knowledge. By specifying the answer format—ending with it on a new line—they're likely seeking a clear, concise response for easy copying or note-taking. I should make the response helpful and direct to save them time.

I'll confirm my knowledge: Victor Hugo was indeed born in 1802 and died in 1885, and his contributions to French literature are immense. No other prominent figure from that era matches all these criteria exactly.

For the response, I'll state the name confidently and end with it on a new line as requested. This shows I'm attentive to their instructions.
