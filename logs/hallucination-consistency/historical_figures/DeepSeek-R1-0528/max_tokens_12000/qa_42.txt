Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1877, died in 1960, and described as a "Chilean army officer and political figure." I need to recall who this might be.

I know that Carlos Ibáñez del Campo fits these details perfectly. He was born in 1877 and died in 1960, and he was deeply involved in Chilean military and politics. He even served as President of Chile twice, which matches the "political figure" part.

The user specifically wants the answer on a new line at the end, so I should structure my response to provide context first and then clearly state the name.

This seems like a straightforward historical query, so I'll keep my response concise and informative to meet the user's needs.
