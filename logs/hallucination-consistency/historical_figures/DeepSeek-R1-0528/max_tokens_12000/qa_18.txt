*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure from Chile born in 1915 and died in 2006, described as a "General, politician." That immediately makes me think of Augusto Pinochet, who was a prominent military leader and dictator in Chile. Let me verify those dates: Pinochet was born on November 25, 1915, and died on December 10, 2006. That matches perfectly with the given years. 

The user specifically mentions "General, politician of Chile (1915-2006)" in quotes, which is a direct reference to Pinochet's roles. He led the 1973 military coup that overthrew Salvador Allende and ruled Chile as a dictator until 1990. His regime was marked by human rights abuses, which might be why the user is askingâ€”perhaps for historical research or education. 

I should ensure my answer is factual and concise, since the user wants the final answer clearly stated at the end. No need for extra details unless asked, but I'll include a brief confirmation in the response to show accuracy. 

The user seems to want a straightforward identification, likely for quick reference. I'll end with just the name on a new line as instructed.
