Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 69 BCE, died in 30 BCE, and known as the last active pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt. 

Hmm, the negative years are clearly BCE dates - that's a common notation in historical contexts. The Ptolemaic dynasty was the Greek ruling family of Egypt after Alexander the Great. 

The lifespan immediately makes me think of Cleopatra VII, but let me double-check the dates. Born 69 BCE, died 30 BCE - yes, that matches Cleopatra's lifetime perfectly. She famously ruled Egypt and had relationships with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. 

The "last active pharaoh" description is particularly accurate because after her death, Egypt became a Roman province. Her son Caesarion briefly succeeded her but was executed almost immediately, so he doesn't count as an "active" ruler. 

The user seems to want a very concise answer with the final name on a separate line. Probably testing specific knowledge or maybe preparing for some quiz. I'll keep the explanation brief but clear before giving the requested format. 

Interesting they used negative years instead of BCE - perhaps coming from a programming/mathematical background? But the question itself is straightforward historical fact. 

Final verification: yes, Cleopatra VII Philopator is unquestionably the answer. Born 69 BCE, died 30 BCE, last ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt before Roman annexation.

The historical figure born in 69 BCE (year -69), who died in 30 BCE (year -30), and is known as the **last active pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt**, is **Cleopatra VII Philopator**.

She ruled Egypt from 51 BCE until her death in 30 BCE, forming alliances with Julius Caesar and later Mark Antony. Her defeat by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) ended Ptolemaic rule and marked Egypt's annexation into the Roman Empire.
