Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1162 and died in 1227, specifically known as the founder and first khan of the Mongol Empire. I need to recall who this is. 

Hmm, the years 1162 to 1227 immediately point to Genghis Khan. He was born around that time and died in 1227, and he's famous for unifying the Mongol tribes and establishing the Mongol Empire. 

The user wants the answer in a new line at the end, so I should structure my response to end with just the name. They might be testing for accuracy or studying history—perhaps for a quiz or personal knowledge. 

I'll confirm the details: Genghis Khan fits perfectly—founded the empire, became its first Great Khan. No other figure matches this description. 

Finally, I'll provide a concise answer to meet their request, ensuring it's clear and direct. This should satisfy their need efficiently.
