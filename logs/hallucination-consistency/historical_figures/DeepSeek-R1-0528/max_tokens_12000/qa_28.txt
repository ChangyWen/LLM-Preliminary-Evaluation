Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure who was born in 1911, died in 1982, and is known as "President of Chile (1911-1982)." That seems off because the person lived from 1911 to 1982, so they couldn't have been president for that entire span. I need to think about who this could be.

First, I recall that Salvador Allende was a famous Chilean president. He was born in 1908, not 1911, so that doesn't match. Wait, no, that's incorrectâ€”I should double-check my facts. Actually, Salvador Allende was born in 1908 and died in 1973 during the coup. So, not him.

Now, thinking about other presidents: Augusto Pinochet comes to mind. He was a military dictator of Chile, and I believe he was born in 1915 and died in 2006. That doesn't fit either. 

Let me focus on the dates: born in 1911, died in 1982. Who could that be? I remember Eduardo Frei Montalva. He was a key political figure in Chile, serving as president from 1964 to 1970. His birth year is 1911, and he died in 1982. That matches perfectly. 

The user mentioned "President of Chile (1911-1982)," which might be a misphrasing. It probably means he lived during those years, not that he was president for that long. His actual presidency was from 1964 to 1970. So, Eduardo Frei Montalva is the correct answer.

I should confirm this: yes, born on January 16, 1911, and died on January 22, 1982. He was a Christian Democrat and played a big role in Chile's history, especially before the Allende era.

Now, the user wants the final answer on a new line at the end. I'll structure my response to explain the reasoning clearly, then provide the name as specified. This way, it's helpful and accurate. 

The user might have made a mistake with the dates or the description, but based on the info, Frei is the match. I'll make sure to clarify that in my response to avoid confusion.

The historical figure you're referring to is **Eduardo Frei Montalva**.  

*   He was born on January 16, 1911.
*   He served as the **President of Chile from 1964 to 1970**.
*   He died on January 22, 1982.

The description "President of Chile (1911-1982)" is likely a misphrasing meaning he lived during those years (1911-1982) and was President (specifically 1964-1970), not that he held the office for the entire 71-year period.

Eduardo Frei Montalva
