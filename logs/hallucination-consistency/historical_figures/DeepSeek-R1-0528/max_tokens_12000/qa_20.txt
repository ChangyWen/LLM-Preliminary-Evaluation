*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a Czech association football player born in 1904 and died in 1996.
 Let's recall some famous Czech footballers from that era. One of the most notable is Oldřich Nejedlý, but he was born in 1909 and died in 1990, which doesn't match.

 Another prominent player is Josef Bican, but he was born in 1913 and died in 2001.

 Let me think again. Another possibility is František Plánička. He was born on June 2, 1904, and died on July 20, 1996. He was a famous Czechoslovak football goalkeeper and captain of the Czechoslovakia national team. He played in the 1934 World Cup, where they reached the final.

 Therefore, the answer should be František Plánička.

 Final answer:
 František Plánička
