*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1599 and died in 1660, specifically described as a "Spanish painter." I need to recall prominent Spanish painters from that era. The dates 1599-1660 immediately make me think of Diego Velázquez, one of the most famous painters of the Spanish Golden Age. 

Let me verify the dates: Velázquez was indeed born in 1599 in Seville and died in 1660 in Madrid. That matches perfectly. His masterpieces like "Las Meninas" and portraits of the Spanish royal family cement his status as the definitive Spanish painter of that period. 

The user seems to want a straightforward identification, possibly for quick reference or verification. They even specified formatting with the answer on a new line, suggesting they might be copying this for notes or a project. I'll keep it concise but accurate. 

Hmm, just to be thorough, are there any other Spanish painters fitting these dates? Francisco de Zurbarán (1598-1664) is close but the birth year doesn't align perfectly. Jusepe de Ribera (1591-1652) is slightly off too. Velázquez remains the exact match. 

I'll confirm Velázquez as the answer and follow the formatting request precisely. No need for extra details unless asked—the query is very specific. 

Final Answer: 
Diego Velázquez
