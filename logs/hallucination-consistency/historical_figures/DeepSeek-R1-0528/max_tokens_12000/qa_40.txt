*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1719, died in 1786, and known as a French horticulturalist. The description is very specific, so I need to recall who fits this timeline and profession. I know that horticulture involves gardening and plant cultivation, so this person must be famous in that field.

The years 1719 to 1786 match a well-known figure in botanical history. I think it's André Le Nôtre, but let me double-check. Le Nôtre designed the gardens at Versailles, but he lived from 1613 to 1700—that's too early. So, that can't be right.

Another name comes to mind: Bernard de Jussieu. He was a French botanist active in the 18th century. Born in 1699? No, that doesn't align. I need to think carefully.

I remember that the most prominent French horticulturalist from that era is André Michaux. He was born in 1746 and died in 1802—not matching. That's off by decades. I'm getting confused.

Perhaps it's someone less obvious. I recall that Michel Adanson was a botanist born in 1727, still not 1719. This is trickier than I thought.

Wait, I think I have it: Antoine Laurent de Jussieu? Born in 1748, died in 1836. No, too late. His uncle Bernard was born earlier, but in 1699.

I need to search my knowledge base. I believe the correct person is Claude Richard. But I'm not sure. Let me think systematically.

Actually, upon reflection, the most famous French horticulturalist with those exact dates is André Michaux's father or something? No.

Finally, it hits me: it's Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau. He was a French horticulturalist and scientist, born in 1700? That's close but not exact.

1700 is very close to 1719, but it's not a match. I should verify the dates.

I recall that Duhamel du Monceau was born in 1700 and died in 1782. 1782 is not 1786, so that's incorrect.

This is frustrating. I need to get it right. Let me think of Jean-Baptiste de La Quintinie. He was born in 1626 and died in 1688—way too early.

Perhaps the user means André Le Nôtre, but his dates are wrong. No, I have to stick to the facts.

I think I've got it: the person is André Thouin. He was born in 1747 and died in 1824. Still not matching.

Another name: Pierre-Joseph Redouté, the famous flower painter, was born in 1759. Too late.

This is taking too long. I need to recall that the standard reference points to a specific individual. I believe it's Claude Richard (1705–1784), but 1705 isn't 1719.

1705 to 1784 is close but not exact. The user specified 1719 to 1786.

I remember now: it's Antoine Nicolas Duchesne. He was born in 1747 and died in 1827. Not matching.

Perhaps it's a woman? Like Jeanne Baret, but she was a botanist explorer, born around 1740.

I think I found it: the correct historical figure is Bernard de Jussieu, but his birth is 1699. Close, but not 1719.

Upon second thought, Bernard de Jussieu's brother Antoine was born in 1686. No.

I recall that in French horticulture, one key figure is André Michaux's collaborator, but I'm missing it.

Finally, after racking my brain, I realize it's Louis-Claude Richard. He was born in 1754, too late.

This is embarrassing. I should know this. Let me think about the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. Many worked there.

Ah, I've got it: the person is André Thouin, but dates don't match. Wait, his father was Jean-André Thouin, born 1719? I'm not sure.

Upon accurate recollection, the historical figure who fits perfectly is Claude Richard, but with adjusted dates? No.

I believe the answer is Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, but his dates are 1748-1836.

I need to accept that I might be wrong and look for the most logical match. The user said "French horticulturalist (1719-1786)", so perhaps it's a common reference.

I remember now: it's Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau, and his death was in 1782, not 1786. Close, but not exact. Maybe the user misremembered.

But in standard history, Duhamel du Monceau is often cited with 1700-1782.

Another possibility: it could be André Michaux, but his birth is 1746.

I think I have it: the person is Bernard de Jussieu, and the dates are approximate. Born 1699, died 1777. Not matching.

Perhaps it's a lesser-known figure. I recall that in encyclopedias, the name that comes up is Claude Richard (1705–1784), but again, not exact.

I found a better match: it's Pierre Poivre, the French horticulturalist who introduced spices. He was born in 1719 and died in 1786. Yes! That's it.

Confirming: Pierre Poivre, born August 23, 1719, died January 6, 1786. He was a missionary and botanist known for horticultural work, especially with spices like nutmeg and clove.

That fits perfectly. I should have thought of him earlier. His work in Mauritius and Isle de France (now Réunion) was significant.

So, the answer is Pierre Poivre. I'll present it clearly at the end as requested.
