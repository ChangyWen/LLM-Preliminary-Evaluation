Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1790, died in 1832, and known as a "French classical scholar." Let me think carefully about this.

I need to recall prominent French classical scholars from that time period. The key dates are 1790 for birth and 1832 for death. That would make them 42 years old when they passed away - quite young for such scholarly achievements.

The most famous French classical scholar that fits this timeline is Jean-François Champollion. Let me verify the dates: he was born on December 23, 1790, and died on March 4, 1832. Perfect match. 

Now, why is he significant? Ah yes, he's the brilliant mind who deciphered the Rosetta Stone, unlocking the secrets of Egyptian hieroglyphs. That was a monumental achievement in classical scholarship and Egyptology. 

The user specifically wants the answer on a new line at the end, so I'll make sure to format my response that way. They seem to be testing historical knowledge - perhaps a student or trivia enthusiast. I should provide enough context to show why Champollion matters beyond just the dates. 

I'll briefly explain his Rosetta Stone breakthrough since that's his defining contribution. The response should be precise but educational. And of course, end with just the name on a separate line as requested.
