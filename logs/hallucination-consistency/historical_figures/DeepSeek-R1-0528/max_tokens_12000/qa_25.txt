Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1713, died in 1784, and known as a French Enlightenment philosopher and encyclopædist. 

Hmm, those dates immediately make me think of the Enlightenment period in France. The lifespan perfectly matches Diderot - born 1713, died 1784. And the "encyclopædist" part is a huge clue because he co-edited the Encyclopédie. 

The user seems to want a very straightforward answer, probably for quick reference. They specifically asked for the final answer on a new line, so they likely need it for copying or note-taking. 

I recall Diderot wasn't just an encyclopedist though - he was also a radical philosopher who challenged the Church and monarchy. But since the user only asked for identification, I'll keep it concise. 

Better double-check those dates... yes, Encyclopædia Britannica confirms 1713-1784. And his role as chief editor of the Encyclopédie is undisputed. 

The request for a separate line at the end suggests this might be for some structured format. I'll make sure to deliver exactly as asked - clear identification followed by a clean line break.
