*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1868, died in 1950, and known as a Chilean politician and President. Let me think about Chilean presidents during that timeframe. 

The lifespan fits perfectly with Arturo Alessandri Palma - he was indeed born in 1868 and died in 1950. He served two non-consecutive terms as President of Chile, first from 1920-1925 and then again from 1932-1938. 

I recall he was a major figure in Chilean politics, known as "The Lion of Tarapacá" for his strong oratory skills. His presidency was significant for social reforms and constitutional changes. 

The user seems to want a straightforward answer with the name at the end, so I'll keep the response concise. They might be studying Latin American history or working on a trivia question. 

I should confirm there aren't other Chilean presidents with matching dates - no, Alessandri is the clear match. His son Jorge also became president later, but the dates don't align. 

The request for a final answer on a new line suggests this might be for quick reference, so I'll format accordingly.
