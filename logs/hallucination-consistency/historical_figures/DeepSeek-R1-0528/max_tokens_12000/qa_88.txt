*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a Russian author born in 1821 and died in 1881.
 The most famous Russian author with these birth and death years is Fyodor Dostoevsky.
 Let's confirm:
   Born: November 11, 1821
   Died: February 9, 1881

 However, note that the question asks for the name and then to put the final answer on a new line at the end.

 But wait, let's double-check: Leo Tolstoy was born in 1828 and died in 1910, so that doesn't match.
 Ivan Turgenev was born in 1818 and died in 1883, so that's not exact.
 Nikolai Gogol was born in 1809 and died in 1852.

 Therefore, Dostoevsky is the one.

 Final Answer:
Fyodor Dostoevsky
