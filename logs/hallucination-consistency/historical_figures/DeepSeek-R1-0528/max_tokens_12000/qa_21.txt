Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1949, died in 2002, known first as an American pornographic actress and later as an anti-porn activist. 

Hmm, this description immediately brings Linda Boreman to mind—she's famously known by her stage name Linda Lovelace. Let me verify the details to be thorough. 

Born in 1949? Check—January 10, 1949. Died in 2002? Yes, April 22, 2002. Her trajectory fits perfectly: she starred in "Deep Throat" (1972), then became a vocal critic of the porn industry, even testifying before Congress. 

The user seems to want a precise answer, so I'll keep it concise. They specifically asked for the final answer on a new line—probably for clarity or copying purposes. Maybe they're researching or just curious about cultural history. 

I wonder if they're aware of her activism's impact or just connecting dots between birth/death years. Either way, the answer is unambiguous here. No need for extra fluff—just facts. 

Final confirmation: Linda Boreman (Lovelace) matches all criteria. I'll present it cleanly as requested.
