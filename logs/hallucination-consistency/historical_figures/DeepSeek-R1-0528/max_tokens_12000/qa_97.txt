*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1265 and died in 1321, specifically described as an "Italian poet." I need to recall who this might be. The dates immediately ring a bell—1265 to 1321—and the description points to a famous Italian poet. I remember Dante Alighieri, the author of "The Divine Comedy," fits perfectly. He's one of the most iconic figures in literature, so this seems straightforward.

Now, the user wants the final answer on a new line at the end. That means I should structure my response carefully. I'll start by confirming the details to show I'm thorough, then end with just the name as instructed. 

Looking deeper, why is the user asking this? It could be for a school assignment, trivia, or personal interest. Since the query is precise, they might be verifying facts or testing knowledge. I should keep it concise and accurate to build trust. 

No signs of confusion or complexity here—just a direct question. I'll wrap up with Dante Alighieri as the answer, making sure it's clear and standalone.
