Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1564, died in 1616, and known as an English playwright and poet. That's clearly pointing to William Shakespeare. 

Hmm, the user specifically requests the final answer on a new line at the end. They seem to want a direct response without extra fluff, but since they're asking about Shakespeare, maybe they're testing basic knowledge or confirming facts. 

I recall Shakespeare's exact lifespan is April 23, 1564 to April 23, 1616 - the dates match perfectly. His titles like "Bard of Avon" and famous works (Hamlet, sonnets etc.) cement his identity. 

The user didn't ask for elaboration, so I'll keep it concise. But since Shakespeare is such a giant figure, I'll include one defining descriptor ("widely regarded as...") to subtly acknowledge his significance beyond just the raw dates. 

Final answer will be isolated as instructed. No need for sources here - this is universally accepted historical fact. User seems efficient, so I'll mirror that tone.
