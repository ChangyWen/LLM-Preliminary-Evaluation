What is the name of the historical figure who was born in 1879, died in 1955, and is known for 'German-born theoretical physicist; developer of the theory of relativity (1879–1955)'? Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.

Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1879 and died in 1955, specifically described as a "German-born theoretical physicist" and "developer of the theory of relativity." That sounds very familiar—it's Albert Einstein! The dates match perfectly: he was born on March 14, 1879, and passed away on April 18, 1955. His contributions to physics, especially the theory of relativity, revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. I should confirm the details to be accurate. The description mentions "German-born," which is correct as he was born in Ulm, Germany, though he later became a Swiss and then American citizen. The theory of relativity includes both special and general relativity, making him one of the most famous scientists ever. The user wants the final answer on a new line at the end, so I'll structure my response to build up to that. I'll provide a bit more context to make it helpful and educational, as that might be why they're asking—perhaps for a school project or general knowledge. Finally, I'll end with "Albert Einstein" as specified.
