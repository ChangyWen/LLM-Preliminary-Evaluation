Okay, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1921, died in 1981, and known as a French singer-songwriter and poet. That's quite specific. 

Hmm, let me think about famous French cultural icons from that era. The lifespan immediately makes me consider post-war artists. The "singer-songwriter and poet" description is key - it suggests someone with literary depth, not just a pop singer. 

I recall Georges Brassens fits perfectly here. Born October 1921 in Sète, died October 1981. His witty, poetic lyrics revolutionized French chanson. Songs like "Les copains d'abord" became classics. 

Wait, should I double-check? Yes, his death date was definitely 1981 - I remember it was big news in France. And his birth year aligns with the interwar generation of artists. The user seems to want precise information, so accuracy is crucial. 

The request for a final answer on a new line suggests they might be testing me or compiling data. I'll keep it clean: just the name after confirmation. No extra fluff since they want efficiency. 

Brassens it is. His poetic style and guitar mastery make him unforgettable. Funny how his satirical songs still feel relevant today. User picked a great figure to ask about!
