*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure from medieval Russia, specifically someone born in 1360 and died in 1428, known as an artist. I need to recall my knowledge of Russian history and art. The key here is "medieval Russian artist" with those exact dates.

I remember that Andrei Rublev is one of the most famous medieval Russian icon painters. Let me verify the dates: he was born around 1360 and died in 1428 or possibly 1430, but sources often cite 1428 as his death year. That fits perfectly with the query.

The user emphasized "medieval Russian artist," which aligns with Rublev's work as an icon painter during that era. His most famous work is "The Trinity" icon, which is a masterpiece of Orthodox Christian art. He's celebrated for his contributions to Russian culture and is even canonized as a saint.

The user wants the final answer on a new line at the end. So, I should structure my response to provide context first, then give the name clearly. This shows I'm thorough and helpful, not just spitting out an answer.

I wonder why the user is asking this. Maybe they're a student researching history, an art enthusiast, or someone preparing for a quiz. By adding details about Rublev's significance, I'm making the response more engaging and educational, which could satisfy deeper interests in learning.

Finally, I'll ensure the answer is accurate and prominent, as requested. This way, I'm respecting their instructions while enhancing their understanding.
