Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 470 BCE and died in 399 BCE, described as an "ancient Greek philosopher." Let me recall the timeline of Greek philosophers.

The dates 470-399 BCE immediately point to Socrates. He's famously known for his contributions to philosophy and the Socratic method. His death year is particularly memorable because he was executed in 399 BCE after being sentenced to death by drinking hemlock. 

The user seems to be testing precise historical knowledge. They might be a student or history enthusiast wanting confirmation. The phrasing suggests they already suspect the answer but want verification. 

I should note that ancient dates use BCE (Before Common Era) notation, equivalent to BC. The negative years are standard in historical dating systems. 

The request for a final answer on a new line indicates they want clarity for possible copy-paste or quick reference. This is practical for educational purposes. 

I'll confirm Socrates with the exact dates and add context about his significance in Western philosophy to enrich the response, while keeping the direct answer cleanly formatted at the end as requested.
