Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1908, died in 1991, and described as an "American physicist and engineer." Hmm, those dates and descriptors immediately make me think of William Shockley. 

Let me verify the details mentally: Shockley was indeed born in 1910... wait, 1910? That doesn't match 1908. That's a problem. Maybe I'm confusing him with someone else. 

*Pauses to recall* Ah! Richard Feynman! He fits perfectly: born 1918... no, that's later. Wait, this is trickier than I thought. Let me systematically scan famous American physicists from that era. 

*Runs through mental list* Robert Oppenheimer? Born 1904 - close but not exact. Isidor Rabi? 1898. Hans Bethe? 1906 - still off. John Bardeen? 1908! And died 1991! And he's a physicist/engineer who co-invented the transistor. That must be it. 

But why did I initially think Shockley? Probably because Shockley was part of the same transistor team but has different dates (1910-1989). The user might be conflating them, but the dates point firmly to Bardeen. 

The user seems to want a precise factual answer - probably for a quiz or study purpose. They even requested the answer on a new line, suggesting they need it clearly isolated. Better double-check everything: 

- Bardeen: born May 23, 1908 ✅
- Died January 30, 1991 ✅
- American physicist ✅
- Electrical engineer by training ✅
- Only person to win two Nobel Prizes in physics (transistor + superconductivity) ✅

Yep, definitely John Bardeen. I'll make sure to present the answer cleanly as requested. Interesting how the mind jumps to more controversial figures like Shockley first - Bardeen deserves more recognition!

The historical figure who was born in 1908, died in 1991, and is known as an **American physicist and engineer** is **John Bardeen**. He was a pioneering physicist and electrical engineer, most famous for co-inventing the transistor and developing the theory of superconductivity. He remains the only person to have won the Nobel Prize in Physics twice (1956 and 1972).
