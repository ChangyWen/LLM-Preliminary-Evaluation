Okay, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1683, died in 1764, and known as a "French Baroque composer and music theorist." Let me think about this. 

First, I recall that the Baroque period in music was roughly from 1600 to 1750, so this person's lifespan fits perfectly within that era. The key clues are the specific birth and death years - 1683 to 1764 - which immediately make me think of Jean-Philippe Rameau. 

I remember Rameau was a major French composer of that time. He was born exactly in 1683 and died in 1764. Beyond composing, he was famous for his music theory work, especially his treatise on harmony. That matches the "music theorist" part of the description perfectly. 

The user seems to want a very precise answer - they even specified to put the final answer on a new line at the end. This suggests they might be testing knowledge or need it for some structured purpose. I should make sure to deliver exactly what they asked for without extra fluff at the end. 

While there were other Baroque composers, none match these exact dates and specialties. Lully was earlier, Couperin was contemporary but doesn't fit the death year. Rameau is unmistakably the correct answer here. 

I'll confirm the dates one more time in my memory: yes, 1683 birth in Dijon, 1764 death in Paris. And his dual legacy as both composer (of operas like "Hippolyte et Aricie") and theorist (with his revolutionary harmony concepts) makes him unique. 

The answer has to be Jean-Philippe Rameau. I'll present it cleanly as requested.

The historical figure who was born in 1683, died in 1764, and is known as a French Baroque composer and music theorist is **Jean-Philippe Rameau**.

Rameau was a pivotal figure in French music. His compositions, including operas like *Hippolyte et Aricie* and *Castor et Pollux*, defined the French Baroque style. His theoretical works, especially the *Trait√© de l'harmonie* (Treatise on Harmony, 1722), revolutionized music theory and form the basis of modern harmonic principles.
