Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1935, died in 1977, and known as an "American singer and actor." They also want my final answer on a new line at the end.

I know that 1935 to 1977 gives a lifespan of 42 years - that's quite young for death, so this person likely died prematurely. The key identifiers are their nationality and profession: American, singer, and actor. 

Recalling famous figures from that era, Elvis Presley comes to mind immediately. Let me double-check the dates: Elvis was born on January 8, 1935, and died on August 16, 1977 - perfect match. He's iconic as both a singer (the "King of Rock and Roll") and an actor who starred in many films.

The user specified the exact phrase "American singer and actor (1935–1977)" which is precisely how Elvis is often described. No other major celebrity fits these exact criteria - figures like Buddy Holly died earlier, while others like John Wayne lived longer.

The request for a standalone final answer suggests they might be testing precision or using this for some structured purpose. I'll confirm it's Elvis and present the answer clearly as requested.
