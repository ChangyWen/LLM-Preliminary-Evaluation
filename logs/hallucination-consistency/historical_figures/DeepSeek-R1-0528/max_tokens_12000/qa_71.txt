*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 384 BC and died in 322 BC, identified as an "ancient Greek philosopher." That's a very specific timeframe—let me mentally scan through major Greek philosophers. 

Plato comes to mind first, but his lifespan (428/427–348/347 BC) doesn't match. Socrates (470–399 BC) is too early. Then it clicks: Aristotle fits perfectly. Born 384 BC in Stagira, died 322 BC in Chalcis. The dates align exactly with the user's query. 

The user seems to want a straightforward answer—they even instructed to place the final answer on a new line. Probably verifying facts or doing homework. No emotional cues in the query, so I'll keep it precise. 

Wait—should I confirm the dating notation? The user used negative years ("-384"), which is standard for BCE dates. No need to overexplain unless asked. 

Final checks: Aristotle's key identifiers—student of Plato, teacher of Alexander the Great, wrote Nicomachean Ethics, etc.—but the user only requested the name and dates. No extra details required unless they follow up. 

*Mentally files away:* User values conciseness. Answer goes last line as instructed.
