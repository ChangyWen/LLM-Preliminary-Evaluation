Hmm, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1891, died in 1940, and known as a "Russian author." I need to recall famous Russian authors from that time period. The death year 1940 is particularly helpful because it was during World War II, which might narrow things down.

Let me think about major Russian authors... There's Leo Tolstoy, but he died in 1910. Fyodor Dostoevsky died in 1881. Anton Chekhov died in 1904. None of these match the dates. Then I remember Mikhail Bulgakov - he was born in 1891 and died in 1940. That fits perfectly.

Bulgakov is indeed known as a Russian author, famous for works like "The Master and Margarita" and "Heart of a Dog." He faced censorship under Stalin but is now considered one of the greats. This matches all the criteria: birth year 1891, death year 1940, and Russian authorship.

The user specifically asked me to put the final answer on a new line at the end, so I'll make sure to format my response that way. They might be testing my knowledge or working on a quiz, so accuracy is key. I'll provide the answer clearly and directly to meet their request.
