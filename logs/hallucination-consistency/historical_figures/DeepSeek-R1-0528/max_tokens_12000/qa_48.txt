Okay, the user is asking for a historical figure born in 1775, died in 1836, and described as a "French physicist and mathematician." Let me start by recalling prominent scientists from that era. 

The years 1775 to 1836 immediately make me think of the early 19th century. France produced many notable scientists during that period. The key clues here are the specific lifespan and the dual expertise in physics and mathematics. 

André-Marie Ampère comes to mind first. I remember he was born on January 20, 1775, and died on June 10, 1836. That fits perfectly. His contributions to electromagnetism are fundamental—he formulated Ampère's law and helped establish the field of electrodynamics. The unit of electric current, the ampere, is named after him, which underscores his lasting impact. 

But to be thorough, I should consider if there are other possibilities. Siméon Denis Poisson was also a French mathematician and physicist from that era, but his lifespan (1781–1840) doesn't match. Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857) is another candidate, but his birth year is too late. Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) is close but dies earlier than 1836. So Ampère remains the only exact match. 

The user might be testing historical knowledge or preparing for an exam. Since they asked for a "final answer" on a new line, they likely want a concise, unambiguous response. I'll confirm the dates once more: born 1775, died 1836—yes, Ampère fits. His work bridges physics and math, so the description is accurate. 

I'll present the answer clearly at the end, as requested. No need for extra details unless asked, but the reasoning ensures accuracy. 

Final Answer:  
André-Marie Ampère
