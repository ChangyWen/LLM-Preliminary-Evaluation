*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a Russian architect and painter who was born in 1890 and died in 1974.
 The most famous figure matching this description is Vladimir Tatlin.
 However, note that the question specifies "Russian architect and painter (1890-1974)".
 Let's verify:
   Vladimir Tatlin (1885-1953) does not match the years (born 1885, died 1953).
   Another possibility is Konstantin Melnikov (1890-1974), a Russian architect and painter.
   Konstantin Melnikov was born on August 3, 1890, and died on November 28, 1974.
   He is known for his avant-garde architecture in the Soviet Union and also painted.

 Therefore, the answer is Konstantin Melnikov.
