*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1927, died in 2010, and described as a "Dutch writer." I need to recall prominent Dutch authors fitting these dates. 

Harry Mulisch immediately comes to mind – he was a major figure in Dutch literature, born in 1927 and passed away in 2010. His works like "The Assault" and "The Discovery of Heaven" are internationally renowned. 

The user specifically wants the answer on a new line at the end, so I'll structure my response carefully. They might be researching literature or preparing for trivia – the concise phrasing suggests they value precision. 

I'll confirm Mulisch's details mentally: yes, 1927-2010, Dutch writer, no other candidates match as perfectly. The response should be straightforward but I'll add context about his significance since the user didn't specify needing brevity. 

Final output will be: [explanation] then the name alone on the last line. Clean and accurate.
