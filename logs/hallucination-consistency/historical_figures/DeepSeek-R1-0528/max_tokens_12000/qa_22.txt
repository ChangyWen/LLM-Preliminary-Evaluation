Okay, the user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1945, died in 1981, and described as a Jamaican singer, songwriter, and musician. 

First, I need to recall prominent Jamaican musicians from that era. The key details are the birth and death years – 1945 to 1981 – which immediately points to a relatively short lifespan. 

The most iconic Jamaican musician matching these dates is Bob Marley. Let me verify: born February 6, 1945, died May 11, 1981. Perfect match. 

His description fits too – legendary reggae artist, wrote classics like "No Woman, No Cry" and "Redemption Song," and was instrumental in popularizing reggae globally. 

The user seems to want a straightforward answer, probably for quick reference or a trivia question. They specifically asked for the final answer on a new line, so I'll keep the response concise after confirming the details. 

No other major Jamaican musicians from that exact timeframe come to mind, so Bob Marley is definitely the answer. I'll present it clearly as requested.
