Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1840, died in 1926, and known as a French Impressionist painter. That's a very specific timeframe and artistic movement. 

Hmm, Impressionism... let me recall the major artists. Monet comes to mind immediately - his lifespan matches perfectly (1840-1926), and he's literally the founder of French Impressionism. The dates are like a fingerprint here - no other major Impressionist fits this exact timeframe. Renoir was close but born 1841, Degas 1834... yeah, only Monet matches precisely.

Wait, the user included the exact phrase "French impressionist painter (1840-1926)" in quotes - almost like they're quoting a textbook or museum label. Smart framing. They probably already suspect it's Monet but want confirmation. 

The request for "final answer in a new line" suggests this might be for some structured use - maybe a quiz answer or filling a database. Should keep it clean and precise. 

*Double-checks art history knowledge*: Yep, Monet's Water Lilies, Haystacks series, the term "Impressionism" literally came from his painting "Impression, Sunrise"... no doubt about it. 

Will deliver the full name formally as requested: Oscar-Claude Monet. Some just say "Claude Monet" but full name feels more complete for historical records. 

User seems efficient - no small talk, just wants facts. Appreciate that. Will mirror their precision in response.
