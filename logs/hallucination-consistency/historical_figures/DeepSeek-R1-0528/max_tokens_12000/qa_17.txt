Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1921 and died in 1984, specifically described as a "Dutch footballer." They want me to provide the answer on a new line at the end of my response.

I need to recall famous Dutch footballers from that era. The key dates are 1921-1984. I remember that Abe Lenstra, a legendary Dutch footballer, was born in 1921. He died in 1984, which matches perfectly. He played for Heerenveen and the Netherlands national team, and he's often celebrated as one of the country's all-time greats.

The user specified "Dutch footballer (1921-1984)," so this should be straightforward. I should confirm if there are any other possibilities, but Abe Lenstra is the most prominent figure that fits. His career peaked in the 1940s and 1950s, making him a historical icon.

Now, thinking about the user's needs: they might be researching history, working on a quiz, or just curious. By asking for a clear answer format, they probably want efficiency and accuracy. I'll make sure my response is concise and ends with the name as instructed.

Finally, I'll structure my answer: first, explain who he is to add value, then on a new line, give just the name. That way, it's helpful and compliant.
