Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1622, died in 1673, and known as a French playwright and actor. Let me recall who that might be. 

Hmm... the dates 1622-1673 immediately make me think of Molière. He fits perfectly within that lifespan. Let me double-check: yes, Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (his real name) was born in January 1622 and died in February 1673. 

The user specifically mentions "French playwright and actor" - that's Molière's exact description. He founded the Illustre Théâtre company, wrote iconic comedies like Tartuffe and The Misanthrope, and often starred in his own plays. 

The request for a final answer on a new line suggests they might be testing knowledge or need it for quick reference. I'll confirm it's Molière and present it cleanly at the end. 

No need to overcomplicate - this is a straightforward historical ID question. Just need to deliver the accurate name with the requested formatting.
