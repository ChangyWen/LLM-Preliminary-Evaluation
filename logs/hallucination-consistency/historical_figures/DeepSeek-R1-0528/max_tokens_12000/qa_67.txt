Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure with specific details: born in 1879, died in 1953, and described as a Soviet politician who held key positions like general secretary of the Communist Party and premier of the Soviet Union. They've also included an odd discrepancy in the death year - it says "premier of the Soviet Union (1878-1953)" which has a birth year of 1878 instead of 1879.

I recognize this description immediately. The person in question is Joseph Stalin. He's one of the most prominent figures in 20th-century history, known for leading the Soviet Union through industrialization, World War II, and establishing a totalitarian regime. His actual birth date is December 18, 1878, in the Julian calendar, which corresponds to December 21, 1879, in the Gregorian calendar used today. That explains the confusion in the query: some sources list 1878 while others use 1879 for the Gregorian conversion. His death year is consistently 1953.

The user might be a student or history enthusiast seeking clarification. Perhaps they're confused about the conflicting dates and want to confirm the identity. I should address this discrepancy to prevent misunderstanding. They also requested the final answer on a new line, so I'll make sure to format that clearly.

Beyond the facts, the user could be trying to understand historical timelines or doing research. Stalin's era was complex, marked by both achievements and atrocities, so I'll stick to the objective details without bias. My response should be concise, educational, and end with the name as specified.

Finally, I'll wrap up with "Joseph Stalin" on a new line to fulfill their request perfectly.

The historical figure described is **Joseph Stalin**. 

Key points matching your query:
- Born: December 18, 1878 (Julian calendar) / December 21, 1879 (Gregorian calendar - widely used today).
- Died: March 5, 1953.
- Role: Soviet politician, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922-1952), and Premier of the Soviet Union (1941-1953).

The slight discrepancy in birth year (1878 vs. 1879) arises because Russia used the Julian calendar during Stalin's birth. The Gregorian date is December 21, 1879, which is the year most commonly cited.

Joseph Stalin  
(Note: His birth year is often listed as 1879 based on the Gregorian calendar conversion).
