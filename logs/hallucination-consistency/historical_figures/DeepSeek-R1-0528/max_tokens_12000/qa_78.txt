*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a Dutch writer and translator who was born in 1937 and died in 2012.
 Let's recall some notable Dutch literary figures. One prominent name that fits these criteria is Harry Mulisch.
 However, let's verify:
   Harry Mulisch was born on July 29, 1927, and died on October 30, 2010. That doesn't match.

 Another possibility: Cees Nooteboom.
   Cees Nooteboom was born on July 31, 1933. He is still alive as of 2023. So that doesn't match.

 Let's think about other writers. What about Gerard Reve?
   Gerard Reve: born December 14, 1923, died April 8, 2006. Doesn't match.

 What about Willem Frederik Hermans?
   Born: September 1, 1921, Died: April 27, 1995. Doesn't match.

 Let me think again. There is also Jan Wolkers.
   Jan Wolkers: born October 26, 1925, died October 19, 2007. Doesn't match.

 Another possibility: Hella Haasse?
   Hella Haasse: born February 2, 1918, died September 29, 2011. Doesn't match.

 Then I recall: there is a Dutch writer named Gerrit Komrij.
   Gerrit Komrij: born March 30, 1944, died July 5, 2012. The birth year doesn't match.

 Let me try a different approach. I remember that the famous Dutch poet and translator who passed away in 2012 and was born in 1937 is Rutger Kopland.

 Rutger Kopland (pseudonym of Rudi van den Hoofdakker) was born on August 4, 1934. He died on July 29, 2012. That's close but the birth year is 1934, not 1937.

 Wait, let's check the birth year again? 1934 is not 1937.

 What about Hans Warren? He was a Dutch poet and translator.
   Born: October 20, 1921, Died: December 19, 2001. Doesn't match.

 Then I remember: the writer we are looking for might be J. Bernlef.

 J. Bernlef (pseudonym of Hendrik Jan Marsman) was born on January 14, 1937, and died on October 29, 2012. He was a Dutch writer and translator.

 Let me confirm:
   Birth: January 14, 1937
   Death: October 29, 2012
   He was known for his work as a writer and translator.

 Yes, that matches.

 Therefore, the answer is J. Bernlef.

Final Answer:
J. Bernlef
