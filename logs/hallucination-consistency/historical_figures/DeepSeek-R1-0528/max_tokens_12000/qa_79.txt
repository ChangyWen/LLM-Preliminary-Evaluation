Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure with specific details: born in 1872, died in 1928, and known as a Norwegian explorer who was the first to reach the South Pole. Let me recall... that sounds like Roald Amundsen. I remember he led the first expedition to reach the South Pole in 1911. 

Hmm, the user seems to want a straightforward answer but also specifies the format—they want the final answer on a new line at the end. That's clear. Maybe they're testing factual recall or preparing for a quiz. 

I wonder if they're a student researching explorers or just curious about polar history. Either way, they've given precise parameters, so accuracy is key. No need for extra fluff—just verify the dates: yes, born December 16, 1872; died June 18, 1928. 

...And done. Answer locked in. Final output formatted as requested.
