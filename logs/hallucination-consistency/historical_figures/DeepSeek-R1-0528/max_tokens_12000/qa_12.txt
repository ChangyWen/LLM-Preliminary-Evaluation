Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1564 and died in 1642, described as an Italian mathematician, physicist, philosopher, and astronomer. Let me start by recalling key figures from that era. 

The birth year 1564 stands out because Galileo Galilei was born that year. His death in 1642 also matches. Galileo fits all the descriptors: Italian, and his contributions in math, physics, philosophy, and astronomy are well-known. 

I should double-check if there are other possibilities. Someone like Johannes Kepler was a contemporary but he was German, not Italian. Giordano Bruno was Italian but he died in 1600, so the death year doesn't match. Galileo's dates and nationality align perfectly. 

The user's request includes a specific format: final answer on a new line. They might be testing accuracy or need it for a project. Including the full name and years in the response ensures clarity. 

Also, considering the user might be a student or enthusiast, adding context about Galileo's achievements could be helpful. But since the query asks for just the name and answer format, keeping it concise meets their need. 

Finalizing: Galileo Galilei is the correct answer. Making sure to present it as requested.
