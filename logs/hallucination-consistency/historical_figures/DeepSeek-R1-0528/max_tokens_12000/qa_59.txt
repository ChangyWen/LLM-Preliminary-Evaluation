*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a Chilean politician who was born in 1898 and died in 1980.
 One of the most prominent Chilean political figures from that era is Salvador Allende, but note:
   - Salvador Allende was born on June 26, 1908, and died on September 11, 1973.
   - So he does not fit the given years.

 Another prominent figure is Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, but:
   - He was born on November 3, 1877, and died on April 28, 1960.

 Let's consider Eduardo Frei Montalva:
   - Born: January 16, 1911, died: January 22, 1982.

 Another possibility is Arturo Alessandri Palma, but:
   - Born: December 20, 1868, died: August 24, 1950.

 Now, let's think about Gabriel González Videla:
   - Born: November 22, 1898, died: August 22, 1980.

 Check the dates: 
   - Birth: 1898 (matches)
   - Death: 1980 (matches)

 Gabriel González Videla was a Chilean politician who served as the President of Chile from 1946 to 1952.

 Therefore, the answer is Gabriel González Videla.
