Okay, the user is asking for a historical figure born in 1888, died in 1976, and known as a French writer. Let me start by recalling famous French writers from that era. 

First, the lifespan: 1888 to 1976. That's 88 years, so the person lived through both World Wars and the mid-20th century. Key French writers born around 1888... Jean Cocteau comes to mind, but he died in 1963. Not matching. Louis Aragon? Born 1897, too late. 

Wait, Raymond Queneau? Born 1903. No. Then I remember Jean Giraudoux—1882 to 1944. Too early. Hmm, need someone who fits the exact dates. 

Suddenly, it clicks: Jean Paulhan. Born 1884? No. Wait, maybe I should think of Georges Bernanos. Born 1888? Let me check my mental database. Bernanos was born 1888, died 1948. Close but died too early. 

Another name: François Mauriac. Born 1885, died 1970. Not 1976. Jules Romains? Born 1885, died 1972. Still not. 

Then it hits me: Jean Paulhan again? No. Wait, Paul Morand? 1888–1976. Yes! Born March 1888, died July 1976. He was a diplomat and writer, part of the modernist movement. His works include "Ouvert la nuit" and "L’Homme pressé." 

Confirming the details: born 1888, died 1976, French writer. Perfect match. The user might be a student or trivia enthusiast, needing precise info. They probably want just the name, so I’ll present it clearly at the end.
