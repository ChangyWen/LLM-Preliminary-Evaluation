Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1908 and died in 1973, specifically noted as the "28th president of Chile." Hmm, the phrasing "28th president of Chile (1908–1973)" seems like it might be a slight mix-up—usually presidential terms are listed with dates of service, not lifespan. 

First, I need to recall Chilean presidential history. The 28th president was Salvador Allende, who served from 1970 to 1973. His lifespan matches perfectly: born June 26, 1908, and died September 11, 1973. The death date is especially memorable because it coincided with the US-backed coup that ended his presidency. 

The user's query has a small oddity—they wrote "28th president of Chile (1908–1973)" as if those were the term dates, but it's clearly the lifespan. Maybe they copied it from a poorly formatted source? Either way, the answer is unambiguous once cross-referenced. 

User seems to want a very structured response—they emphasized putting the final answer on a new line. Could be for quick copying, or maybe they're compiling data. I'll keep the explanation concise but clear, then isolate the name as requested. 

...And just double-checking: Allende was indeed the 28th (Jorge Alessandri was 27th, Allende 28th, Pinochet after the coup). No other Chilean president fits those birth/death dates. Solid match.
