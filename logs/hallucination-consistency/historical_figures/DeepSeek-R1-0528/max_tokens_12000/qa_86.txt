We are looking for a historical figure who:
 - Was born in 1879
 - Died in 1954
 - Is known as an Australian writer and feminist

 The most famous Australian writer and feminist born in 1879 and died in 1955 is Miles Franklin. However, note that the death year in the query is 1954. Let me double-check:

 Stella Maria Sarah Miles Franklin, known as Miles Franklin, was born on 14 October 1879 and died on 19 September 1954. This matches the given years.

 She is best known for her novel "My Brilliant Career" (1901) and is a celebrated feminist and writer in Australian literature.

 Therefore, the answer is Miles Franklin.
