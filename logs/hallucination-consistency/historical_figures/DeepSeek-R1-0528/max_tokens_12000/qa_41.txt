*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a Chilean politician and President who was born in 1896 and died in 1986.
 The key points are:
   - Born: 1896
   - Died: 1986
   - Nationality: Chilean
   - Position: President

 Let's recall some Chilean presidents who served in the 20th century. One of the most notable figures is Eduardo Frei Montalva.

 Eduardo Frei Montalva:
   - Born: January 16, 1911 → This does not match 1896.

 Another possibility is Arturo Alessandri Palma, but:
   - Born: December 20, 1868
   - Died: August 24, 1950 → Does not match.

 What about Gabriel González Videla?
   - Born: November 22, 1898 → Close but not 1896.

 Then we have Carlos Ibáñez del Campo:
   - Born: November 3, 1877
   - Died: April 28, 1960 → No.

 Let's try Jorge Alessandri Rodríguez:
   - Born: May 19, 1896
   - Died: August 31, 1986

 That matches the years: born in 1896 and died in 1986.

 Jorge Alessandri was the son of former President Arturo Alessandri Palma. He served as President of Chile from 1958 to 1964.

 Therefore, the answer is Jorge Alessandri.

Final answer:
Jorge Alessandri
