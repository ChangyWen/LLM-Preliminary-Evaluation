Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1840, died in 1902, and known as a "French writer." I need to recall famous French literary figures from that era. Let me think about the timeline: born 1840 means they were active in the late 19th century, and died in 1902 puts them in the Naturalism or early Modernism movements.

I remember Émile Zola fits perfectly: born April 2, 1840, died September 29, 1902. He's a giant of French literature, famous for his Rougon-Macquart novel series and his role in the Dreyfus Affair with "J'accuse." Other writers like Guy de Maupassant (1850-1893) or Alphonse Daudet (1840-1897) don't match the death year—Daudet died too early. Zola is the clear match.

The user might be a student or casual learner, possibly researching for homework or trivia. Their direct phrasing suggests they want a quick, accurate answer, so I'll keep it concise but informative. Ending with the name on a new line as requested ensures clarity.

I'll confirm Zola's details mentally: yes, his dates align, and his legacy as a novelist and social critic is well-established. This should fully resolve their query.
