*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Hmm, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1541, died in 1614, and described as a 'Greek painter, sculptor and architect.' I need to recall who fits this description perfectly. The dates are specific: born 1541, died 1614, so that's a lifespan of 73 years.

I'm thinking about famous Greek artists from that era. The term 'Greek' might refer to someone from Greece or of Greek descent, but during the Renaissance, many Greek artists worked in Italy. The most prominent name that comes to mind is El Greco, whose real name was Doménikos Theotokópoulos. He was born in Crete in 1541 and died in Toledo, Spain, in 1614. That matches the dates exactly.

Now, about his professions: El Greco is indeed known as a painter, sculptor, and architect. His paintings are his most famous works, like "The Burial of the Count of Orgaz," but he also dabbled in sculpture and architecture, designing altarpieces and other structures. So, the description fits him perfectly.

The user specifically asks for the answer on a new line at the end. I should make sure my response is clear and concise, building up to that final answer. Also, I can add a bit of context to make it educational and engaging, as the user seems interested in history or art.

Assessing the user's scenario: They might be a student, researcher, or someone curious about art history. Their actual need is straightforward—to get the correct name—but deeper down, they could be seeking more insights into this figure's life or why he's significant. I'll include a brief mention of his influence to satisfy that potential unspoken interest.

Finally, I'll structure my response: Start with confirming the dates, explain who he is, and end with the name as requested. That way, it's helpful and follows instructions precisely.

The historical figure who matches all these criteria—born in 1541, died in 1614, and renowned as a Greek painter, sculptor, and architect—is **El Greco**.

*   **Born:** 1541 in Candia (modern-day Heraklion), Crete (then part of the Republic of Venice).
*   **Died:** April 7, 1614, in Toledo, Spain.
*   **Professions:** He was a highly influential painter of the Spanish Renaissance, known for his dramatic and expressionistic style. While primarily celebrated as a painter, he also worked as a sculptor and architect, particularly designing complete altar compositions that included painted elements, sculpted figures, and the architectural framework itself.

Although he spent most of his career in Spain, his origins in Crete (culturally Greek at the time) and his early training there firmly establish his Greek heritage.
