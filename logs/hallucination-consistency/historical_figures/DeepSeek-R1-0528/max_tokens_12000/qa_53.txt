*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a French dramatist born in 1639 and died in 1699.
 Let's recall famous French dramatists from that period. 
 One of the most famous is Jean Racine, but let's check the dates:
  - Jean Racine: born 22 December 1639, died 21 April 1699.
 That matches the given years.

 Another prominent dramatist of the time is Molière, but:
  - Molière: born in 1622 and died in 1673. Doesn't match.

 Pierre Corneille: born 1606, died 1684. Doesn't match.

 Therefore, the historical figure we are looking for is Jean Racine.

 Final answer: Jean Racine
