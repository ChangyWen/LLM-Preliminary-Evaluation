*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are looking for a historical figure who:
  - Was born in 1798
  - Died in 1834
  - Is known as the first Emperor of Brazil

 The first Emperor of Brazil was Dom Pedro I, who declared Brazil's independence from Portugal in 1822 and became its first emperor.

 Let's check the dates:
  - Born: October 12, 1798
  - Died: September 24, 1834

 This matches the given years.

 Therefore, the answer is Dom Pedro I.

 However, note that the question says "first Emperor of Brazil (1798-1834)". This is a bit unusual because the reign of Dom Pedro I as Emperor of Brazil was from 1822 to 1831. He abdicated in 1831 and died in 1834.

 But the birth and death years are correct.

 Final answer: Dom Pedro I
