*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, the user is asking about a historical figure born in 1920, died in 2005, and known as the 264th pope of the Catholic Church. Let me start by recalling the list of popes. Pope John Paul II comes to mind immediately because his papacy was quite long and memorable. 

First, I need to verify his birth and death years. I remember he was born in 1920 in Poland and died in 2005. That matches the given dates. Now, checking the 264th pope part. The numbering of popes can be tricky with some antipopes, but generally, John Paul II is recognized as the 264th. 

The user might be a student working on a history project or someone interested in religious figures. They provided clear details, so they probably want a straightforward answer. But maybe they also need context about his significance, like his role in ending Communism or his global influence. 

I should confirm the exact dates to be thorough. Born May 18, 1920; died April 2, 2005. His papacy started in 1978. Yes, that fits. Also, his name before becoming pope was Karol Józef Wojtyła. Including that adds depth. 

The user might not know about his impact, so mentioning his sainthood could be helpful. They might appreciate why he's important beyond just the dates. Ensuring accuracy is key here, so double-checking sources in my knowledge base is important. 

Finally, the user wants the answer on a new line. So, after explaining, I'll put the name clearly at the end. Making sure there's no confusion with other popes like John Paul I, who had a very short papacy before him.
