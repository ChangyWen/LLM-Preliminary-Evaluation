Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1842 and died in 1898, known as a French Symbolist poet. Hmm, first, I need to recall who the prominent French Symbolist poets were. The Symbolist movement was in the late 19th century, right? So key figures might include people like Charles Baudelaire, but wait, Baudelaire was born in 1821 and died in 1867, so that's too early. Then there's Paul Verlaine, who was a major Symbolist poet. Let me check his dates. Paul Verlaine was born in 1844 and died in 1896. Close, but not exactly matching the years given. The user specified 1842 to 1898. Another name that comes to mind is Stéphane Mallarmé. He was born in 1842 and died in 1898. That fits the dates perfectly. Let me confirm. Mallarmé was indeed a leading figure in the Symbolist movement. His works include "L'Après-midi d'un Faune," which is a key Symbolist poem. So the answer should be Stéphane Mallarmé. I need to make sure there's no other poet with those exact birth and death years. Let me think again. Arthur Rimbaud was born in 1854 and died in 1891, so not him. Paul Valéry was born in 1871, too late. So yes, Mallarmé is the one. The dates match, and he's a central figure in French Symbolism.
