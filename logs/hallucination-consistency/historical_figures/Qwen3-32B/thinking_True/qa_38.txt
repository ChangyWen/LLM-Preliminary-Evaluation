Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1807 and died in 1882. They also mention that this person was an Italian general, patriot, and republican. Hmm, I need to think about Italian history from that time period.

First, the dates: 1807 to 1882. The 19th century, so maybe related to the unification of Italy, which happened around the 1860s. The key figures in the Risorgimento, the movement for Italian unification, include people like Giuseppe Garibaldi, Giuseppe Mazzini, and Count Cavour. Let me check the birth and death years of these individuals.

Giuseppe Garibaldi was born in 1807 and died in 1882. That matches the dates given. He was a general and a key figure in the unification of Italy. He's known for his military campaigns, like the Expedition of the Thousand, which helped take the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. He was a republican, which fits the description. 

Giuseppe Mazzini was born in 1805 and died in 1872, so the dates don't match. Cavour was born in 1810 and died in 1861, so that's not it either. Another possibility could be Victor Emmanuel II, but he was a king, not a general or a republican. 

So putting it all together, the answer is likely Giuseppe Garibaldi. Let me double-check his roles: general, patriot, republican. Yes, he was a general in the Italian unification, a patriot for his country, and a republican, as he supported a republic rather than a monarchy. The dates also align perfectly. I think that's the correct answer.
