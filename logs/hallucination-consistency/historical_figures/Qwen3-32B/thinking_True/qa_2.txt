Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1952, died in 2001, known as an English writer and humorist. Hmm. First, I need to think of notable English writers and humorists from that time period.

1952 to 2001... So the person lived 49 years. Let me think. The years 1952 to 2001... Who was born in 1952? Some famous people from that year include Princess Diana, but she was born in 1961. Wait, no. Wait, 1952... Maybe someone in the arts. Let me think. The user mentioned humorist, so maybe a comedian or a satirist.

Wait, Douglas Adams comes to mind. He was a British writer, known for "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." Let me check his dates. He was born in 1952 and died in 2001. Yes, that fits. He was definitely a humorist and a writer. So the answer is Douglas Adams. Let me confirm. Yes, Douglas Adams was born on March 11, 1952, and died on May 11, 2001. He's well-known for his science fiction comedy series. That must be the person they're referring to.
