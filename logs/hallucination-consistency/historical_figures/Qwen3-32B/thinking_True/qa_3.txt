Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1809 and died in 1865, who was the 16th president of the United States. Hmm, I need to make sure I get the details right.

First, the birth and death years: 1809 to 1865. The 16th president. Let me think. The presidents of the US... Lincoln was the 16th president, right? He was a key figure during the Civil War. He was born in 1809, which would make him 56 when he died in 1865. Wait, but wasn't he assassinated in 1865? Yes, John Wilkes Booth shot him at Ford's Theatre. So that fits the death year. 

Let me double-check the numbers. The 16th president: let's count. Washington was 1, then Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Adams, Jackson, Van Buren, Harrison, Tyler, Polk, Taylor, Fillmore, Pierce, then... 15th would be Buchanan, and 16th is Lincoln. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be Abraham Lincoln. 

I should also confirm the birth year. Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Kentucky. He's one of the most well-known presidents for leading the country through the Civil War and abolishing slavery with the Emancipation Proclamation. His death in 1865 was a significant event in American history. 

No other presidents fit that timeline. Let me think if there's any confusion with another president. Maybe someone else born in 1809? Let's see, other notable people born in 1809 include Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln. So that's a common trivia point. But the 16th president is definitely Lincoln. 

So the answer is Abraham Lincoln. I think that's solid. No mistakes here.
