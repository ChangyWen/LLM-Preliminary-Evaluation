Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1920, died in 2005, and known as the 264th pope of the Catholic Church. Hmm, first, I need to confirm the details. The 264th pope... Let me think. The popes are listed in order, so I need to check who was the 264th. I know that Pope John Paul II was a significant figure, but I'm not sure about his position in the list. Let me recall: Pope John Paul II was born in 1920, right? His birth name was Karol Józef Wojtyła. He was born on May 18, 1920, and he died on April 2, 2005. That matches the birth and death years given. Now, was he the 264th pope? Let me verify. I remember that Pope John Paul II was the head of the Catholic Church from 1978 until his death in 2005. To check his position, I can think of some other popes. For example, Pope Pius XII was before him, and then Paul VI, then John Paul I, and then John Paul II. If I count from the beginning, but I might not have the exact number. Alternatively, I can recall that the current pope, Francis, is the 266th, so John Paul II would be the 264th. Let me cross-check. If Pope John Paul II was the 264th, then the next one, John Paul I, was the 263rd, and then Paul VI was 262nd. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The numbering can be tricky. For example, Pope John Paul II was the second pope to take the name John Paul, so the first was John Paul I, who was the 263rd. Therefore, John Paul II would be the 264th. Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be Pope John Paul II. Let me confirm the dates again: born 1920, died 2005. Yes, that's correct. So the historical figure is Pope John Paul II.
