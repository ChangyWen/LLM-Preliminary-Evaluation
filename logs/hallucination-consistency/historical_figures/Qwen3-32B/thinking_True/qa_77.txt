Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 470 BCE and died in 399 BCE, known as an ancient Greek philosopher. Hmm, first, I need to recall the major philosophers from ancient Greece. The big names are Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Let me check their dates.

Socrates is a key figure. I remember he was a philosopher in Athens. His exact dates might be tricky because sometimes sources vary, but I think he was born around 470 BCE. He was executed in 399 BCE, right? That matches the years given here. Plato was his student, so he would have been born later, maybe around 428 BCE. Aristotle was even later, born in 384 BCE. So the dates here point to Socrates. 

Wait, but I should double-check. Some sources might say Socrates was born in 469 or 471, but the approximate year is 470. His death in 399 is pretty well-established because that's when he was sentenced to death by drinking hemlock. The charges were corrupting the youth and impiety. Yeah, that's Socrates. So the answer should be Socrates. Let me make sure there's no other philosopher with those dates. Maybe someone else? No, the other major ones are later. So I think it's definitely Socrates.
