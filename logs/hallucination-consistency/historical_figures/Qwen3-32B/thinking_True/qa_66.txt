Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1932 and died in 1986. The person is known as a Soviet and Russian filmmaker, writer, film editor, film theorist, and theatre and opera director. Hmm.

First, I need to think of notable Soviet or Russian filmmakers from that time period. The years 1932 to 1986 would mean the person was active during the mid-20th century. Let me recall some famous directors from the Soviet era. Andrei Tarkovsky comes to mind. He was a prominent Soviet filmmaker. Let me check his dates. Tarkovsky was born in 1932 and died in 1986. That matches the birth and death years given. 

He's known for films like "Andrei Rublev" and "Stalker," which are considered classics. He was also involved in film theory, which aligns with the description. Additionally, he worked in theatre and opera, which fits the other parts of the question. 

Another possibility might be someone like Sergei Eisenstein, but he was born in 1898 and died in 1948, so that doesn't fit. Kira Muratova? She was born in 1934 and died in 2011, so not matching. Maybe Alexander Sokurov? He was born in 1951, so too late. 

So, Andrei Tarkovsky seems to be the correct answer here. Let me double-check the dates again. Yes, he was born on April 29, 1932, and died on December 29, 1986. His roles as a filmmaker, writer, editor, theorist, and director in theatre and opera all match the description. I think that's the one.
