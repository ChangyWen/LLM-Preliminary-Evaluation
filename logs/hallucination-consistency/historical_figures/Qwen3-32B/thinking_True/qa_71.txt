Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 384 BCE and died in 322 BCE, known as an ancient Greek philosopher. Hmm, first, I need to recall the major ancient Greek philosophers. The big names are Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.

Socrates was born around 470 BCE and died in 399 BCE, so that's not matching the dates given. Plato was a student of Socrates. He was born around 428/427 BCE and died in 348/347 BCE. Wait, the death year here is 347 or 348, which is still earlier than 322. The dates given in the question are 384 BCE to 322 BCE. That leaves Aristotle. Let me check Aristotle's dates. He was born in 384 BCE and died in 322 BCE. Yes, that matches exactly. So the answer should be Aristotle. Let me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up any other philosophers. No, the other major ones like Pythagoras or Democritus don't fit those dates. Definitely Aristotle.
