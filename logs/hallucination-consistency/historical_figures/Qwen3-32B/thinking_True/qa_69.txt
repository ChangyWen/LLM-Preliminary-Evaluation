Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 427 BCE and died in 347 BCE, known as an ancient Greek philosopher. Hmm, first, I need to recall the major ancient Greek philosophers. The big names are Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.

Socrates was a philosopher, but I think he was born around 470 BCE and died in 399 BCE. Plato was his student. Plato's dates... I remember he was born around 428-427 BCE and died in 348-347 BCE. That matches the years given here. Then Aristotle was his student, born later, around 384 BCE. So the dates here, -427 to -347, that's 427 BCE to 347 BCE. So Plato's lifespan fits that. Let me double-check. Plato was born in 427 BCE, died in 347 BCE. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be Plato. I don't think there are other major philosophers with those exact dates. Maybe check if there's any confusion with other names, but I think Plato is the right one here.
