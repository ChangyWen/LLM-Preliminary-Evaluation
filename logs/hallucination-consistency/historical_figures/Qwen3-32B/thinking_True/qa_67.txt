Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1879 and died in 1953. The description mentions they were a Soviet politician, general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and premier of the Soviet Union. 

First, I need to recall who was the leader of the Soviet Union during that time. The key roles here are General Secretary of the Communist Party and Premier. The most prominent figure associated with those positions is Joseph Stalin. Let me check the dates. Stalin was born in 1878, not 1879. Wait, the user says 1879. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Maybe it's a typo? Because Stalin was born on December 18, 1878. So the birth year here is listed as 1879, but the death year is correct at 1953. 

Alternatively, could there be another Soviet leader with similar roles? Let me think. Leon Trotsky was a key figure, but he was expelled from the Communist Party in 1927 and assassinated in 1940, so that doesn't fit. Vladimir Lenin was the first leader, but he died in 1924. So after Lenin, Stalin became the General Secretary. 

Given that the user might have a typo in the birth year (1878 vs. 1879), but the death year is correct, the answer is still Joseph Stalin. The other details match: General Secretary of the Communist Party and Premier (he held the position of Premier from 1941 to 1953). So despite the birth year being off by a year, the rest of the information points to Stalin. I should note that in the answer, perhaps the user made a mistake in the birth year, but the correct answer is Joseph Stalin.

Joseph Stalin  
The historical figure described is Joseph Stalin. While the birth year mentioned (1879) is slightly off (he was born in 1878), the death year (1953) and his roles as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Premier of the Soviet Union align with Stalin's biography.
