Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1712 and died in 1779, known as a French veterinary surgeon. Hmm, I need to recall or find out who that might be.

First, I'll check the dates. 1712 to 1779. Let me think about notable French people from that era. The 18th century, so maybe someone from the Enlightenment period? But the user specified a veterinary surgeon. That's a specific field. 

I remember that France has a strong tradition in veterinary medicine. There was a time when the French military and agriculture needed good veterinary practices. Maybe someone who established a veterinary school? 

Wait, I think the name is Claude Bourgelat. Let me verify. Bourgelat was a French veterinarian, right? He founded the École de Médecine Vétérinaire in Lyon in 1761 or 1762. If he was born in 1712 and died in 1779, that fits the dates. Let me check his birth and death years. Yes, he was born on April 15, 1712, and died on April 20, 1779. That matches exactly. 

So, the answer should be Claude Bourgelat. He's known for establishing the first veterinary school in Europe, which was a significant contribution to the field. I don't think there's another prominent French veterinary surgeon from that time with those exact dates. Let me just make sure there's no confusion with another person. No, I think that's correct. The user is looking for the name, so the answer is Claude Bourgelat.
