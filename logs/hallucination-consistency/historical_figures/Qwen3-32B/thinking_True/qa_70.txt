Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1940, died in 1996, known as a Russian-American poet. Hmm. First, I need to think of poets who fit that time frame and have a Russian-American background.

So, born in 1940. Let me think. Czesław Miłosz comes to mind, but he was Polish, not Russian. Then there's Joseph Brodsky. Wait, Brodsky was born in 1940, right? And he was a Russian poet who later became an American citizen. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature. He died in 1996. That seems to fit. Let me double-check the dates. Yes, Joseph Brodsky was born on May 24, 1940, and died on January 28, 1996. He was indeed a Russian-American poet, known for his work in both Russian and English. He emigrated to the US in the 1970s. That must be the person they're referring to. I don't think there are many other prominent Russian-American poets from that era with those exact birth and death years. So the answer should be Joseph Brodsky.
