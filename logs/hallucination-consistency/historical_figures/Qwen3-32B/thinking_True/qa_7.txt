Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1888 and died in 1976, known as a French writer. Hmm, first, I need to think of French writers from that time period. Let me start by calculating the age. If they were born in 1888 and died in 1976, that's 88 years old. So they were active in the early to mid-20th century.

Now, famous French writers from that era... Well, there's Albert Camus, but he was born in 1913 and died in 1960. That's too late. Marcel Proust was born in 1871 and died in 1922, so that's earlier. Maybe someone else. Let me think. Simone de Beauvoir was born in 1908, so that's after 1888. How about André Gide? He was born in 1869 and died in 1951. Still not matching the dates. 

Wait, there's also Jean Cocteau, born in 1889, so that's close to 1888. He died in 1963. Not quite 1976. Maybe someone else. Let me check the years again. The person was born in 1888 and died in 1976. Let me think of other French writers. Oh, wait! There's Louis-Ferdinand Céline. He was born in 1894 and died in 1961. No, that's not it. 

Wait, maybe it's someone not as well-known? Let me try to recall. Another approach: 1888 to 1976. Let's see, the person would have been active during both World Wars. Maybe a Nobel laureate? Let me check. The Nobel Prize in Literature winners from that period. For example, Romain Rolland won in 1915, born in 1866, died 1944. Not matching. François Mauriac won in 1952, born 1885, died 1970. Close to the death year but not exactly 1976. 

Wait, maybe it's someone who wasn't a Nobel winner. Let me think again. The user mentioned "French writer," so maybe a novelist or poet. Let me think of authors born in 1888. Let me check... 1888. Let me think of the months. For example, André Malraux was born in 1901. No. Wait, there's also Paul Claudel, born in 1868. No. 

Wait, maybe it's a female writer? Colette was born in 1873, died in 1954. Still not. Let me think of the years again. 1888 to 1976. Let me try to calculate the age at death: 1976 minus 1888 is 88 years old. So the person lived to 88. Let me think of French writers who lived that long. 

Wait, there's also Jean-Paul Sartre, but he was born in 1905 and died in 1980. Close to the death year but not 1976. Wait, maybe someone else. Let me think of the 20th century. Oh! Wait, there's also Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, but he was born in 1900 and died in 1944. No. 

Wait, maybe it's a less famous writer. Let me try to think of the years again. 1888. Let me check if there's a notable French writer born that year. Let me think of the 1880s. 1888. Let me think of authors. Oh! Wait, there's also Louis Aragon, born in 1897. No. 

Wait, maybe the user is thinking of someone like Colette, but she was born in 1873. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's someone from the Dreyfus Affair era? Let me think. Maybe someone involved in that. 

Wait, another approach: Let me check the death year. 1976. So the person died in 1976. Let me think of French writers who died in 1976. Let me recall. Simone de Beauvoir died in 1986. No. Jean Cocteau died in 1963. Wait, maybe someone else. Let me think. Oh! Wait, there's also André Gide, but he died in 1951. 

Wait, maybe the user is mistaken in the dates? Or perhaps it's a different nationality? No, the user specified French. Let me think again. 1888-1976. Let me check if there's a French writer with those exact dates. Let me think of the 1888 birth year. Let me think of authors born in 1888. For example, in the US, there's F. Scott Fitzgerald, but he was American. In France, maybe... Let me check. 

Wait, I think I'm missing someone. Let me think of the 20th century. Oh! Wait, there's also Jean Giraudoux, a French playwright and writer. He was born in 1882 and died in 1947. No. 

Wait, maybe it's someone like Paul Morand, born in 1888. Yes! Paul Morand was a French writer, born on September 16, 1888, and died on October 17, 1976. That fits the dates. He was a novelist, essayist, and diplomat. He was also a member of the Académie française. So the answer is Paul Morand. Let me confirm the dates. Yes, Paul Morand was born in 1888 and died in 1976. He's known as a French writer. That must be the correct answer.
