Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1949, died in 2002, who was an American pornographic actress and later became an anti-porn activist. Hmm.

First, I need to recall names from the 1970s or 80s in the porn industry. The 1949 birth year would make her around 20 in 1969, but maybe she started later. Wait, 1949 to 2002 is a 53-year span. So she was active in the 70s or 80s as a porn actress.

I remember some names like Linda Lovelace, but she was born in 1949. Let me check. Linda Lovelace was born in 1949, right? She was in the movie "Deep Throat," which was a big hit. Then later she became an anti-porn activist. She died in 2002. That fits the timeline. 

Wait, was she American? Yes, she was from the US. So the answer is Linda Lovelace. Let me confirm the dates again. Born 1949, died 2002. Yes, that's correct. She was a prominent figure in the porn industry and later spoke out against it. I think that's the person they're referring to.
