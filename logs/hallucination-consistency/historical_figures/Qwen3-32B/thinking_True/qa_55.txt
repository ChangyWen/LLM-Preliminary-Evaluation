Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1844, died in 1896, known as a French poet. Hmm. First, I need to recall French poets from that time period. Let me think. The 19th century had a lot of notable poets. Let me check the years.

1844 to 1896. So the person lived for 52 years. Let me think of famous French poets. Baudelaire was born in 1821, so that's too early. Rimbaud was born in 1854, so that's later. Verlaine was born in 1844. Wait, that matches the birth year. Let me confirm his death year. Verlaine died in 1896. Yes, that fits. So the answer is Paul Verlaine. He was a French poet associated with the Symbolist movement. Let me double-check to make sure there's no other poet with those exact years. Maybe someone else? Let me think. Mallarm√© was born in 1842, died in 1898. No. So Verlaine is the one. Yeah, I think that's correct.
