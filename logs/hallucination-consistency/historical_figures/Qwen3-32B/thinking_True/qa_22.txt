Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1945, died in 1981, known as a Jamaican singer, songwriter, and musician. Hmm. First, I need to think of Jamaican musicians from that time period. The years 1945 to 1981... That's a 36-year span. Let me break it down.

The person was born in 1945, so they would have been 36 when they died in 1981. That's a relatively young age. Now, thinking of famous Jamaican musicians. Bob Marley comes to mind. He was a singer, songwriter, and musician. Let me check his dates. Bob Marley was born on February 6, 1945, and he died on May 11, 1981. That fits the birth and death years exactly. 

Wait, but I should make sure there aren't others. Maybe someone else from reggae or another genre. But Bob Marley is the most iconic Jamaican musician from that era. He was part of Bob Marley and the Wailers, wrote songs like "No Woman, No Cry," "One Love," etc. His death was due to cancer, I think. Yes, he had acral lentiginous melanoma, which he didn't treat properly, leading to his death. 

Are there any other Jamaican artists from that time? Maybe Peter Tosh or Bunny Wailer, but they were part of the same group. Peter Tosh was born in 1944 and died in 1987, so not matching the dates. Bunny Wailer was born in 1940 and died in 2021. So no, Bob Marley is the one that fits. Let me just confirm the dates again. 1945 birth, 1981 death. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be Bob Marley.
