Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1431 and died in 1463, known as a French poet and criminal. Hmm. First, I need to recall who fits those dates. Let me think about French history around that time. The 15th century... The Hundred Years' War was still going on, right? Maybe someone involved in that period.

The name that comes to mind is François Villon. I remember he was a French poet, part of the French Renaissance, but he lived in the late 15th century. Wait, his dates... Let me check. François Villon was born around 1431 and died in 1463. Yes, that matches. He was known for his poetry, like "Le Lais" and "Le Testament," and he had a criminal past. He was involved in theft and even killed someone, which led to his death sentence. So he fits the description of a poet and criminal. I think that's the person they're referring to. Let me make sure there aren't any other notable figures with similar dates. I don't recall another prominent French poet from that exact time period with a criminal background. Yeah, François Villon is the one.
