Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1564 and died in 1616, known as an English playwright and poet. Hmm, 1564 to 1616... I remember that's a famous year range. Shakespeare comes to mind immediately. William Shakespeare, right? He was a playwright and poet, wrote a lot of plays like Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, etc. Let me double-check the dates. Yes, he was born on April 23, 1564, and died on April 23, 1616. That matches the years given. I don't think there's another prominent English playwright from that time with those exact birth and death years. Maybe someone else? Like Marlowe? But Marlowe was born in 1564 as well, but he died in 1593. So no, that's not it. Definitely Shakespeare. The user probably wants the full name, so William Shakespeare. Let me confirm once more. Yes, he's the most famous English playwright and poet of that era with those dates. No other major figures come to mind with those exact years. So the answer should be William Shakespeare.
