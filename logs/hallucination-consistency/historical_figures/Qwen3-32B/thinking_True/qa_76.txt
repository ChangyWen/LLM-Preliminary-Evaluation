Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1899 and died in 1986. They mention that this person was an Argentine short story writer, essayist, poet, and translator. Hmm, I need to think of notable Argentine writers from that time period.

First, I'll consider the birth and death years. 1899 to 1986 means the person lived through most of the 20th century. Let me think of famous Argentine authors. Jorge Luis Borges comes to mind. He was a writer, poet, and essayist. Let me check his dates. Borges was born in 1899 and died in 1986. That matches the years given. 

Wait, are there any other Argentine writers from that era with similar credentials? Maybe someone like Julio Cortázar? But Cortázar was born in 1914 and died in 1984, so the years don't match. Another possibility could be Adolfo Bioy Casares, but he was born in 1914 as well. So Borges is the one who fits the 1899-1986 timeframe. 

Borges is well-known for his short stories, essays, poetry, and translations. He wrote in Spanish and is considered one of the most important figures in world literature. His works include "Ficciones" and "The Aleph." He also collaborated with Bioy Casares on some works. 

I think that's the correct answer. Let me just confirm the dates again. Yes, Jorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Borges Acevedo was born on August 24, 1899, and died on June 14, 1986. All the details match the user's query. There's no other prominent Argentine writer from that exact period with those roles. So the answer should be Jorge Luis Borges.
