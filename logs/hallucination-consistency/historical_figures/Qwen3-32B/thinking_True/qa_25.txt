Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1713 and died in 1784, known as a French Enlightenment philosopher and encyclopedist. Hmm, first, I need to recall key figures from the Enlightenment period in France. The main names that come to mind are Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot.

Voltaire was a prominent Enlightenment writer, but I think he was born in 1694 and died in 1778. So that doesn't fit the dates given. Rousseau was born in 1712 and died in 1778. Close on the birth year but not exact. Then there's Denis Diderot. Let me check his dates. Diderot was born in 1713 and died in 1784. That matches the years provided. Also, he's well-known for his work on the Encyclopédie, which was a major project of the Enlightenment. So the answer is likely Denis Diderot. I should confirm if there are any other possible candidates, but given the dates and the role as an encyclopedist, Diderot is the most fitting. The user might be referring to him. Let me just double-check the dates again to be sure. Yes, 1713-1784 for Diderot. Yep, that's correct.
