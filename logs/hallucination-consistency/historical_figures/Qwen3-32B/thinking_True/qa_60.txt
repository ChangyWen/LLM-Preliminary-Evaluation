Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1888 and died in 1946, a Chilean politician and president. First, I need to check the dates. If they were born in 1888 and died in 1946, their age at death would be 58 years old. Now, the key points here are Chilean president, born 1888, died 1946.

I should think about Chilean presidents around that time. Let me recall. The 20th century Chilean presidents... There's Pedro Aguirre Cerda, who was president in the 1930s. He was a socialist. Wait, when did he die? I think he was assassinated in 1938. That doesn't fit the death year of 1946. Another name that comes to mind is Salvador Allende, but he was born in 1908 and died in 1973, so that's not it. 

Wait, maybe it's someone else. Let me check the timeline. If the person was president from, say, the 1930s or 1940s. The user mentioned the president's term as (1888-1946), but that can't be right because they were born in 1888. So that must be a typo or misunderstanding. The user probably meant the person was president during some time between those years, not that their presidency spanned from 1888 to 1946. 

So, looking for a Chilean president who was born in 1888 and died in 1946. Let me think. There's Arturo Alessandri Palma. He was president multiple times. He was born in 1868 and died in 1950, so that's not matching. Another possibility is Juan Esteban Montero, but he was president in the 19th century. 

Wait, maybe it's Ibañez? Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. He was president in the 1920s and 1950s. Let me check his dates. He was born in 1877 and died in 1952. Still not matching. 

Wait, the user might have made a mistake in the dates. Let me try to find a Chilean president born in 1888. Let me think. There's Pedro Aguirre Cerda again. He was born in 1876 and died in 1938. No. Maybe someone else. 

Wait, maybe the user confused the birth and death years. If the person was president in the 1930s or 1940s, born in 1888, died in 1946. Let me check. Let me think of Chilean presidents in the 1940s. There's Juan Antonio Ríos, who was president from 1942 to 1946. He was born in 1888 and died in 1946. That fits! So Juan Antonio Ríos was born on April 20, 1888, and died on September 27, 1946. He was a Chilean president, serving from 1942 until his death in 1946. That matches the criteria given. 

I need to confirm this. Let me verify the dates. Yes, Juan Antonio Ríos was indeed born in 1888 and died in 1946, serving as president of Chile. So the answer should be Juan Antonio Ríos.
