Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the historical figure born in 1452 and died in 1519, known as an Italian Renaissance polymath. Let me start by recalling the key dates. 1452 to 1519... I remember that the Renaissance period in Italy was a time of great cultural and intellectual growth, and there were several famous figures from that era.

First, I think of the most well-known polymaths. Leonardo da Vinci comes to mind. He was an artist, inventor, scientist, and more. Let me check his dates. I believe he was born in 1452 and died in 1519. That matches the years given here. But wait, I should make sure there aren't others. For example, Michelangelo was another Renaissance figure, but I think he was born later, maybe around 1475. Galileo was much later, in the 16th century. So that's not him. 

Another possibility is someone like Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, but he was a political philosopher and writer, not a polymath in the same sense as da Vinci. Then there's Erasmus, but he was from the Netherlands, not Italy. So focusing on Italy, the key polymath with those exact dates is likely Leonardo da Vinci. Let me confirm the dates again. Yes, Leonardo da Vinci was born on April 15, 1452, in Vinci, Italy, and he died on May 2, 1519. His works include the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, and he's known for his contributions to art, science, engineering, anatomy, and more. That fits the description of an Italian Renaissance polymath. I don't think there's another figure with those exact birth and death years who is as renowned. So the answer should be Leonardo da Vinci.
