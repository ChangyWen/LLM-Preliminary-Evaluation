Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1927, died in 2010, and known as a Dutch writer. First, I need to recall Dutch writers from that time period. Let me think... 1927 to 2010. So they lived 83 years. Let me list some famous Dutch authors.

There's Anne Frank, but she was born in 1929 and died in 1945, so that's not it. Then there's Vincent van Gogh, but he was a painter, not a writer, and he died in 1906. Maybe someone else. Let me think of more contemporary writers. Cees Nooteboom? He was born in 1933, so that's too late. Willem Frederik Hermans? He was born in 1921 and died in 1995. Not quite. What about Harry Mulisch? He was born in 1927. Wait, that's the birth year the user mentioned. Let me check his death date. Harry Mulisch died in 2010. Yes! He was a Dutch writer, known for works like "The Assault" (De Aanslag). That fits the criteria. Let me confirm the dates again: born 1927, died 2010. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be Harry Mulisch.
