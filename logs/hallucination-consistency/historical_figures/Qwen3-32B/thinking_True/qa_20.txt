Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1904 and died in 1996, known as a Czech association football player. First, I need to recall notable Czech footballers from that era. The years 1904 to 1996 span almost a century, so the person would have been active in the early to mid-20th century.

Czechoslovakia was a country back then, so maybe the player was from there. I'm thinking of famous players from that time. One name that comes to mind is Antonín Puč. He was a Czech footballer who played in the 1920s and 1930s. Let me check his birth and death years. If I remember correctly, he was born in 1904 and died in 1996. That matches the given dates. 

Wait, but I should verify. Another possibility is that the user might be referring to someone else, but Puč is one of the most prominent Czech players from that period. He was a forward and played for the Czechoslovak national team. His career would have been during the 1920s and 1930s, which fits the timeline. Also, living until 1996 would make him 92 years old, which is plausible. 

I don't think there are other major Czech footballers from that exact birth year who lived that long. Let me cross-check. Maybe someone like Karel Čermák? No, he was born in 1898. Another name: Josef Bican. He was born in 1913, so that's later. So Puč seems to fit. 

Therefore, the answer is likely Antonín Puč. I should confirm the dates again. Yes, Antonín Puč was born on April 10, 1904, and died on April 10, 1996. That's a full 92 years, which matches. So the answer is correct.
