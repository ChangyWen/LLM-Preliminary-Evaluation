Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1872 and died in 1928, known as a Norwegian explorer who was the first to reach the South Pole.

First, I need to recall who the first person to reach the South Pole was. I remember that there was a race between two explorers: Roald Amundsen and Robert Falcon Scott. Amundsen was Norwegian, and Scott was British. Since the question specifies a Norwegian explorer, it's likely Amundsen. 

Now checking the dates. Roald Amundsen was born on July 16, 1872, and he died on June 18, 1928. That matches the birth and death years given in the question. 

To confirm, Amundsen led the expedition that reached the South Pole on December 14, 1911, beating Scott's team. So all the details fit: Norwegian, born 1872, died 1928, first to South Pole. 

I don't think there's another explorer that fits these criteria. Maybe double-check if there's any other Norwegian explorer from that time, but I can't think of any. The key points all align with Roald Amundsen.
