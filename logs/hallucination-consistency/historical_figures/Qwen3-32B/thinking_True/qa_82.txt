Okay, so I need to figure out the name of the historical figure born in 1642 and died in 1727, who was a British physicist and mathematician. Let me start by recalling some famous scientists from that time period. The years 1642 to 1727... Hmm, I think that's a well-known time frame for a major scientist. Let me think... Isaac Newton comes to mind. I remember he was a key figure in the scientific revolution. He formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation. But wait, was he British? Yes, he was born in England. Let me check the dates again. If he was born in 1642 and died in 1727, that's 85 years. I think Newton lived to be around 84 or 85, so that fits. Another possibility could be someone else, but I can't think of another major British physicist and mathematician from that era. Maybe Robert Hooke? But Hooke was born in 1635 and died in 1703, so the dates don't match. Galileo was earlier, in the 1500s. So it's definitely Newton. Let me confirm the dates again. Yes, Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643 (which was January 25, 1643 in the Julian calendar, but the Gregorian calendar is now used, so sometimes it's listed as 1642). He died on March 31, 1727. So the answer should be Isaac Newton.
