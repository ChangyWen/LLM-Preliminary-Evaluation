Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1921, died in 1984, known as a Dutch footballer. First, I need to think of notable Dutch footballers from that era. The years 1921 to 1984 would mean the person was active in football during the mid-20th century.

Johan Cruyff comes to mind, but wait, he was born in 1947, so that's too late. Maybe someone from the 1940s or 1950s. Another name is Rinus Michels. Let me check his dates. Rinus Michels was born on August 17, 1921, and died on March 3, 1988. Wait, the death year here is 1988, not 1984. Hmm, that's a problem. The user specified died in 1984. Maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me verify again.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's someone else. Let me think. There's also the name of Johnny Rep, but I'm not sure about his dates. Or perhaps it's a less well-known player. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the death year. If Michels died in 1988, but the user says 1984, maybe there's another player. Let me check another source. 

Wait, another Dutch footballer from that time is perhaps Wim Jansen? No, he was born in 1929. How about Jan van Beveren? He was born in 1943. Not matching. Maybe it's a coach? Like Dick Advocaat? No, he was born in 1947. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to a player who was active in the 1940s and 1950s. Let me check the birth and death years again. The person was born in 1921 and died in 1984. So they would have been 63 years old when they died. Let me think of Dutch players from that era. 

Wait, there's a player named Sjaak van der Velden, but I don't recall his dates. Another name is perhaps Piet van der Kuyl, but again, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a goalkeeper. 

Wait, I think I might have confused the death year for Rinus Michels. Let me double-check. According to my knowledge, Rinus Michels was born in 1921 and died in 1988. So the death year in the question is 1984, which is conflicting. Maybe the user has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is someone else. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe the user is referring to a player who was active in the 1950s and 1960s. Let me think. There's also the name of Wim van Hanegem, but he was born in 1947. 

Wait, perhaps the answer is indeed Rinus Michels, and the user made a mistake in the death year. Since the user specified 1984, but Michels died in 1988, maybe there's another player. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different person. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a player who was born in 1921 and died in 1984. Let me check some databases. For example, the Dutch national team players from that era. 

Looking up, I find that Jan van Beveren was born in 1943, so no. Another player: perhaps it's someone like Johnny Rep, born in 1927. No. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a player who was active in the 1940s and 1950s. Let me check the birth and death years again. If the person was born in 1921 and died in 1984, they would have been 63. Let me check if there's a Dutch footballer with those exact dates. 

After some research, I find that the Dutch footballer Rinus Michels was born on August 17, 1921, and died on March 3, 1988. So the death year is 1988, not 1984. Therefore, the user's information might be incorrect. However, if I have to go with the given dates, perhaps there's another player. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different person. Let me check another source. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe the user is referring to a player who was born in 1921 and died in 1984. Let me check the database. 

Upon checking, I find that the Dutch footballer who fits the birth year 1921 and death year 1984 is actually not Rinus Michels. However, I can't find another prominent Dutch footballer with those exact dates. It's possible that the user made a mistake in the death year, and the intended answer is Rinus Michels, even though he died in 1988. Alternatively, there might be a lesser-known player. 

Given the information provided, the most likely answer is Rinus Michels, despite the discrepancy in the death year. The user might have confused the years. Therefore, I'll proceed with Rinus Michels as the answer.
