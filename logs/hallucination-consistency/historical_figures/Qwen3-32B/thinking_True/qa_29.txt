Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1854 and died in 1891. They mention that this person was a 19th-century French poet who influenced modern literature and arts and prefigured surrealism.

First, I need to think of French poets from that time period. The years 1854 to 1891 would place the person's life between the mid-19th century and the late 1800s. Some notable French poets from that era include Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Verlaine, Mallarmé, and maybe others like Apollinaire, but Apollinaire was born in 1880, so he's a bit later. 

The key points here are that the poet influenced modern literature and arts and prefigured surrealism. Surrealism emerged in the early 20th century, so the person in question must have been active before that. The term "prefigured" suggests that their work had elements that later surrealists would adopt. 

Baudelaire was a major figure, but he died in 1867, so that's too early. Rimbaud was born in 1854 and died in 1891. Wait, that matches the birth and death years given. Arthur Rimbaud was a French poet known for his work during the late 19th century. His poetry is considered highly innovative and influenced many modernist movements. He was part of the Symbolist movement, which did have an impact on later movements like surrealism. 

Verlaine was another contemporary, but he was born in 1844 and died in 1896. Mallarmé was born in 1842 and died in 1898. So Rimbaud fits the birth and death years. His work, such as "A Season in Hell" and "Illuminations," is known for its experimental style and themes that would later be echoed in surrealism. 

Another possibility could be Paul Cézanne, but he was a painter, not a poet. The question specifies a poet. So putting it all together, Arthur Rimbaud seems to fit the description. Let me double-check the dates: Rimbaud was born on October 20, 1854, and died on November 10, 1891. Yes, that matches. His influence on modern literature and prefiguring surrealism is well-documented. So the answer should be Arthur Rimbaud.
