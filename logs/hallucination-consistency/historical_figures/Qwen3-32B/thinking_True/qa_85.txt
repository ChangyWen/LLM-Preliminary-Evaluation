Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1908 and died in 1991, known as an American physicist and engineer. Hmm. First, I need to think of notable people from that time period. Let me start by recalling some famous physicists from the 20th century.

Albert Einstein comes to mind, but he was born in 1879 and died in 1955, so that's not matching the dates. Then there's Richard Feynman, but he was born in 1918 and died in 1988. Not quite. How about someone involved in the Manhattan Project? J. Robert Oppenheimer was born in 1904 and died in 1967. Still not the right dates. 

Wait, maybe someone from the mid-20th century. Let me think. The person was active in both physics and engineering. Maybe someone related to space exploration? Wernher von Braun was a German engineer who worked on NASA's Apollo program, but he was born in 1912 and died in 1977. Not matching the years. 

What about someone in the field of electrical engineering or computer science? John von Neumann was a mathematician and physicist, born in 1903, died in 1957. No. Maybe someone from the later part of the 20th century. Let me check the years again: born 1908, died 1991. That gives them a lifespan of 83 years. 

Wait, there's a famous physicist who worked on radar and later on space exploration. Robert Goddard? No, he was born in 1882 and died in 1945. Not matching. How about someone from the Bell Labs? Maybe someone involved in transistors? John Bardeen was born in 1908. Wait, that's the birth year. Let me check his death date. John Bardeen was an American physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics twice. He was born on May 23, 1908, and died on January 30, 1991. That fits the dates. 

He was known for his work on the transistor and superconductivity. So, John Bardeen would be the answer. Let me confirm: born 1908, died 1991, American physicist and engineer. Yes, that's correct. He was a key figure in the development of the transistor at Bell Labs, which was a major advancement in electronics. He also contributed to the theory of superconductivity. So I think that's the person the user is referring to.
