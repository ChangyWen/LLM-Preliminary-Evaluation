Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1911, died in 1982, and was the President of Chile. First, I need to check if there's a president of Chile who fits those dates.

Wait, the user wrote "President of Chile (1911-1982)" in the question. That might be a typo because 1911-1982 would be the years of presidency, but the person was born in 1911 and died in 1982. So maybe the dates in the parentheses are their lifespan, not their presidency. Let me confirm.

If the person was born in 1911 and died in 1982, they lived 71 years. Now, who was the president of Chile during that time? Let me think. Salvador Allende comes to mind. He was a socialist president, right? He was in office from 1970 until 1973 when the coup happened. Let me check his birth and death dates. Allende was born on December 23, 1908, and died on September 11, 1973. Wait, that doesn't match the 1911-1982 dates. So maybe not Allende.

Another possibility: Augusto Pinochet? He was a military dictator who took power in 1973. He was born in 1915 and died in 2006. No, that's not matching the 1911-1982 dates either.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Let me think again. The person was born in 1911 and died in 1982. Let me check Chilean presidents around that time. Let's see, the presidents in the mid-20th century. For example, Jorge Alessandri was president in the 1950s and 1960s. He was born in 1898 and died in 1986. Not matching. Eduardo Frei Montalva, president from 1964 to 1970. He was born in 1911 and died in 1982. Oh! That fits. Eduardo Frei Montalva was born on April 23, 1911, and died on April 2, 1982. He was the President of Chile from 1964 to 1970. So the user might have confused the presidency dates with the lifespan. The user wrote "President of Chile (1911-1982)" but that's actually the person's birth and death years. The presidency was from 1964-1970. So the correct answer is Eduardo Frei Montalva.
