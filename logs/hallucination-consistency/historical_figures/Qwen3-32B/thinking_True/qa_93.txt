Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1707 and died in 1778. They also mention that this person was a Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist. Hmm, I need to think of someone from that time period and those fields.

First, I remember that Carl Linnaeus is a big name in botany. He was Swedish, right? Let me check the dates. Linnaeus was born in 1707 and died in 1778. That matches the years given. He's known for developing the system of binomial nomenclature, which is the way we name species today. So he's definitely a botanist and zoologist. Also, he had some medical training, so physician makes sense too. 

Wait, is there anyone else from that time? Maybe someone else from Sweden? I can't think of another prominent figure in those fields with those exact dates. Let me confirm the dates again. Yes, Linnaeus was born on May 23, 1707, and died on January 10, 1778. That fits perfectly. His contributions to taxonomy are legendary. So the answer should be Carl Linnaeus. I don't think there's any confusion here. The key points are the dates, the nationality, and the fields mentioned. All point to Linnaeus.
