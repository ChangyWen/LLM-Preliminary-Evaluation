Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1700 and died in 1755. The description mentions a German-born French soldier and statesman. Hmm, I need to think of someone who fits that profile.

First, the time period: 1700 to 1755. That's the early to mid-18th century. The person was born in Germany but became a French soldier and statesman. So maybe someone who moved to France and had a significant role there.

I'm trying to recall French military leaders or politicians from that era. The name that comes to mind is Maurice de Saxe. Wait, Maurice de Saxe was a German-born French general, right? He was born in 1696, though. Wait, the user says 1700. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me check. Maurice de Saxe was born in 1696 and died in 1750. So that's not matching the 1700-1755 timeframe. 

Another possibility: maybe someone else. Let me think. There's also the Marquis de Vaudreuil, but he was a Canadian governor. Not sure. Or maybe someone from the Seven Years' War period. The Seven Years' War was 1756-1763, so just after 1755. The person in question died in 1755, so maybe they were involved in that conflict.

Wait, there's also the Duke of Richelieu, but he was born in 1696 as well. Hmm. Maybe the user's dates are slightly off, or perhaps I'm missing someone. Let me think again. The key points are German-born, French soldier and statesman, 1700-1755. 

Oh, wait! There's also the case of the Duke of Gramont, but I don't think he was German-born. Another angle: maybe a general who served under Louis XV. Maurice de Saxe was a prominent figure, but his dates don't fit. Maybe the user is referring to someone else. 

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the birth year. If the person was born in 1700 and died in 1755, that's a 55-year lifespan. Let me check if there's a notable figure with those exact dates. Let me think of French military leaders. 

Wait, there's also the case of the Duke of Choiseul, but he was born in 1719. No. Maybe someone from the War of Austrian Succession? That was 1740-1748. 

Wait, another thought: the person might be a general who was born in Germany but naturalized in France. Let me check. Oh! There's the case of the Duke of Wurtemberg, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to the Duke of Saxe-Gotha? No, that's a different region. 

Wait, perhaps the user is thinking of someone like the Duke of Broglie? No, he was born in 1718. 

Hmm, maybe I need to verify the dates for Maurice de Saxe again. Let me confirm. Maurice de Saxe was born on September 12, 1696, in Brunswick, Germany, and died on May 8, 1750, in Paris. So he was a German-born French general and statesman, but his death year is 1750, not 1755. The user's question says died in 1755. So maybe the user has the dates slightly wrong, or perhaps there's another person. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to someone else. Let me think of other possibilities. 

Wait, there's also the case of the Duke of Luxemburg, but he was born in 1670. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the Duke of Belle-Isle, who was a French general. He was born in 1684 and died in 1761. Still not matching. 

Wait, maybe the user is thinking of the Duke of La Rochefoucauld, but he was born in 1671. 

Hmm. Maybe the user is mistaken in the dates. If the person is known as a German-born French soldier and statesman, and the dates are 1700-1755, perhaps the correct answer is still Maurice de Saxe, even though his actual dates are 1696-1750. The user might have the birth year slightly off. Alternatively, maybe there's another figure. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the Duke of Gramont, but I don't think he was German-born. 

Wait, another angle: the person might have been a statesman as well as a soldier. So maybe someone in the French government. 

Wait, the Duke of Choiseul was a statesman, but born in 1719. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to the Duke of Saxe-Teschen? No, that's a different region. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the Duke of Wurttemberg, but again, not sure. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the Duke of Saxe-Weimar? No. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen? Not sure. 

Hmm. Given that the user's description is "German-born French soldier and statesmen (1700-1755)", and the most prominent figure that fits is Maurice de Saxe, even though his actual birth year is 1696 and death year 1750. Maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Alternatively, perhaps there's another person. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen? No. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg? No. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the Duke of Saxe-Eisenach? No. 

Hmm. Given that, I think the most likely answer is Maurice de Saxe, even though the dates don't perfectly match. The user might have the dates slightly wrong. Alternatively, maybe there's another person. 

Wait, let me check another source. Let me think of French military leaders born in the early 18th century. 

Another possibility: the Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre? No, he was born in 1759. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to the Duke of Duras? No. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the Duke of La Fayette? No, he was born in 1757. 

Hmm. Given the information, I think the best fit is Maurice de Saxe, even with the date discrepancy. The user might have the birth year as 1700 instead of 1696, or the death year as 1755 instead of 1750. Since the description matches him otherwise, I'll go with that.
