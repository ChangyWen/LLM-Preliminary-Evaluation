Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1889 and died in 1977, known as a British comic actor and filmmaker. Hmm, first, I need to think of British actors from that era who were comedians. The years 1889 to 1977... So they were active in the early to mid-20th century.

Charles Chaplin comes to mind. He was a famous comedian, but wait, was he British? I think he was born in the UK, right? His parents were musicians, and he started in the theater. He became a major figure in silent films. Let me check the dates. Charles Chaplin was born in 1889, April 16th, and he died in 1977, December 25th. That matches the years given. He was definitely a comic actor and filmmaker, known for his work in movies like "The Tramp" and "Modern Times." 

Another possibility might be someone like Stan Laurel, but he was born in 1890, so that's a year off. Buster Keaton was an American comedian, so probably not. Maybe someone else? Let me think. The user specified British, so Chaplin fits. He was a British subject, though he later became a US citizen. But his origins are British. 

I don't think there's another major British comic actor from that exact birth year. So the answer is likely Charles Chaplin. Let me confirm the death date again. Yes, he died in 1977. So that's the one.
