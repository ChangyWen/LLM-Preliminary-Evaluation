Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1890 and died in 1974, known as a Russian architect and painter. Hmm, first, I need to think of notable Russian artists and architects from that time period.

1890 to 1974... That's a span that includes the Russian Revolution, the Soviet era, and the mid-20th century. So maybe someone who was active during the Soviet Union's early years. The person is both an architect and a painter. Let me think of famous Russian architects and painters from that era.

El Lissitzky comes to mind. He was a Russian artist and architect, part of the Constructivist movement. He was born in 1890 and died in 1941, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1941? But the user says died in 1974. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up dates. Let me check my memory. El Lissitzky was born in 1890, but I think he died in 1941. So that doesn't fit the 1974 death date. Maybe another person.

Another name... Maybe Vladimir Tatlin? He was a Russian artist and architect, known for the Tatlin's Tower. He was born in 1885 and died in 1953. Still not 1974. What about someone else? Maybe someone who lived longer. Let me think. There's also Alexander Rodchenko, but he was a photographer and designer, born in 1891, died in 1959. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe it's someone from a different field. Let me check the dates again. The person was born in 1890 and died in 1974. So they lived 84 years. Let me think of Russian artists or architects who lived that long. Maybe someone like Kasimir Malevich? He was born in 1878 and died in 1935. No. Maybe someone from the later Soviet period? Wait, maybe it's not a Soviet figure. Maybe someone who emigrated?

Wait, there's also the name of a painter and architect who was part of the Bauhaus movement? Maybe someone like Theo van Doesburg? No, he was Dutch. Wait, maybe it's a different approach. Let me search my memory for the exact dates. The user says the person is known as a Russian architect and painter, born 1890-1974. Let me think again. Oh! Maybe it's Vladimir Baranoff-Rossin√©? He was a Russian painter and sculptor, but I'm not sure about the dates. Let me check. He was born in 1888 and died in 1945. Not matching.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's someone like Lyubov Popova? She was a Russian painter and designer, born in 1882, died in 1924. No. Hmm. Maybe the user is referring to someone who was active in both architecture and painting. Let me think of the 20th century. Oh! Maybe it's someone like Moisei Ginzburg? He was a Soviet architect, born in 1892, died in 1946. Still not 1974. 

Wait, maybe the person is not strictly from the Soviet Union but Russian. Let me think of someone who lived longer. For example, Igor Stravinsky was a composer, not architect. Maybe someone else. Wait, the user specified architect and painter. Let me try to recall. Oh! Maybe it's someone like Alexander Vesnin? He was part of the Vesnin brothers, architects. He was born in 1883 and died in 1959. Still not 1974. 

Wait, maybe the person is not as well-known. Let me try to think of the exact dates. The user says 1890-1974. Let me check if there's a notable figure with those exact dates. Oh! Wait, maybe it's someone like Marc Chagall? He was born in 1887 and died in 1985. He was a painter, but not an architect. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone who was active in both fields. Let me think again. Oh! Maybe it's someone like El Lissitzky, but I thought he died in 1941. Let me confirm. El Lissitzky was born on December 23, 1890, and died on December 30, 1941. So that's not 1974. 

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the death year? Or perhaps I'm missing someone. Let me think of other possibilities. There's also the name of a painter and architect who was part of the Suprematism movement. Maybe someone like Ilya Chashnik? He was born in 1909 and died in 1947. No. 

Wait, maybe the person is not Russian but associated with Russia. For example, Le Corbusier was a Swiss-French architect, but not Russian. Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to someone who was born in Russia but later emigrated. Let me think. For example, someone like Marc Chagall, but again, not an architect. 

Wait, maybe the answer is someone like Vladimir Ossipovitch? No, not sure. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone like Konstantin Melnikov, a Russian architect. He was born in 1890 and died in 1974. Yes! Konstantin Melnikov was a Russian architect, born on December 19, 1890, and died on December 28, 1974. He was known for his architectural work, including the Melnikov House in Moscow. He was also involved in design and painting. That fits the criteria. So the answer is Konstantin Melnikov.
