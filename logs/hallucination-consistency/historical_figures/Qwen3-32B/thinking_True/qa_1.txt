Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1732 and died in 1799, who was the first president of the United States. Hmm, I need to make sure I get the dates right. The person was born in 1732 and died in 1799, so their lifespan is 67 years. The first president of the US is a key figure in American history.

Wait, the first president is George Washington, right? Let me confirm the dates. George Washington was indeed born on February 22, 1732, and he died on December 14, 1799. That matches the years given. The user also mentioned the dates in parentheses as 1732–1799, which aligns with Washington's birth and death years. 

I should double-check if there's any other president who might have been the first, but I know that after the American Revolution, the first president elected under the Constitution was George Washington in 1789. He served two terms and then retired. So there's no confusion with other presidents here. 

Another thing to note is that the user wrote "1st president of the United States (1732–1799)" in the question. The parentheses here might be a bit confusing because the dates in parentheses usually denote the years a person was in office, but in this case, it's their lifespan. However, since the user specified the birth and death years, and the role as the first president, it's clear they're referring to George Washington. 

I don't think there's any other historical figure that fits these criteria. Maybe someone could mix up the dates with another Founding Father, but the key point is the first president. So the answer should be George Washington.
