Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1802 and died in 1885, known as a French poet, novelist, and dramatist. Hmm, I need to think of French writers from that time period.

First, let me check the years. 1802 to 1885. So they lived 83 years. Let me think of famous French authors around that time. Victor Hugo comes to mind. He was born in 1802 and died in 1885. Wait, yes, that matches the dates. He's known for works like "Les Mis√©rables" and "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame." He was a poet, novelist, and playwright, so that fits the description. 

But wait, are there any others? Maybe Alphonse Daudet? No, he was born in 1840. Stendhal? He died in 1842. Balzac? He died in 1850. So Victor Hugo is the one who fits the birth and death years. Let me confirm the dates again. Victor Hugo was born on February 26, 1802, and died on May 22, 1885. Yes, that's correct. He was definitely a poet, novelist, and dramatist. So the answer should be Victor Hugo.
