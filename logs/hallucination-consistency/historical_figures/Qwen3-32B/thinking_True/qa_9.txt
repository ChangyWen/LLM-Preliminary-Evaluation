Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1599 and died in 1660, known as a Spanish painter. Hmm, I need to think of Spanish painters from that time period.

First, I remember that the 17th century was a significant time for Spanish art, especially during the Baroque period. The most famous Spanish painter from that era is Diego Velázquez. Let me check his dates. Velázquez was born in 1599 and died in 1660. That matches the years given. He was a court painter for King Philip IV and is known for works like "Las Meninas." 

Wait, are there any other Spanish painters from that time with those exact birth and death years? Let me think. There's Francisco de Goya, but he was born in 1746, so that's too late. El Greco was Greek, though he worked in Spain, but he died in 1614, which is before 1599. So Velázquez seems to fit perfectly. 

I should confirm the dates again. Yes, Diego Velázquez was born on June 6, 1599, and died on August 6, 1660. That's correct. The user mentioned "Spanish painter (1599-1660)" so the answer is definitely Diego Velázquez. No other Spanish painter from that period has those exact dates. I think that's the one.
