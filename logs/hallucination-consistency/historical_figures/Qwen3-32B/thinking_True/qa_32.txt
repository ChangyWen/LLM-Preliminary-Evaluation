Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1783 and died in 1842, known as a 19th-century French writer. Hmm, first, I need to think of French writers from that time period. Let me start by calculating the lifespan. 1783 to 1842 is 59 years. So the person lived through the late 18th, early 19th century.

First, I'll think of famous French writers from the 19th century. The 19th century starts in 1801, so someone born in 1783 would be active during the early 1800s. Let me list some names. Victor Hugo comes to mind, but he was born in 1802, so that's too late. Alexandre Dumas? He was born in 1802 as well. Maybe someone a bit older. Stendhal? He was born in 1783! Wait, Stendhal's real name is Marie-Henri Beyle. Let me check his dates. Yes, he was born on January 23, 1783, and died on March 24, 1842. That fits perfectly. 

Stendhal was a prominent French writer known for works like "The Red and the Black" and "The Charterhouse of Parma." He was part of the Romantic movement but also had neoclassical elements in his work. His birth and death years match the user's query exactly. Let me double-check to make sure there's no other writer with the same dates. Maybe someone else? Balzac? He was born in 1799. Flaubert? 1821. No, definitely Stendhal. I think that's the correct answer.
