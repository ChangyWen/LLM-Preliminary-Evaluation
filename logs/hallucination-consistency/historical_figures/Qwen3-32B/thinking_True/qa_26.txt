Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1921, died in 1981, known as a French singer-songwriter and poet. Hmm. First, I need to think of French artists from that time period.

1921 to 1981... So they were 60 years old when they died. Let me think. Some famous French singers from that era... Maybe someone like Jacques Brel? Wait, Brel was born in 1929 and died in 1978. Close, but not the exact years. What about Serge Gainsbourg? He was born in 1928 and died in 1991. No, that's not matching. 

Wait, there's also someone like Ã‰dith Piaf. She was born in 1915 and died in 1963. Not the right years either. Maybe someone else. Let me check the years again. Born 1921, died 1981. So active during the mid-20th century. 

Oh! Could it be Georges Brassens? Let me confirm. Brassens was born on April 21, 1921, and died on October 25, 1981. Yes, that fits the dates. He was a French singer-songwriter and poet, known for his humorous and often bawdy songs, as well as his literary contributions. His works include "La Chanson des vieux amants" and "Le Chant des partisans." He's a significant figure in French chanson. 

I think that's the one. Let me double-check to make sure there's no other artist with those exact birth and death years. Another possibility might be someone like Charles Aznavour, but he was born in 1924 and is still alive. So no. So Georges Brassens seems to fit perfectly.
