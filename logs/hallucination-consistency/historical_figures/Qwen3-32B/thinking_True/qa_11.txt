Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1935 and died in 1977, known as an American singer and actor. Hmm. First, I need to think of famous people from that time frame.

1935 to 1977... That's a 42-year span. Let me narrow it down. The person was active as a singer and actor. Let's think of famous singers and actors from the mid-20th century. 

First thought: Elvis Presley. He was a big name, but he died in 1977. Wait, when was he born? Elvis was born in 1935, right? Let me check. Yes, Elvis Presley was born on January 8, 1935, and died on August 16, 1977. That fits the dates. He was definitely a singer and actor. He made a lot of movies, so that matches the description. 

Are there any other possibilities? Maybe someone else? Let me think. Frank Sinatra was born in 1915, so too early. John F. Kennedy was president, but he wasn't a singer. Marilyn Monroe died in 1962, so not 1977. Michael Jackson was born in 1958, so too late. James Dean was an actor but died in 1955. 

Another angle: The user mentioned "American singer and actor (1935–1977)" in the description. The parentheses might indicate the years they were active, but more likely it's their lifespan. Since Elvis was born and died in those years, and was both a singer and actor, that seems to fit. 

I think the answer is Elvis Presley. Let me just confirm the dates again. Yes, 1935-1977. Yep, that's correct. No one else comes to mind with those exact dates and the dual role as singer and actor. So the answer should be Elvis Presley.
