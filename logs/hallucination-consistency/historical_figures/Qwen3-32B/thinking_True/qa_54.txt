Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1606 and died in 1684, known as a French tragedian. Hmm, first, I need to recall French playwrights from that time period. The 17th century in France is known for its classical theater, so maybe someone like Molière? Wait, Molière was born in 1622 and died in 1673, so that's not matching the dates. What about Racine? Jean Racine comes to mind. Let me check his dates. Yes, he was born in 1639 and died in 1699. No, that's not right either.

Wait, the user specified 1606 to 1684. Let me think again. Oh, maybe Pierre Corneille? He was a French playwright. Let me confirm his dates. Pierre Corneille was born in 1606 and died in 1684. Yes, that fits. He's known for his tragedies like "Le Cid" and "Tartuffe," though I think "Tartuffe" is actually Molière's work. Wait, no, Corneille's major works include "Le Cid" and "Horace." Molière did write comedies, but Corneille was a tragedian. So the answer should be Pierre Corneille. Let me double-check the dates again to be sure. Yes, he was born on June 6, 1606, and died on October 1, 1684. That matches the user's question. So the answer is Pierre Corneille.
