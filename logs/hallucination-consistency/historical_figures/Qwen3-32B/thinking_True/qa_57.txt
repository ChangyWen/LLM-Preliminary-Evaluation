Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1926 and died in 2016. The person is known for being an Italian actor, playwright, comedian, singer-songwriter, theater director, painter, and political activist.

First, I need to think of Italian figures from that time period who fit all those roles. The name that comes to mind is Dario Fo. Let me check the dates. Dario Fo was born on December 24, 1926, and he passed away on October 13, 2016. That matches the years given. 

He was indeed a multifaceted individual. He was an actor, known for his work in theater and film. He wrote plays, so playwright fits. He was a comedian, especially with his work in commedia dell'arte. As a singer-songwriter, he was part of the Neapolitan song tradition. He directed theater productions, painted, and was very active in political movements, especially left-wing causes. 

I don't think there's another Italian figure from that era who fits all those roles. Maybe someone like Federico Fellini? But Fellini was a director and filmmaker, not a playwright or comedian in the same way. Or perhaps someone like Tot√≤, but he died earlier, in 1967. So Dario Fo seems to be the correct answer here. Let me just confirm his death date again. Yes, 2016. Okay, that's solid.
