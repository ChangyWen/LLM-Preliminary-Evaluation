Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1896 and died in 1940. The key details given are that this person was an Italian Marshal of the Air Force and a minister. 

First, I need to recall Italian military figures from that time period. The years 1896 to 1940 place this person in the early to mid-20th century. Since they were a Marshal of the Air Force, that suggests they were involved in the Italian Royal Air Force, which was part of the Royal Italian Army before World War II.

The title "Marshal of the Air Force" is a high rank, so this person must have been a significant figure in Italy's military aviation. Also, they served as a minister, which could be a government position, possibly related to defense or another department.

I'm trying to think of Italian military leaders from that era. The most prominent names that come to mind are related to Benito Mussolini's regime. For example, Italo Balbo was a notable figure. He was a general and a leader in the Fascist Party. Let me check his dates. Italo Balbo was born in 1896 and died in 1940. That matches the birth and death years given. 

Balbo was indeed a Marshal of the Air Force in Italy. He was also a minister, specifically the Minister of the Corporations and later the Minister of the Colonies. He was a key figure in the Fascist government and played a role in the development of the Italian air force. His death in 1940 was during a flight accident, which fits the timeline.

Another possibility might be someone like Pietro Badoglio, but he was more of a general and prime minister, not specifically an air force marshal. So I think Italo Balbo is the correct answer here. Let me confirm once more: born 1896, died 1940, Italian Marshal of the Air Force, and served as a minister. Yes, that all lines up with Italo Balbo.
