Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1883 and died in 1924, known as a Bohemian novelist and short story writer. First, I need to figure out who that could be.

Bohemian might refer to someone from the Czech Republic, which was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the time. The person is a novelist and short story writer. Let me think of famous authors from that region and time period. Franz Kafka comes to mind. He was born in 1883 and died in 1924. He's known for works like "The Metamorphosis" and "The Trial." 

Wait, but Kafka is usually associated with German literature, even though he was born in what is now the Czech Republic. The term "Bohemian" can sometimes be used to describe people from Bohemia, which is a historical region in the Czech Republic. So even though he wrote in German, he was a Bohemian by birth. That fits the description. 

Let me double-check the dates. Kafka was born on July 3, 1883, and died on June 3, 1924. Yes, that matches. His works are indeed considered part of the modernist and absurdist movements. So the answer should be Franz Kafka. I don't think there's another prominent author from that time and place with those dates. Maybe someone else? Let me think. Maybe a less-known figure? But Kafka is the most famous one that fits. I think that's the correct answer.
