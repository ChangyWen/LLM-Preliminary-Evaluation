Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1840 and died in 1926, known as a French impressionist painter. Hmm, first, I need to recall the key French impressionist painters. The main ones that come to mind are Monet, Renoir, Degas, Cassatt, Sisley, Pissarro, and maybe Cézanne, though Cézanne is sometimes considered a post-impressionist.

Now, checking the birth and death years. Monet was born in 1840 and died in 1926. Let me confirm that. Yes, Claude Monet was born on November 14, 1840, and died on December 5, 1926. That fits perfectly. Renoir was born in 1841, so that's a year later. Degas was born in 1834, so earlier. So Monet is the one that matches the given years. The user also specified "French impressionist painter," and Monet is one of the most famous and central figures of the Impressionist movement. He's known for works like "Water Lilies" and "Impression, Sunrise," which actually gave the movement its name. So putting it all together, the answer should be Claude Monet.
