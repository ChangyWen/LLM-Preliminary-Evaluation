Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1162 and died in 1227, who is known as the founder and first khan of the Mongol Empire. Hmm, I need to recall who that might be.

First, I remember that the Mongol Empire was established by a leader who united the Mongol tribes. The most famous name associated with the Mongol Empire is Genghis Khan. But wait, I should verify the dates. Genghis Khan was born in 1162, right? And he died in 1227. Yes, that matches the years given here. 

Let me double-check. Genghis Khan, also known as Temüjin, was indeed the founder of the Mongol Empire. He was born around 1162 and died in 1227. His real name was Temüjin, but he was given the title "Genghis Khan" after uniting the tribes. So the answer should be Genghis Khan. I don't think there's another figure from that time period who fits these criteria. Other Mongol leaders came after him, like Kublai Khan, but he was his grandson and founded the Yuan Dynasty in China. So yeah, the answer is definitely Genghis Khan.
