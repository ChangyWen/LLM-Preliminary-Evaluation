Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1775 and died in 1836, known as a French physicist and mathematician. Hmm, first, I need to recall who was active in that time period. Let me think about French scientists from the late 18th to early 19th century.

1775 to 1836... So someone who was born during the American Revolution and died before the middle of the 19th century. Let me list some French physicists and mathematicians. There's Laplace, but he was born in 1749 and died in 1827. Not quite. Fourier? He was born in 1768 and died in 1830. Still not matching the dates. How about Ampère? André-Marie Ampère was a French physicist and mathematician. Let me check his dates. He was born in 1775 and died in 1836. That fits perfectly. 

Wait, Ampère is known for his work in electromagnetism, right? The unit of electric current is the ampere, named after him. He contributed to the understanding of electromagnetism, which is a key area in physics. Also, he did mathematical work. So that seems to fit the description. Let me double-check another possibility. There's also Fresnel, the physicist who worked on optics, but he was born in 1788 and died in 1827. No, that's not it. 

Another name could be Poisson, but he was born in 1781 and died in 1840. Doesn't match the death year. So Ampère seems to be the correct answer here. Let me confirm once more. Yes, André-Marie Ampère was born on January 22, 1775, and died on June 10, 1836. He was a French physicist and mathematician, known for his foundational work in electromagnetism. The answer should be Ampère.
