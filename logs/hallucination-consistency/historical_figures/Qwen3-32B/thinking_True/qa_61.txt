Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1891, died in 1940, known as a Russian author. Hmm. First, I need to think of Russian authors from that time period. Let me start by recalling some famous Russian writers.

The 19th and early 20th centuries had a lot of notable authors. The big names like Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov come to mind, but they were born earlier. Tolstoy was born in 1828, Dostoevsky in 1821, and Chekhov in 1860. So they're all before 1891. The user is looking for someone born in 1891, so maybe a younger contemporary of these authors.

Wait, 1891 to 1940. Let me think. The Soviet era started in 1917, so this person would have been active during that time. Maybe someone like Boris Pasternak? He was born in 1890, so that's close but not 1891. His most famous work is "Doctor Zhivago," published in 1957. But he died in 1960, so that's not matching the death year of 1940.

Another possibility is Mikhail Bulgakov. He was born in 1891, which fits the birth year. He's known for "The Master and Margarita." Let me check his death year. Bulgakov died in 1940, yes. That matches the criteria. So he was born in 1891, died in 1940, and is a Russian author. That seems to fit perfectly.

Wait, are there any other authors from that time? Let me double-check. Maybe someone else? For example, Osip Mandelstam was a poet, born in 1891, but he died in 1938. So not 1940. Anna Akhmatova was born in 1889, so not 1891. So Bulgakov seems to be the correct answer here. Let me confirm the dates again. Yes, Mikhail Bulgakov was born on May 11, 1891, and died on March 10, 1940. His most famous work is "The Master and Margarita," which was written in the 1920s and 1930s but published posthumously in 1967. So he definitely fits the description. I think that's the right answer.
