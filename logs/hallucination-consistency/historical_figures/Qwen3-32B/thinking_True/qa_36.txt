Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1822 and died in 1895, known as a French chemist and microbiologist. Hmm, I need to think of notable scientists from that time period.

First, the dates: 1822 to 1895. Let me recall some famous French scientists. Louis Pasteur comes to mind. He was a microbiologist and chemist, right? He did work on pasteurization, vaccines, and germ theory. Let me check the dates. Louis Pasteur was born on December 27, 1822, and died on September 28, 1895. That matches the years given. 

Wait, are there any other French chemists or microbiologists from that era with those exact birth and death years? Maybe someone else? Let me think. Antoine Lavoisier was a chemist, but he was born in 1743 and died in 1794, so that's too early. Marie Curie was born in 1867, so later. So Pasteur seems to fit perfectly. His contributions to microbiology, like disproving spontaneous generation, developing pasteurization, and creating vaccines for rabies and anthrax. Yeah, that all lines up. I think that's the answer.
