Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1809 and died in 1882. They also mention that this person was a British naturalist and the author of "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection." 

First, I need to recall who wrote "On the Origin of Species." I think it's Charles Darwin. Let me check the dates. Darwin was born in 1809 and died in 1882, which matches the years given. He was indeed a British naturalist, so that fits. The title of the book is correct as well. 

Wait, are there any other possible candidates? Maybe someone else who wrote a similar work? I don't think so. The key points here are the birth and death years, the nationality, the profession as a naturalist, and the specific book title. All of these point to Charles Darwin. 

I should also make sure there's no confusion with Alfred Russel Wallace, who also contributed to the theory of evolution by natural selection. However, Wallace wasn't the author of that specific book. Darwin is the one most associated with it. 

So, putting it all together, the answer should be Charles Darwin.
