Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1877 and died in 1960, who was a Chilean army officer and political figure. Hmm, I need to think about Chilean leaders from that time period.

First, I should check the years. 1877 to 1960. So they were active in the early 20th century. Chilean military figures... Maybe someone involved in the government or military reforms. Let me recall. There's a name that comes to mind: Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. Wait, he was a Chilean general and president. Let me verify the dates. Carlos Ibáñez was born in 1877 and died in 1960. That matches the years given. He served as president of Chile twice, in the 1920s and 1950s. He was known for his military background and political career. Yes, that seems to fit. I think that's the person they're referring to. Let me double-check to make sure there's no other Chilean figure with similar details. Another possibility could be someone else, but I can't recall another prominent Chilean from that exact time frame with those roles. So I'm pretty confident it's Carlos Ibáñez del Campo.
