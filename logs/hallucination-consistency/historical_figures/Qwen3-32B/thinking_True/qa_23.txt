Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1934 and died in 1996. They were an American astrophysicist, cosmologist, author, and science educator. Hmm, I need to think of someone who fits that description.

First, the time frame: 1934 to 1996. Let me think of notable scientists from that era. Carl Sagan comes to mind. He was a prominent figure in astronomy and science communication. Let me check his birth and death years. Yes, Carl Sagan was born on November 9, 1934, and died on December 20, 1996. That matches the dates given. 

He was definitely an astrophysicist and cosmologist. He worked on the Voyager missions, contributed to the search for extraterrestrial life, and wrote several popular science books, like "Cosmos" and "The Demon-Haunted World." He was also a science educator, hosting the TV series "Cosmos: A Personal Voyage," which made complex scientific concepts accessible to the public. 

I don't think there's another person who fits all those criteria. Let me double-check. Maybe someone else? Let's see. Stephen Hawking was British and lived longer, so that's not it. Neil deGrasse Tyson is still alive. So yes, Carl Sagan is the one. The answer should be Carl Sagan.
