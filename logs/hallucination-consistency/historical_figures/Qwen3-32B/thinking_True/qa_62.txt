Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1360 and died in 1428, known as a medieval Russian artist. Hmm, I need to recall Russian medieval artists from that time period.

First, I know that the 14th and 15th centuries in Russia were part of the medieval period, and there were several important iconographers. The most famous ones are usually associated with the Moscow school. The name that comes to mind is Andrei Rublev. Wait, but when was he born and died? Let me think. Rublev is often cited as one of the greatest icon painters, and his work includes the Trinity icon. I think he was active in the early 15th century. If he was born around 1360 and died in 1430, that fits the dates given here. The user's dates are 1360-1428, which is close. Maybe there's some variation in the exact dates, but Rublev is the most likely candidate. Another possibility might be Daniel Chernov, but I think he was a bit later. Let me double-check. Rublev's death is sometimes listed as 1430, but the user says 1428. Maybe different sources have slightly different dates. Given the time frame and the prominence of Rublev as a medieval Russian artist, I'm pretty confident the answer is Andrei Rublev.
