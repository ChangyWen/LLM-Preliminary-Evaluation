Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1473 and died in 1543. They were a Renaissance-era mathematician, astronomer, and clergyman known for the heliocentric model. Hmm, heliocentric model... that's the idea that the Sun is at the center of the universe, right? So I'm thinking of Copernicus. Let me check the dates. Nicolaus Copernicus was born in 1473 and died in 1543. Yes, that matches. He was a Polish astronomer who proposed the heliocentric theory, which challenged the geocentric model. He was also a cleric, I believe, part of the Catholic Church. So putting it all together, the answer should be Nicolaus Copernicus. Let me just make sure there's no one else with similar details. No, I think that's correct. The key points are the heliocentric model and the dates. Yep, definitely Copernicus.
