Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1821 and died in 1867. They also mention that this person was a French poet, essayist, and art critic. Hmm, I need to think of someone from that time period in France who fits those roles.

First, I'll note the dates: 1821 to 1867. That's a lifespan of 46 years. Let me think of famous French poets from the 19th century. Baudelaire comes to mind. Charles Baudelaire was a poet, and he was involved in art criticism as well. Let me check his dates. Baudelaire was born in 1821 and died in 1867. Yes, that matches exactly. 

Wait, are there any other possibilities? Maybe Théophile Gautier? He was a poet and critic too. But I think Gautier was born in 1811 and died in 1872. So that doesn't fit the dates. Another name could be Stéphane Mallarmé, but he was born in 1842, so too late. 

So Baudelaire is the most likely candidate. He's well-known for his poetry collection "Les Fleurs du Mal" and his essays on art, including his famous essay on Delacroix. His work as an art critic is a key part of his legacy. The dates align perfectly with the question. I don't think there's another prominent figure from that exact time period who fits all three roles. Therefore, the answer should be Charles Baudelaire.
