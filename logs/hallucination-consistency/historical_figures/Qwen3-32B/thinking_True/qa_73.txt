Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1867 and died in 1935. The description mentions they were a Polish politician, First Marshall, and Prime Minister. First, I need to confirm the correct name.

Wait, the birth year is 1867, and death in 1935. So the person lived 68 years. The title "First Marshall" might be a translation of "First Marshal," which in Polish is "Pierwszy Marszałek." The Prime Minister part is also important. 

I recall that Józef Piłsudski was a significant Polish leader. Let me check his dates. Piłsudski was born in 1867 and died in 1935. That matches the years given. He was a key figure in Poland's independence after World War I. He served as the Chief of State (Naczelnik) and later as the First Marshal of Poland. He also held the position of Prime Minister at different times. 

Wait, the title "First Marshall" might be a bit confusing. In Polish, "Marszałek" can refer to a marshal, and Piłsudski was indeed the First Marshal of Poland. The term "Marshall" here is part of his title, not necessarily a military rank. So putting it all together, Józef Piłsudski fits the description. 

I should double-check if there's another Polish leader with similar titles and dates. Let me think. Roman Dmowski was another prominent figure, but he was born in 1864 and died in 1939. So the dates don't match. So it's definitely Piłsudski. 

Yes, Józef Piłsudski was born on December 5, 1867, and died on May 12, 1935. He was a statesman, military leader, and the de facto leader of Poland between 1918 and 1922, then again from 1926 until his death. His titles include First Marshal of Poland and Prime Minister. So the answer should be Józef Piłsudski.
