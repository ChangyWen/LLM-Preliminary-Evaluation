Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1564 and died in 1642. They mention that the person was an Italian mathematician, physicist, philosopher, and astronomer. Hmm, I need to think of someone from that time period.

First, 1564 to 1642... That's a 78-year lifespan. Let me recall some famous scientists from the Renaissance or early modern period. Galileo Galilei comes to mind. He was an Italian, right? And he was definitely into astronomy, physics, and mathematics. I think he was born in 1564. Let me check the dates. Yes, Galileo was born on February 15, 1564, and died on January 8, 1642. That matches the years given. 

Wait, are there any other notable figures from that time? Maybe someone like Johannes Kepler? But Kepler was German, not Italian. And his dates are 1571-1630, so that doesn't fit. What about Copernicus? He was Polish, and he died in 1543, so too early. Then there's Descartes, but he was French and lived from 1596 to 1650, so not matching the dates. 

Galileo definitely fits the description. He made significant contributions to the scientific revolution, like improving the telescope, supporting the heliocentric model, and his work on motion. He was also a philosopher, as the question mentions. So I'm pretty confident the answer is Galileo Galilei. Let me just confirm the birth and death years again to be sure. Yes, 1564-1642. Yep, that's correct.
