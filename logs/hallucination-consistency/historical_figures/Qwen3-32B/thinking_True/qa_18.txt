Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1915 and died in 2006, who was a general and politician in Chile. Hmm, I need to think about Chilean leaders from that time period.

First, I remember that Augusto Pinochet was a significant figure in Chile. He was a military leader and ruled as a dictator. Let me check the dates. Pinochet was born in 1915, right? And he died in 2006. Yes, that matches the years given. He was a general in the Chilean army and later became the president, though his presidency was authoritarian. He took power through a coup in 1973, overthrew the democratically elected president Salvador Allende. His regime was known for human rights abuses, and he was eventually arrested and faced legal issues later in life. 

I think that's the person they're referring to. Let me confirm there aren't any other Chilean generals from that era with similar dates. I don't recall another prominent figure fitting that description. So the answer should be Augusto Pinochet.
