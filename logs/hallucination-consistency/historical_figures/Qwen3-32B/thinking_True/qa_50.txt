Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1622 and died in 1673, known as a French playwright and actor. Hmm, first, I need to recall French playwrights from that time period. The 17th century in France was the age of classic drama, so names like Molière, Racine, and Corneille come to mind.

Molière is a big one. He was a famous playwright and actor. Let me check his dates. I think Molière was born in 1622. Wait, yes, I remember reading that he was born on January 15, 1622, and died on February 17, 1673. That matches the years given. His full name is Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, but he's known by his stage name Molière. He wrote comedies like "Tartuffe" and "The Misanthrope," and he was also an actor. So that fits the description. 

Let me double-check the other playwrights. Jean Racine was born in 1639, so that's later. Pierre Corneille was born in 1606 and died in 1684. So he's not the one. So the only one that fits the birth and death years is Molière. I think that's the answer. The user might be looking for the name Molière, but maybe they want the full name. But since the question specifies the name as the historical figure known for being a French playwright and actor, Molière is the correct answer.
