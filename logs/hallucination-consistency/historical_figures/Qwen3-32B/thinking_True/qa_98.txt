Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1683 and died in 1764, known as a French Baroque composer and music theorist. Hmm, first, I need to recall who fits these criteria.

The Baroque period was roughly from 1600 to 1750, so 1683-1764 would place this person towards the end of that era. French Baroque composers... I know Jean-Philippe Rameau comes to mind. He was a significant figure in French Baroque music. Let me check his dates. Rameau was born in 1683 and died in 1764. That matches the years given. 

Additionally, he's known for both his compositions and his work in music theory. He wrote treatises on harmony, which were influential. So that fits the description of a composer and music theorist. 

Wait, are there any other French composers from that time? François Couperin is another name, but he was born in 1668 and died in 1733, so the dates don't match. Jean-Baptiste Lully was earlier, in the 17th century. So Rameau is the one that fits the birth and death years. 

I think that's the correct answer. Let me just confirm once more. Rameau's contributions include operas and theoretical works like "Traité de l'harmonie," which was important in the development of Western music theory. Yes, that all lines up. The user is probably looking for Jean-Philippe Rameau.
