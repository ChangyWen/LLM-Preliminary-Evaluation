Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1879 and died in 1941, known as a Chilean politician and president. First, I need to check the dates. Wait, the person was born in 1879 and died in 1941, so their lifespan is 62 years. The user also mentions they were a president of Chile.

I should think about Chilean presidents around that time. Let me recall. The 20th century Chilean presidents... There's Pedro Aguirre Cerda, who was president in the 1930s. He was born in 1879 and died in 1941. That matches the dates given. Let me verify. Pedro Aguirre Cerda was indeed the president of Chile from 1938 until his death in 1941. His presidency was during the Popular Front government. He was a member of the Radical Party. The dates align perfectly: born in 1879, died in 1941. I don't think there's another Chilean president with those exact birth and death years. Another possibility might be someone else, but I can't recall another Chilean president from that period with those dates. So the answer is likely Pedro Aguirre Cerda.
