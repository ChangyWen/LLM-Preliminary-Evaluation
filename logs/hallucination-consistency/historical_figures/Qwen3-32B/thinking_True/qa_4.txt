Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1756 and died in 1791, known as an Austrian composer of the Classical period. Hmm, first, I need to recall composers from that time. The Classical period in music is roughly from the mid-18th to early 19th century. The years given are 1756 to 1791. Let me think of composers from that era.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart comes to mind. He was born in 1756 and died in 1791. He was Austrian, right? Yes, he was born in Salzburg, which is in Austria. He's one of the most famous composers of the Classical period. Other composers like Haydn were also from that time, but Haydn was born in 1732 and died in 1809, so that doesn't fit the dates. Beethoven was born in 1770, so later. So Mozart fits the birth and death years. Let me double-check the dates. Mozart's birthdate is January 27, 1756, and he died on December 5, 1791. That matches exactly. He's definitely known as an Austrian composer from the Classical period. I don't think there's another composer with those exact dates. So the answer should be Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
