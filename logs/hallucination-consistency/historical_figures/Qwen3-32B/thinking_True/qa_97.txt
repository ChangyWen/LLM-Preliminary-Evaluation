Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1265 and died in 1321, known as an Italian poet. Hmm, I need to think about Italian poets from that time period. The 13th and early 14th century... Dante Alighieri comes to mind. He's a very famous Italian poet, right? He wrote the Divine Comedy. Let me check the dates. Dante was born in 1265 and died in 1321. That matches the years given. I don't think there are many other Italian poets from that exact time frame who are as renowned. Maybe Petrarch? But Petrarch was born later, like in 1304. So no, that's not it. Boccaccio was also later. So yes, Dante is the one. The user probably wants the answer to be Dante Alighieri. Let me just confirm the dates again to be sure. Yes, Dante was born on June 5, 1265, and died on September 14, 1321. Definitely fits. So the answer should be Dante Alighieri.
