Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1879 and died in 1955. The clue given is that they were a German-born theoretical physicist known for developing the theory of relativity.

First, I need to recall who the most famous physicist associated with the theory of relativity is. Albert Einstein comes to mind immediately. He's widely recognized for his work on both the special and general theories of relativity. Let me check the dates. Einstein was indeed born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, and he passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey. 

I should make sure there aren't any other physicists from that time period who might fit the description. For example, someone like Max Planck, but Planck is more known for quantum theory. Others like Niels Bohr or Marie Curie don't fit the relativity part. The key here is the theory of relativity, which is Einstein's most famous contribution. 

Also, the user specified "German-born," and Einstein was born in Germany, though he later became a Swiss and then American citizen. But the birthplace is correct. The dates match exactly. I don't think there's another physicist with the same birth and death years who developed the theory of relativity. 

So putting it all together, the answer must be Albert Einstein. The user probably wants the full name, but since the clue already mentions "German-born theoretical physicist," and the answer is so well-known, just stating Albert Einstein should suffice. Let me double-check the dates once more to be certain. Yes, 1879–1955 is correct for Einstein. No conflicting information here. I think that's solid.
