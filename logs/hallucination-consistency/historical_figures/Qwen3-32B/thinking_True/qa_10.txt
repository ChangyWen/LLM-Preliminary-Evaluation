Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1541 and died in 1614, known as a Greek painter, sculptor, and architect. Hmm, first, I need to check if there's a well-known Greek artist from that time period. The 16th century... Maybe someone from the Renaissance? But Greece was under Ottoman rule during that time, so maybe not as prominent in Western art history.

Wait, the name that comes to mind is El Greco. Let me verify. El Greco was born in 1541 in Crete, which was part of the Venetian Republic then, so technically Greek. He died in 1614. He was a painter, sculptor, and architect. Yes, he's famous for his unique style blending Byzantine traditions with Mannerism. His full name is Domenikos Theotokopoulos. So that must be the answer. Let me double-check the dates. Born 1541, died 1614. Yes, that's correct. He worked in Spain, especially in Toledo. So the answer should be El Greco.
