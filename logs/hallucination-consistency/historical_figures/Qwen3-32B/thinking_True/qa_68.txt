Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1858 and died in 1930, a Chilean politician and president. First, I need to confirm the dates. The person lived from 1858 to 1930, so that's 72 years. Now, Chilean president during that time... Let me think.

I remember that Chile had several presidents in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The name that comes to mind is Pedro Lagos. Wait, was he born in 1858? Let me check. Pedro Lagos was president from 1906 to 1910. His birth year is 1858, and he died in 1930. That matches the dates given. 

Another possibility might be someone else, but I need to be sure. Let me cross-verify. If I recall correctly, Pedro Lagos was indeed a Chilean president during that period. His full name is Pedro Pablo Lagos Bustos. He was part of the Conservative Party. His presidency was during a time of political instability in Chile, and he was known for his efforts to stabilize the government. 

I don't think there's another Chilean president from that exact time frame with those birth and death years. Let me think of other Chilean presidents. For example, Jorge Montt was president from 1891 to 1896, but he was born in 1838 and died in 1909. That doesn't fit. Then there's Alessandri Palma, but he was born in 1875. So Pedro Lagos seems to be the correct answer here. 

Yes, I'm pretty confident that the answer is Pedro Pablo Lagos. The dates and the role as a Chilean president all line up. I'll go with that.
