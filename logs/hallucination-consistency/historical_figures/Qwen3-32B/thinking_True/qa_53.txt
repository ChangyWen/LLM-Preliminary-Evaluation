Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1639 and died in 1699, known as a French dramatist. Hmm, I need to think of French playwrights from that time period.

First, I remember that Molière was a famous French playwright. Let me check his dates. Molière was born in 1622 and died in 1673. Wait, that doesn't match the years given here. The user said 1639-1699. So Molière is out.

Another name that comes to mind is Jean Racine. Let me verify his dates. Racine was born in 1639 and died in 1699. Yes, that fits perfectly. He was a French dramatist known for tragedies like "Phèdre" and "Andromaque." So that must be the answer. I should make sure there aren't any other playwrights from that exact period. Maybe Pierre Corneille? He was born in 1606 and died in 1684. No, that's not matching. So Jean Racine is the correct one here.
