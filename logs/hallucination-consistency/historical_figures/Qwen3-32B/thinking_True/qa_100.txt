Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1803 and died in 1869, known as a French Romantic composer. Hmm, first, I need to recall French composers from the Romantic era. The Romantic period in music is roughly from the early 19th century to the mid-19th century. So someone born in 1803 would be active during that time.

Let me think of famous French composers. There's Debussy, but he was born in 1862, so that's too late. Frédéric Chopin comes to mind, but he was Polish, not French. Then there's Hector Berlioz. Wait, when was he born? I think Berlioz was born in 1803. Let me check the dates. Yes, Hector Berlioz was born on December 11, 1803, and he died on March 8, 1869. That matches the years given. He's definitely a French composer and a key figure in the Romantic period. His works include the Symphonie fantastique, which is a famous piece from that era. So I'm pretty confident the answer is Hector Berlioz. Let me just make sure there aren't any other composers with those exact birth and death years. Maybe someone like Meyerbeer? Giacomo Meyerbeer was a German-born composer who worked in France, but he was born in 1791 and died in 1864, so the dates don't match. Another possibility is Louis-Nicolas Clérambault, but he was earlier. No, Berlioz is the one that fits. Yeah, I think that's the right answer.
