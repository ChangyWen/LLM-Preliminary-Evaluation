Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1868, died in 1950, a Chilean politician and president. First, I need to recall Chilean presidents from that time period. Let me think about the years. If they were president, their term would be between 1868 and 1950. Let's break down the dates. Someone born in 1868 would be around 82 when they died in 1950. So they were active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Chilean presidents during that era... I remember that there were several presidents in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Let me think. One notable president was Pedro Lagos, but I think he was president in the 1920s. Wait, Pedro Lagos was president from 1920 to 1924. But he was born in 1868. Let me check that. If he was born in 1868 and died in 1950, that fits. So Pedro Lagos would be the answer. But I need to confirm. Another possibility is that there might be another president with similar dates. Let me think of other Chilean presidents. For example, Jorge Montt was president in the early 1900s, but he was born in 1860 and died in 1952. Not quite. Then there's Arturo Alessandri Palma, who was president in the 1920s. He was born in 1868 and died in 1950. Wait, that's the same dates as the question. So Arturo Alessandri Palma was born in 1868 and died in 1950. He was a Chilean president. Let me verify. Arturo Alessandri was president from 1920 to 1924 and then again in 1932. His birth and death years are 1868-1950. So that matches the user's query. But earlier I thought of Pedro Lagos, but Pedro Lagos was born in 1868 as well? Wait, no, Pedro Lagos was born in 1871. Let me check. Arturo Alessandri Palma is the one born in 1868. So the correct answer should be Arturo Alessandri Palma. I need to make sure there's no confusion with other presidents. Another check: the user mentioned "Chilean politician and President," so the person must have been president. Arturo Alessandri was indeed a president of Chile. So the answer is Arturo Alessandri Palma.
