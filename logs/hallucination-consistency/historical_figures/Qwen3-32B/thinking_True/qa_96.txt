Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1785 and died in 1873, known as an Italian poet and novelist. Hmm, I need to think of Italian writers from that time period.

First, I'll check the years. 1785 to 1873 is a span of 88 years. The person lived through the early 19th century, which was a time of significant change in Italy, including the Risorgimento movement. So maybe someone involved in that era's literature.

Italian poets and novelists... Let me think. Alessandro Manzoni comes to mind. He was a prominent figure in Italian literature. Let me verify his dates. Manzoni was born in 1785 and died in 1873. Yes, that matches the years given. He's known for his novel "I Promessi Sposi" (The Betrothed), which is a classic in Italian literature. He was also a poet and a key figure in the development of the modern Italian language. 

Another possibility might be Giacomo Leopardi, but he died in 1837, which is too early. Ugo Foscolo is another name, but he died in 1827. So Manzoni is the one who fits the timeline. I think that's the correct answer here. Let me just double-check to make sure there's no other Italian writer with those exact birth and death years. A quick mental list: Dante Alighieri is way earlier, Petrarch too. The 19th century Italians... Manzoni is the one. Yep, I'm pretty confident it's Alessandro Manzoni.
