Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1821 and died in 1881, known as a Russian author. Hmm, first, I need to recall Russian authors from that time period. Let me think. The 19th century had some big names. Fyodor Dostoevsky comes to mind. Wait, when was he born? I think he was born in 1821. Let me check the dates. Dostoevsky was born on November 11, 1821, and he died on February 9, 1881. That matches the years given. So the answer should be Fyodor Dostoevsky. But wait, are there any other authors from that time? Maybe Leo Tolstoy? No, Tolstoy was born in 1828 and died in 1910, so that's not it. Anton Chekhov was later, in the 1860s. So yes, Dostoevsky fits the dates. Let me confirm again. 1821-1881, Russian author. Definitely Dostoevsky. He wrote famous works like "Crime and Punishment," "The Brothers Karamazov," and "Notes from Underground." Yeah, that's the one.
