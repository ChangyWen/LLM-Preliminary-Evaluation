Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1879 and died in 1954, known as an Australian writer and feminist. Hmm. First, I need to recall notable Australians from that time period. Let me think... 1879 to 1954. So they lived 75 years. Let me break it down.

Australian writers... Maybe someone like Henry Lawson? But he was born in 1867 and died in 1922, so that's not matching the dates. Then there's Banjo Paterson, but he was born in 1864 and died in 1941. Still not the right years. Wait, the user mentioned feminist. So maybe a female writer? Let me think of prominent Australian female writers from that era.

Hmm. Mary Gilmore comes to mind. She was a poet and writer. Let me check her dates. Mary Gilmore was born in 1865 and died in 1962. That's not matching. What about Miles Franklin? She's a well-known Australian author. Let me confirm her birth and death years. Miles Franklin was born in 1879 and died in 1954. Yes! That fits the dates. She's famous for her novel "My Brilliant Career" and was a feminist. So the answer should be Miles Franklin. Let me double-check to make sure there's no other person with similar details. Another possibility could be Nettie Palmer, but she was born in 1885. So no. Definitely, Miles Franklin fits the criteria.
