Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1524 and died in 1580, known as a Portuguese poet. Hmm, I need to recall Portuguese poets from that time period.

First, I know that the 16th century in Portugal was the Golden Age of Portuguese literature. The most famous names that come to mind are Luís de Camões and António Ferreira. Let me check their dates. Luís de Camões is the author of "The Lusiads," right? He was born around 1524 or 1525 and died in 1580. That fits the years given. António Ferreira was another poet, but I think he died earlier, maybe in the 1550s. So Camões is the more likely answer here. 

Wait, let me confirm the exact dates. Camões was born in 1524 or 1525, depending on the source, and died on June 15, 1580. The user specified 1524 and 1580, so that matches. He's definitely the most renowned Portuguese poet of that era. Another possibility could be Francisco de Sá de Miranda, but he died in 1558, so that's too early. So yes, Luís de Camões is the correct answer.
