Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1937, died in 2012, known as a Dutch writer and translator. Hmm. First, I need to think of notable Dutch writers and translators from that time period.

1937 to 2012... Let me calculate their age. If they were born in 1937 and died in 2012, they were 75 years old. Now, who are the famous Dutch writers around that time? I know someone like Cees Nooteboom comes to mind. Wait, when was he born? Let me recall. Cees Nooteboom was born in 1933, so that's a bit earlier. Then there's someone else. Maybe Harry Mulisch? He was a prominent Dutch writer. Let me check his dates. Harry Mulisch was born in 1927 and died in 2010. Close, but not exact. The death year is 2010, not 2012. 

Another name that comes to mind is Jan Wolkers. He was a Dutch writer and translator. Let me verify his dates. Jan Wolkers was born in 1925 and died in 1999. No, that's not matching. 

Wait, what about someone like Willem Frederik Hermans? He was a significant Dutch author. He was born in 1921 and died in 1995. Still not matching. 

Hmm. Maybe it's a female author? Let me think. There's someone like Simone van der Vlugt, but I'm not sure about her dates. Alternatively, maybe someone like C. Buddingh'? He was born in 1924 and died in 1999. No. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to someone less known? Or maybe a translator who was also a writer. Let me think again. The death year is 2012. Let me check if there's a Dutch writer who died in 2012. A quick search in my memory... Oh! I think it's someone like Jan van Pelt. Wait, no, he's a historian. 

Wait, maybe it's someone like Hella Haasse. She was a Dutch writer. Let me check her dates. Hella Haasse was born in 1918 and died in 2011. Close to 2012, but not exact. 

Wait, another thought: the user mentioned both writer and translator. Maybe someone who translated works into Dutch or from Dutch. Let me think. There's someone like Dick van der Laan? Not sure. 

Wait, I'm not getting the right person. Let me try to think of the years again. Born 1937, died 2012. So they were active during the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s. Maybe someone like Janwillem van den Berg? He was a Dutch writer and translator. Let me check his dates. Janwillem van den Berg was born in 1924 and died in 2000. No. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to someone like Cees Nooteboom, but I thought he was born in 1933. Let me confirm. Yes, Cees Nooteboom was born in 1933, so that's not matching. 

Wait, maybe it's someone like Harry T. Peters? No, he's a writer but not sure about the dates. 

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of Dutch writers who died in 2012. Let me think of the year 2012. Did any notable Dutch writers die that year? Maybe someone like Jan Kees van den Berg? No. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to someone like W.F. Hermans, but as mentioned before, he died in 1995. 

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates? Or perhaps I'm missing someone. Let me think again. The key is Dutch, writer, translator, born 1937, died 2012. 

Wait, I just found a name: someone like Jan van der Vegt? No, not sure. 

Wait, maybe it's someone like the translator of Harry Potter? But that's a different context. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to someone like the author of "The House of Children," which is by Harry Mulisch. But again, his dates don't fit. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone like the Dutch writer who wrote "The Discovery of Heaven," which is by Harry Mulisch. But again, he died in 2010. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to someone like the Dutch writer who was a Nobel laureate? But the Nobel Prize in Literature for the Netherlands was awarded to someone like P.C. Hooft, but that's in the 17th century. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone like the author of "The Assault," which is by Harry Mulisch. But again, his death year is 2010. 

Hmm. Maybe I need to check if there's a Dutch writer who died in 2012. Let me think. Oh! I think it's someone like the Dutch writer and translator, someone like the author of "The Vanishing," which is a novel by George Simenon, but that's a French author. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to someone like the Dutch writer who translated works by other authors. Let me think. Maybe someone like the translator of the works of Kafka into Dutch? Not sure. 

Wait, I'm not getting it. Let me try to think of the years again. 1937 to 2012. So, 75 years old. Let me think of Dutch writers born in the 1930s. 

Wait, there's someone like the Dutch writer and poet, someone like the author of "The Embarrassment," which is by W.F. Hermans. But again, he died in 1995. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone like the Dutch writer who was a contemporary of Harry Mulisch.

Wait, I think I need to look up a list of Dutch writers and their birth and death years. But since I can't access external information, I have to rely on my memory. 

Wait, another thought: the Dutch writer and translator born in 1937, died 2012. Let me think of the name. Maybe it's someone like the author of "The Discovery of Heaven," which is Harry Mulisch, but again, his death year is 2010.
