Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1214, died in 1270, and known as the King of France. Hmm, I need to recall French monarchs from that time period.

First, the years: 1214 to 1270. Let me think about the Capetian dynasty. Louis VIII was king from 1223 to 1226, but he was born in 1187. Then Louis IX, also known as Saint Louis, was his son. Louis IX reigned from 1226 until his death in 1270. Wait, his birth year... I think he was born in 1214. Yes, that fits. He's a well-known king of France, and he's canonized as a saint. He's famous for leading the Seventh and Eighth Crusades. So the answer should be Louis IX of France, also called Saint Louis. Let me double-check the dates. Born 1214, died 1270 during the Eighth Crusade in Tunis. Yep, that's correct. I don't think there's another French king with those exact dates. Maybe check if there's any confusion with other monarchs, but I'm pretty confident it's Louis IX.
