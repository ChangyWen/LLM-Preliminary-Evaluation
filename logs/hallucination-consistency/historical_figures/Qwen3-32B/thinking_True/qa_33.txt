Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1840 and died in 1902, known as a French writer. Hmm. First, I need to think of notable French writers from that time period.

1840 to 1902... So the person would have been active in the late 19th century. Let me list some French writers from that era. There's Émile Zola, who was a major figure in the naturalist movement. He was born in 1840, right? Wait, let me check the dates. Émile Zola was born on April 2, 1840, and he died on September 29, 1902. That fits perfectly with the years given. 

Other possibilities might include someone like Jules Verne, but he was born in 1828 and died in 1905, so the dates don't match. Victor Hugo was born in 1802 and died in 1885, so that's too early. Stéphane Mallarmé was born in 1842 and died in 1898, so close but not the exact years. 

Zola's death in 1902 was due to being shot by a anti-Dreyfusard, which was a significant event. His works include "Les Misérables" no, wait, that's Victor Hugo. Zola wrote "Thérèse Raquin," "Nana," and "J'accuse...!" which was the open letter about the Dreyfus Affair. 

So putting it all together, the answer is likely Émile Zola. Let me just confirm the birth and death years again. Yes, 1840-1902. That matches exactly. I think that's the correct answer.
