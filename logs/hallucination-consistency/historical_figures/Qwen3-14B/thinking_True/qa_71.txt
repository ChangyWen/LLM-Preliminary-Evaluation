Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in -384 and died in -322, known as an ancient Greek philosopher. Hmm, I need to recall the major philosophers from ancient Greece.

First, the dates: -384 to -322. Let me think. Aristotle was a big name. Wait, when was he born? I think he was born in 384 BCE, so that would be -384. And he died in 322 BCE, which is -322. That matches the dates given. But wait, let me confirm. Aristotle was a student of Plato and a teacher of Alexander the Great. Yes, that's right. His dates are commonly cited as 384â€“322 BCE. So the answer should be Aristotle. Let me check if there's any other philosopher with those dates. Socrates was earlier, born around 470 BCE. Plato was born in 428 BCE. So no, Aristotle is the one who fits those dates. I think that's correct.
