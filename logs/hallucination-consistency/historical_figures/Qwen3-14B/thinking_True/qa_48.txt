Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1775 and died in 1836, known as a French physicist and mathematician. Hmm. First, I need to think of notable French scientists from that time period.

I remember that the 19th century had several prominent French scientists. Let me think about the dates. Born in 1775, so that would be someone who was active during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The person died in 1836, so their career would have spanned the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era.

One name that comes to mind is André-Marie Ampère. Wait, he was a French physicist and mathematician. Let me check his dates. Ampère was born in 1775 and died in 1836. Yes, that matches. He's known for his work in electromagnetism, and the unit of electric current, the ampere, is named after him. That seems to fit the description. 

I should make sure there aren't any other French physicists from that time with similar birth and death years. Another possibility might be someone like Joseph Fourier, but he was born in 1768 and died in 1830. So that doesn't fit. Maybe someone else? Let me think. Pierre-Simon Laplace was born in 1749 and died in 1827. No. Antoine Lavoisier was born in 1743 and died in 1794. Not matching. 

So, going back, André-Marie Ampère is the one who fits the birth and death years and the fields of physics and mathematics. I think that's the answer.
