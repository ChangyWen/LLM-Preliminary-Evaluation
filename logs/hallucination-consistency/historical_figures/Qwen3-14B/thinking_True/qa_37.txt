Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1802 and died in 1885, known as a French poet, novelist, and dramatist. Hmm. First, I need to think of French writers from that time period. The 19th century, so maybe someone from the Romantic era?

Victor Hugo comes to mind. He was a major figure in French literature. Let me check his dates. He was born in 1802 and died in 1885. Yes, that matches. He wrote "Les Mis√©rables" and "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame," which are novels. He was also a poet and a dramatist. His plays include "Ruy Blas" and "Cromwell." So that seems to fit all the criteria. I don't think there's another prominent French writer with those exact dates. Maybe someone else? Let me think. Alexandre Dumas was born in 1824, so too late. Alfred de Musset was born in 1810. So Hugo is the one. Yeah, I'm pretty confident it's Victor Hugo.
