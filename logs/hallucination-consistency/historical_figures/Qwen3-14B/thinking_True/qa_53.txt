Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1639 and died in 1699, known as a French dramatist. Hmm, I need to recall French playwrights from that era.

First, the dates: 1639 to 1699. That's the 17th century. The French playwrights of that time... Molière comes to mind. Wait, when was he born and died? Let me think. Molière was born in 1622 and died in 1673. No, that's not matching the dates given here. The user's dates are 1639-1699. So maybe someone else?

Another possibility: Jean Racine? He was born in 1639. Yes! Jean Racine was born in 1639. And he died in 1699. Let me confirm that. Yes, Jean Racine was a French dramatist, known for works like "Phèdre" and "Andromaque." He was a contemporary of Molière but a bit younger. His lifespan fits exactly with the dates provided. So the answer should be Jean Racine.
