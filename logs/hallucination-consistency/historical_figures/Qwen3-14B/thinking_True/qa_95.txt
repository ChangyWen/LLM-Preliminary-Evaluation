Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1896 and died in 1940, known as the 'Italian Marshal of the Air Force and minister'. Hmm. First, I need to recall Italian military figures from that era.

The time period is between 1896 and 1940. The person was a Marshal of the Air Force, which is a high rank in the air force. Also, they were a minister, so maybe a minister of defense or something similar. Let me think about Italian military leaders during World War II.

Wait, the person died in 1940, so they were active before the war. The Italian Air Force was established in 1923, so maybe someone who rose through the ranks. The name that comes to mind is Italo Balbo. He was an Italian general and politician. Let me check his dates. Balbo was born in 1896 and died in 1940. Yes, that matches. He was a Marshal of the Air Force and served as the Minister of Aeronautics. He was also known for leading the transatlantic flight to the United States in 1933. That seems to fit the description. I think that's the person they're looking for.
