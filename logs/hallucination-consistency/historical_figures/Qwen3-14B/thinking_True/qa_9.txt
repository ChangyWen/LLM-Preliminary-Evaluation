Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1599 and died in 1660, known as a Spanish painter. Hmm, I need to recall Spanish painters from that time period.

First, I know that the Spanish Golden Age was around the 16th to 17th centuries. Some famous painters from that era include Velázquez, Goya, but wait, Goya was later, in the late 18th century. Velázquez was born in 1599, right? Let me check. Yes, Diego Velázquez was born in 1599 and died in 1660. He was a court painter for King Philip IV of Spain. His works include "Las Meninas" and "The Surrender of Breda." That fits the description. I think that's the one. Let me make sure there's no other painter from that exact time. Maybe someone else? I don't recall another Spanish painter with those exact dates. So the answer should be Diego Velázquez.
