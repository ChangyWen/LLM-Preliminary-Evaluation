Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1821 and died in 1867, known as a French poet, essayist, and art critic. Hmm. First, I need to recall French literary figures from that time period.

I know that Charles Baudelaire comes to mind. He was a French poet and essayist. Let me check his dates. Baudelaire was born in 1821 and died in 1867. Yes, that matches. He's famous for works like "Les Fleurs du mal" and his critical essays on art and literature. Also, he was an art critic, which fits the description. I think that's the one. Let me make sure there aren't others. Maybe Th√©ophile Gautier? But he was born in 1811 and died in 1872. No, not matching. Another possibility could be someone else, but Baudelaire seems to fit perfectly. I'll go with Charles Baudelaire.
