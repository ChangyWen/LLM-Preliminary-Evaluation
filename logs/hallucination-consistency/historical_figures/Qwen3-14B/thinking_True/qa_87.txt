Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1920, died in 2005, and known as the 264th pope of the Catholic Church.

First, I need to recall the popes who were born in the 20th century. The 264th pope... Let me think. The papacy has a long list, so maybe I should check the timeline. The 264th pope would be someone who served in the 20th or 21st century. Let me think about the popes in that era.

John Paul II was a significant pope. He was born in 1920, right? Yes, Karol Józef Wojtyła was born in 1920 in Poland. He became pope in 1978, which would make him the 264th pope. He died in 2005. That fits all the criteria: born 1920, died 2005, 264th pope. I think that's the one. Let me confirm the numbers. The papal numbering can be tricky, but John Paul II is indeed recognized as the 264th pope. So the answer should be John Paul II.
