Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1899, died in 1943, known as a French resistance fighter and civil servant. Hmm.

First, I need to think of French people from that time period. The French Resistance was active during World War II, so the person would have been active around that time. Born in 1899, so they would have been in their 40s during the war. Died in 1943, so they were killed during the war.

Civil servant... Maybe someone who worked in the government before the war. Let me think. Jean Moulin comes to mind. He was a key figure in the French Resistance. He was born in 1899 and died in 1943. He was a civil servant before the war, worked in the Ministry of Finance, and then became involved in the Resistance. He was captured by the Gestapo and died in custody. That fits the description. Let me double-check the dates. Yes, Jean Moulin was born on March 22, 1899, and died on July 8, 1943. He was indeed a civil servant and a prominent leader in the French Resistance. I think that's the one.
