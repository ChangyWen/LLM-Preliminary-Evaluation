Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1642 and died in 1727, known as a British physicist and mathematician. Hmm, I need to recall who fits those dates and fields.

First, the dates: 1642 to 1727. That's a span of 85 years. I remember that Isaac Newton was a prominent scientist from that era. Let me check his dates. Yes, Isaac Newton was born on December 25, 1642, and died on March 31, 1727. He was definitely a British physicist and mathematician. He's famous for his laws of motion, universal gravitation, and contributions to calculus. 

Wait, could there be another person with similar dates? Let me think. Maybe someone else in the same period? For example, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was a mathematician and philosopher, but he was born in 1646 and died in 1716, so not matching the dates. Then there's Robert Hooke, but he was born in 1635 and died in 1703. Not matching. 

Another possibility: Edmond Halley? He was born in 1656 and died in 1742. No, dates don't match. So, the only one that comes to mind is Isaac Newton. His birth and death years align perfectly with the question. Also, he's renowned for his work in physics and mathematics, so that fits the description. I think that's the answer.
