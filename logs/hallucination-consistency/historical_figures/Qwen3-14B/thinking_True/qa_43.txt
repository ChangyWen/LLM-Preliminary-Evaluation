Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1524 and died in 1580, known as a Portuguese poet. Hmm, I need to recall Portuguese poets from that era.

First, I know that the 16th century was a significant time for Portuguese literature. The most famous Portuguese poet from that period is Luís de Camões. Let me check his dates. Camões was born in 1524 and died in 1580. That matches the dates given. He's best known for his epic poem "Os Lusíadas," which celebrates the Portuguese explorations, especially Vasco da Gama's voyage to India. 

Wait, are there any other poets from that time? Maybe someone else? I don't think so. The name that comes to mind immediately is Camões. Let me confirm the dates again. Yes, he was born in 1524 and died in 1580. So the answer should be Luís de Camões.
