Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1899 and died in 1986, known as an Argentine short story writer, essayist, poet, and translator. Hmm.

First, I need to think of prominent Argentine writers from that time period. The most famous one that comes to mind is Jorge Luis Borges. Wait, when was he born and died? Let me check. Borges was born in 1899 and died in 1986. Yes, that matches the dates given. He was indeed a short story writer, essayist, poet, and translator. His works like "Ficciones" and "The Aleph" are well-known. Also, he translated works from other languages, including English and French. 

I should make sure there aren't any other Argentine writers with the same birth and death years. Maybe someone like Julio Cortázar? No, Cortázar was born in 1926 and died in 1984. So that doesn't fit. Another possibility could be Adolfo Bioy Casares, but he was born in 1914 and died in 1999. So no. 

Borges definitely fits the criteria. His contributions to literature, especially in the realm of short stories and essays, are significant. He's often associated with magical realism and has a unique style. Also, his translations of works by authors like Walt Whitman and others are part of his legacy. 

I think that's the one. The answer should be Jorge Luis Borges.
