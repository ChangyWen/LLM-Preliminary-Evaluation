Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1940, died in 1996, known as a 'Russian-American poet'. Hmm. First, I need to think of poets from that time frame who fit that description.

I know that Joseph Brodsky comes to mind. He was a Russian poet who later became an American citizen. Let me check his dates. He was born in 1940, right? Yes, he was born in Leningrad, which is now St. Petersburg, Russia. He died in 1996. And he was indeed a prominent Russian-American poet. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1987. That seems to fit all the criteria. I don't think there are many other poets from that era with that exact background. Let me just make sure there's no one else. Maybe someone like Vladimir Nabokov? No, he was born in 1899 and died in 1977. So that's not it. Another possibility could be someone like Czesław Miłosz, but he was Polish, not Russian-American. So I think Brodsky is the correct answer here.
