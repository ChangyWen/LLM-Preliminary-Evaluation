Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1790, died in 1832, known as a 'French classical scholar'. Hmm. First, I need to think of people from that time period who were French and worked in classical studies.

Wait, the term 'French classical scholar' might be a bit tricky. Maybe they're referring to someone who studied classical antiquity, like ancient Greece or Rome. Let me think of French scholars from the early 19th century. 

I remember that the 19th century had a lot of classical scholars. Let me check the dates. Born in 1790, died in 1832. That would make them around 42 years old. Let me think of names. 

Oh, maybe someone like Fran√ßois Guizot? Wait, he was born in 1787 and died in 1874. No, that's not matching. What about someone else? 

Wait, there's a name that comes to mind: Jean-Baptiste Bury. No, I think he was born later. Let me think again. 

Wait, the user might be referring to someone who was a classical scholar in the sense of studying ancient texts. Maybe a philologist or historian. 

Another thought: the French Revolution was in 1789, so someone born in 1790 would be a child during that time. Maybe they were part of the post-revolutionary generation. 

Wait, I recall that the French scholar who was involved in the study of ancient texts and was born in 1790... Oh! Maybe it's someone like Adolphe Pictet? No, he was born in 1779. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to someone who was a classical scholar in the sense of being a scholar of the classical period, like the ancient Greeks and Romans. Let me check some databases in my mind.

Wait, I'm not getting this. Let me think of the dates again. 1790 to 1832. Let me check if there's a famous French person from that time. 

Oh! Wait, maybe it's someone like the philosopher Auguste Comte? No, he was born in 1798. 

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to a person who was a classical scholar in the sense of being a scholar of the classical languages, like Latin and Greek. Maybe someone like the philologist? 

Wait, I think I'm missing something. Let me try to think of the name. Maybe it's someone like the French historian and archaeologist? 

Wait, I think I've heard of a person named Jean-Baptiste Lamy, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to someone who was a classical scholar in the sense of being a scholar of the classical period, like the ancient world. 

Wait, I think I need to check if there's a well-known figure with those dates. Let me think of the years again. 1790 to 1832.
