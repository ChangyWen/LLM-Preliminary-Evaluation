Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1921, died in 1981, known as a French singer-songwriter and poet. Hmm. First, I need to think of French artists from that era. Let me start with the time frame. 1921 to 1981, so they were active during the mid-20th century.

Singer-songwriters and poets... Maybe someone like Jacques Brel? Wait, when was he born? Let me recall. Jacques Brel was born in 1929, so that's not 1921. What about someone else? Maybe Edith Piaf? She was born in 1915, so that's too early. She died in 1963, so not matching the death year.

Another thought: Léo Ferré. He was a French singer-songwriter and poet. Let me check his dates. Léo Ferré was born in 1916, so that's not 1921. Died in 1991, so that's not matching either.

Wait, what about someone like Michel Legrand? No, he was born in 1932. Hmm. Maybe someone from the 1920s? Let me think. Oh, maybe someone like Georges Brassens? He was born in 1921. Let me confirm. Yes, Georges Brassens was born on April 19, 1921, and died on October 29, 1981. He was a French singer-songwriter and poet, known for his chansons. That fits the criteria exactly. I think that's the one.
