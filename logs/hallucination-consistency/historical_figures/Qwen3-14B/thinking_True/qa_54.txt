Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1606 and died in 1684, known as a French tragedian. Hmm, French tragedian... I remember that the French playwrights from that era include people like Racine and Corneille. Let me check their dates.

Racine was born in 1639, so that's too late. Corneille was born in 1606. Wait, that matches the birth year. Let me confirm his death date. Pierre Corneille died in 1684. Yes, that fits. He's known for tragedies like "Le Cid." So the answer should be Pierre Corneille. I think that's right. Let me double-check to make sure there's no other French tragedian with those dates. I don't recall another one. Yeah, Corneille is the one.
