Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1867 and died in 1935, known as a Polish politician, First Marshall, and Prime Minister during that time.

First, I need to recall Polish political figures from that era. The time period is late 19th to early 20th century. The First Marshall of Poland... Wait, the title might be "First Marshal" or "First Marshall." In Polish, it's "Pierwszy Marszałek." I think the person they're referring to is Józef Piłsudski. He was a significant figure in Polish history, involved in the independence movement, and held high offices.

Let me check the dates. Piłsudski was born in 1867 and died in 1935. Yes, that matches. He was the Chief of State (First Marshal) of the Second Polish Republic and served as Prime Minister. He played a key role in Poland's independence after World War I. 

I should make sure there aren't other politicians with similar roles and dates. Another name that comes to mind is Ignacy Jan Paderewski, but he was a pianist and politician, born in 1860 and died in 1941. Not matching the dates. So Piłsudski is the most likely answer. I think that's correct.
