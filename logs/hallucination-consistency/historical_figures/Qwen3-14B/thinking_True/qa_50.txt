Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1622 and died in 1673, known as a French playwright and actor. Hmm, I need to think of French playwrights from that time period.

First, I remember that Molière is a famous French playwright. Let me check his dates. Molière was born in 1622, right? And he died in 1673. Yes, that matches the dates given. He was also an actor, so that fits the description. Let me confirm. Molière, whose real name was Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, was indeed a playwright and actor. He's known for works like "Tartuffe" and "The Miser." His death date is 1673, so that's correct. I think that's the one. I don't recall any other French playwrights from that exact time frame with those dates. So the answer should be Molière.
