Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1888 and died in 1946, known as a Chilean politician and President during that time. First, I need to recall Chilean presidents from that era.

I know that Salvador Allende was a Chilean president, but he was born in 1908 and died in 1973, so that's not matching. Maybe someone earlier. Let me think. The president who was in office around the 1930s and 1940s... Oh, Arturo Alessandri Palma. Wait, he was president twice, first in the 1920s and then again in the 1930s. But his death date might be different. Let me check. Arturo Alessandri was born in 1888 and died in 1946. Yes, that fits. He served as President of Chile from 1920 to 1924 and then again from 1932 to 1938. So he was a Chilean politician and president during that time frame. The user's query mentions the years 1888-1946, which are his birth and death years. So the answer should be Arturo Alessandri Palma.
