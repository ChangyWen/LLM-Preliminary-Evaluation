Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1683 and died in 1764, known as a French Baroque composer and music theorist. Hmm, I need to recall composers from that era.

First, the Baroque period in France... I know that Jean-Baptiste Lully was a significant figure, but he died in 1687, so that's too early. Then there's Fran√ßois Couperin, who was a French composer. Let me check his dates. Couperin was born in 1668 and died in 1733. Not matching the years given here.

Wait, the user mentioned 1683 to 1764. Let me think. Another possibility is Jean-Philippe Rameau. He was born in 1683 and died in 1764. Yes, that fits the dates. Rameau was a French composer and music theorist, known for his work in the Baroque period. He wrote treatises on harmony and composed operas. That seems to match the description. Let me confirm the dates again. Yes, Rameau was born in 1683 and died in 1764. So the answer should be Jean-Philippe Rameau.
