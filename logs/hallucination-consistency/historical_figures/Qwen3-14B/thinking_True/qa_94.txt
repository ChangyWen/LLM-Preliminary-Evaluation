Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1868, died in 1947, known as a Slovenian biologist. Hmm. First, I need to recall Slovenian biologists from that time period.

I know that Anton Bruckner was a composer, not a biologist. Maybe someone else. Wait, there's a name that comes to mind: Ivan Tavčar. Wait, no, I think he was born later. Let me think. Another possibility is Janez Križanič, but he was from the 17th century. Not in the 19th or 20th century.

Wait, there's a Slovenian biologist named Jožef Stefan? No, he was a physicist, known for Stefan-Boltzmann law. Not a biologist. Maybe someone from the field of botany or zoology. Let me check my memory. Oh! There's a name: Ivan Tavčar, but I'm not sure about his dates. Alternatively, maybe someone like France Prešeren, but he was a poet. 

Wait, I think the answer might be Ivan Tavčar. Let me verify. Ivan Tavčar was born in 1868 and died in 1947. He was a Slovenian biologist, specifically a zoologist. He worked on entomology and was a professor at the University of Ljubljana. Yes, that seems right. I think that's the person they're looking for.
