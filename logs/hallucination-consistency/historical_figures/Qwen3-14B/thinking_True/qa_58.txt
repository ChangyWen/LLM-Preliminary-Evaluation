Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1842 and died in 1898, known as a French Symbolist poet. Hmm, I need to recall French poets from that era.

First, the dates: 1842 to 1898. That's the 19th century. The Symbolist movement in France was prominent in the late 19th century, so that fits. Key figures in French Symbolism include Stéphane Mallarmé, Paul Verlaine, and Arthur Rimbaud. Let me check their birth and death years.

Stéphane Mallarmé was born in 1842. Let me confirm that. Yes, he was born on March 18, 1842, and died on September 9, 1898. That matches the dates given. He's definitely a major figure in French Symbolism. Paul Verlaine was born in 1844, so that's a bit later. Arthur Rimbaud was born in 1854, so also not 1842. 

Another possibility might be Charles Baudelaire, but he died in 1867, so that's too early. So the answer should be Stéphane Mallarmé. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure there's no other poet from that exact timeframe. I don't recall any others fitting those exact birth and death years. Yeah, Mallarmé seems right.
