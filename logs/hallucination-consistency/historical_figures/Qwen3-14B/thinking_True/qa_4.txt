Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1756, died in 1791, and known as an Austrian composer of the Classical period. Hmm, I need to think about composers from that era.

First, the time frame: 1756 to 1791. That's the late 18th century. The Classical period in music is usually considered to be from around the mid-18th century to the early 19th century, so that fits. Now, Austrian composers... The most famous one from that time is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Let me check his dates. Mozart was born in 1756 and died in 1791. Yes, that matches exactly. He was an Austrian composer, and he's definitely associated with the Classical period. Other composers like Haydn were also Austrian, but Haydn was born in 1732 and died in 1809, so the dates don't fit. Beethoven was born later, in 1770. So Mozart is the one here. I think that's the answer.
