Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1713 and died in 1784, known as a French Enlightenment philosopher and encyclopædist. Hmm, the key terms here are French Enlightenment, philosopher, encyclopædist, and the dates 1713-1784.

First, I need to recall who the major figures of the French Enlightenment were. The Encyclopédie comes to mind, which was a major project during that time. The main people involved in that were Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. But wait, when were they born and died?

Denis Diderot was born in 1713. Let me check that. Yes, he was born on July 5, 1713, and died on July 30, 1784. That matches the dates given. He was a key figure in the Enlightenment, known for his work on the Encyclopédie, which aimed to compile and disseminate knowledge. He was also a philosopher, writer, and critic. 

Jean le Rond d'Alembert was another collaborator on the Encyclopédie, but he was born in 1717 and died in 1783, so the dates don't match. So the answer is likely Denis Diderot. Let me confirm the dates again. Yes, Diderot's birth and death years fit exactly. He's known for being a central figure in the Enlightenment, and the Encyclopédie was his major work. I think that's the one.
