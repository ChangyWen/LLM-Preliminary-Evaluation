Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in -470 and died in -399, known as an ancient Greek philosopher. Hmm, I need to recall the major philosophers from that time period.

First, the dates: -470 to -399. That's around the 5th century BCE. Let me think. Socrates was a prominent philosopher, but when was he born and died? I think Socrates was born in 469 BCE and died in 399 BCE. Wait, that's very close to the dates given here. The user has -470, which would be 470 BCE, and -399 is 399 BCE. So Socrates was born in 469, which is one year later than -470. But maybe the dates are approximate or there's a slight discrepancy in the way they're presented. Also, Socrates is known for being a key figure in ancient Greek philosophy, even though he didn't write any works himself. His student was Plato, and then Aristotle. 

Another possibility: Maybe the user is thinking of someone else. Let me check other philosophers. Plato was born in 428/427 BCE, so that's later. Aristotle was born in 384 BCE. So those are later dates. So the only one that fits the time frame is Socrates. Even though the birth year is 469 BCE instead of 470, maybe the user rounded it or there's a difference in the calendar system. Also, sometimes dates are given as -470 meaning 470 BCE, so if Socrates was born in 469, that's just one year off. It's possible that the user's numbers are approximate or there's a translation issue. 

I think the answer is Socrates. Let me confirm the dates again. Socrates was born in 469 BCE and died in 399 BCE. The user's dates are -470 (which would be 470 BCE) and -399 (399 BCE). So the birth year is one year earlier, but maybe the user is using a different system or it's a minor discrepancy. Since Socrates is the most well-known philosopher from that period, I think that's the intended answer.
