Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1938, died in 1980, known as a Soviet singer, songwriter, poet, and actor. Hmm. First, I need to recall Soviet artists from that era. Let me think about the timeline. 1938 to 1980, so they were active during the mid-20th century.

Soviet singers... Maybe someone like Vladimir Vysotsky? Wait, he was born in 1938. Let me check his death date. I think he died in 1980. Yes, he was a famous Soviet bard, actor, and poet. He was known for his deep voice and powerful performances. He wrote many songs and was also an actor in films and theater. That fits all the categories: singer, songwriter, poet, actor. Let me confirm the dates again. Born 1938, died 1980. Yes, that's correct. I don't think there's another prominent figure that matches all those criteria. Maybe someone else, but Vysotsky is the one who comes to mind immediately. I think that's the answer.
