Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1807 and died in 1882, known as an Italian general, patriot, and republican. Hmm. I need to think of Italian figures from that time period.

First, the dates: 1807 to 1882. That's a span of 75 years. The person was active during the 19th century, which was a time of unification for Italy, known as the Risorgimento. So maybe someone involved in that movement.

Giuseppe Garibaldi comes to mind. He was a key figure in the unification of Italy. Let me check his dates. Garibaldi was born in 1807 and died in 1882. Yes, that matches. He was a general, a patriot, and a republican. He led the Expedition of the Thousand, which helped unify the Italian states. His nickname was "The Red Shirt" because of the red shirts his volunteers wore. 

Wait, are there any other possibilities? Maybe someone else? Let me think. Mazzini was another important figure, but he was born in 1805 and died in 1872. So not matching the dates. Cavour was born in 1810, so too late. So Garibaldi seems to fit perfectly. I think that's the answer.
