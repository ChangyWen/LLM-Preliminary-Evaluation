Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1844, died in 1896, known as a French poet. Hmm. First, I need to think of French poets from that time period. Let me recall some names.

Paul Verlaine comes to mind. He was a French poet associated with the Symbolist movement. When was he born and died? Let me check my memory. I think he was born in the mid-19th century. Wait, 1844? Let me confirm. Yes, Paul Verlaine was born on March 30, 1844, and he died on January 27, 1896. That matches the dates given. He's known for his poetry, collaborations with Arthur Rimbaud, and his role in the Symbolist movement. Another possibility might be Charles Baudelaire, but he died earlier, in 1867. So Verlaine fits the dates. I think that's the answer.
