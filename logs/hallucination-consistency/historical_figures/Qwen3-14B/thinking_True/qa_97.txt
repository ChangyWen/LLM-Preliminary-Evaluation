Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1265 and died in 1321, known as an Italian poet. Hmm, I need to think about Italian poets from that time period.

First, I remember that Dante Alighieri is a major figure from the late Middle Ages. He was an Italian poet, right? Let me check the dates. Dante was born in 1265 and died in 1321. That matches the years given. He's famous for "The Divine Comedy," which is a significant work in Italian literature. 

Wait, are there any other poets from that era? Maybe Petrarch? But Petrarch was born in 1304, so that's later. Boccaccio was born in 1313, also after 1321. So Dante is the one who fits the birth and death years. Also, he's often referred to as the father of the Italian language, which adds to his prominence. 

I think that's the answer. The user might be looking for Dante Alighieri. Let me confirm once more. Yes, Dante was born in Florence, Italy, in 1265 and died in 1321. His most famous work is "The Divine Comedy," written in the early 14th century. Definitely, the answer is Dante Alighieri.
