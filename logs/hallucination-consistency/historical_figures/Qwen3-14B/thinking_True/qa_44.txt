Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1473 and died in 1543. They mentioned he was a Renaissance-era mathematician, astronomer, and clergyman known for the heliocentric model of the Universe.

First, I need to recall who proposed the heliocentric model. The most famous person associated with that is Nicolaus Copernicus. Let me check the dates. Copernicus was born in 1473 and died in 1543. That matches the dates given. He was a Polish astronomer and mathematician, and he was also a clergyman, as he was a canon in the Catholic Church. His work "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium" introduced the heliocentric theory, which placed the Sun at the center of the universe. 

I don't think there are other prominent figures from that time with those exact dates and contributions. Galileo came later, in the 16th and 17th centuries, so he's not the one. Kepler and Newton were even later. So yes, the answer should be Nicolaus Copernicus.
