Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1700 and died in 1755, known as a German-born French soldier and statesman. Hmm. First, I need to think of people from that time period who fit that description.

I remember that the 18th century had a lot of European military leaders. The French and Prussian armies were prominent. Wait, there's a name that comes to mind: Maurice de Saxe. Let me check the dates. He was born in 1700, right? And died in 1750, wait, no, the user said 1755. Maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me think again.

Another possibility is someone like Frederick the Great, but he was born in 1712, so that's not matching. What about someone from the French court? Maybe a military leader who was German-born but served France. Oh, Maurice de Saxe was actually born in Germany, in what is now Poland, but he was a French military commander. He died in 1750, though. The user says 1755. Maybe there's another person.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the death year? Or perhaps I'm forgetting someone else. Let me think. There's also the possibility of someone like the Duke of Richelieu, but he was born in 1696. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to someone else. Wait, I think I might have confused the dates. Maurice de Saxe was born in 1700 and died in 1750. The user says 1755. Maybe the user is incorrect, but the question is about the person known as German-born French soldier and statesman. Maurice de Saxe is the most prominent one I can think of. Maybe the death year is a typo. Alternatively, could it be someone else?

Wait, another angle: statesman as well as soldier. Maurice de Saxe was a military leader, but was he a statesman? Maybe not as much. Alternatively, someone like the Marquis de Condorcet, but he was born later. Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone else. Let me check my memory again. I think Maurice de Saxe is the best fit here, even if the death year is slightly off. Maybe the user has a different source. Alternatively, perhaps the death year is correct, and I'm missing someone else. Let me think of other German-born French figures. There's also the possibility of someone like the Duke of Choiseul, but he was born in 1719. Hmm. I think I'll go with Maurice de Saxe, even if the death year might be a bit off, as he's the most fitting answer.
