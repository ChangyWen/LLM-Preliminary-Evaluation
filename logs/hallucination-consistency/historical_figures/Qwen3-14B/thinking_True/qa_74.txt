Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1892 and died in 1973, known as a British philologist and author of classic high fantasy works.

First, I need to recall who fits these criteria. The key points here are the birth and death years, being British, a philologist, and author of high fantasy. High fantasy authors... J.R.R. Tolkien comes to mind immediately. He wrote "The Lord of the Rings" and other works. Let me check the dates. Tolkien was born in 1892 and died in 1973. Yes, that matches. He was also a philologist, working on languages and linguistics, which is part of his academic background. So that must be the answer. I don't think there's another author who fits all these details. Maybe C.S. Lewis? But he was born in 1898 and died in 1963. So no. Definitely Tolkien.
