Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1879 and died in 1941, known as a Chilean politician and president. First, I need to recall Chilean presidents from that era.

I know that Salvador Allende was a Chilean president, but he was born in 1908 and died in 1973, so that's not matching. Maybe someone earlier. Let me think. The president who was in office around the early 20th century... Oh, Arturo Alessandri Palma. Wait, when was he president? He served two non-consecutive terms: first from 1920 to 1924, then from 1932 to 1938. He was born in 1879 and died in 1941. That fits the dates given. Let me confirm the dates again. Yes, Arturo Alessandri was born on April 12, 1879, and died on April 13, 1941. He was a Chilean politician and president. That must be the person the user is asking about.
