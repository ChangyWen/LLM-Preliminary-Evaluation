Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1785 and died in 1873, known as an Italian poet and novelist. Hmm, I need to think of Italian writers from that time period.

First, the dates: 1785 to 1873. That's a long career span. Let me think about famous Italian authors. Alessandro Manzoni comes to mind. He was a novelist and poet. Wait, when was he born? Let me recall. I think he was born in the early 19th century, maybe around 1785? Let me check my memory. Yes, Alessandro Manzoni was born on March 7, 1785, and died on May 22, 1873. He's best known for his novel "The Betrothed" (I Promessi Sposi), which is a classic of Italian literature. He was also involved in the Risorgimento, the movement for Italian unification. So that fits the description: Italian poet and novelist, born and died in those years. I don't think there's another major figure that matches. Maybe someone else? Let me think. Giuseppe Parini? No, he died earlier. Ugo Foscolo? He was born in 1778 and died in 1827. So no. Leopardi? He was born in 1798. So Manzoni is the one. Yeah, I'm pretty confident that's the answer.
