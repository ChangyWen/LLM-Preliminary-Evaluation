Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1868, died in 1950, known as a Chilean politician and president. Hmm.

First, I need to recall Chilean presidents from that era. Let me think. The 20th century... The president who comes to mind is Salvador Allende. Wait, but when was he born? I think he was born in the early 20th century. Let me check my memory. No, Allende was born in 1908, so that's not matching the 1868 birth year.

Wait, maybe it's someone earlier. Let me think. The 19th century to early 20th century. Maybe Arturo Alessandri? He was a Chilean president. Let me check his dates. Arturo Alessandri Palma was born in 1868. Yes, that's the birth year. He served as president of Chile, first in 1920-1924, then again in 1932-1938. He died in 1950. That fits the criteria: born 1868, died 1950, Chilean president. I think that's the one. Let me confirm. Yes, Arturo Alessandri was a prominent Chilean politician and president. So the answer should be Arturo Alessandri.
