Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1908 and died in 1991, known as an American physicist and engineer. Hmm. First, I need to think of notable American physicists from that time frame.

1908 to 1991... So the person would be around 83 years old when they died. Let me think. Some famous physicists born in the early 20th century... Maybe someone like Richard Feynman? Wait, Feynman was born in 1918, so that's not it. What about Edward Teller? He was born in 1908. Let me check his death date. I think he died in 2003, so that's not matching. 

Wait, another name... Maybe someone involved in the Manhattan Project? Or perhaps a Nobel laureate? Let me think. There's also Robert Oppenheimer, but he was born in 1904 and died in 1967. Not matching the dates. 

Wait, the user mentioned engineer as well. Maybe someone who worked on radar or something during WWII? Let me think. There's also Vannevar Bush, but he was born in 1890 and died in 1974. Not matching. 

Wait, another thought: John Bardeen. He was a physicist and engineer, won the Nobel Prize twice. Let me check his dates. He was born in 1908 and died in 1991. Yes! That fits. John Bardeen was an American physicist and electrical engineer, known for his work on the transistor and superconductivity. He was born in 1908 and died in 1991. That must be the person the user is asking about.
