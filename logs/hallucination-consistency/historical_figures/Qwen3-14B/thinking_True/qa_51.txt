Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1564 and died in 1616, known as an English playwright and poet. Hmm, I need to think about who that could be.

First, the dates: 1564 to 1616. That's a span of 52 years. Let me recall some famous people from that era. Shakespeare comes to mind. William Shakespeare was an English playwright and poet. Let me check the dates. Yes, he was born in 1564 and died in 1616. That matches exactly. I don't think there's another major figure from that time with those exact dates. Maybe someone else, but I can't think of any other prominent English playwrights from that period. So the answer should be William Shakespeare.
