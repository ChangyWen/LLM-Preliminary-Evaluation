Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1840, died in 1902, known as a French writer. Hmm. First, I need to think of French writers from that time period. Let me start by recalling some famous French authors.

Victor Hugo comes to mind, but he was born in 1802 and died in 1885, so that's not matching the dates. Then there's Émile Zola. Wait, Zola was born in 1840. Let me check his death date. I think he died in 1902. Yes, that's right. He was a prominent French writer, part of the Naturalist movement. His works include "J'accuse..." and novels like "Germinal." That fits the criteria. Another possibility might be someone else, but I can't think of another French writer with those exact birth and death years. Let me double-check. Zola was born on April 2, 1840, and died on September 28, 1902. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be Émile Zola.
