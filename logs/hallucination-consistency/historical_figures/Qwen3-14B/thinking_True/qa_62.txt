Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1360 and died in 1428, known as a medieval Russian artist. Hmm, I need to recall Russian medieval artists from that time period.

First, I know that medieval Russian art includes icons and religious paintings. The most famous names I can think of are Andrei Rublev and Theophanes the Greek. Let me check their dates. Andrei Rublev was born around 1360, right? I think he was active in the 15th century. Wait, he died in 1430, maybe? But the user says died in 1428. Hmm, that's close. Theophanes the Greek was born in 1340, so that's a bit earlier. He died in 1410, so that doesn't fit the 1428 death date.

Wait, maybe there's another artist. Let me think. There's also Dionisius, but I think he was later. Or maybe someone else. Wait, maybe the user is referring to Andrei Rublev. Let me confirm the dates again. Some sources say he was born in 1360 and died in 1430. But the user says 1428. Maybe there's a discrepancy in the dates. Alternatively, could it be another artist? I'm not sure. Theophanes the Greek is another possibility, but his dates don't match. Maybe the user has a specific artist in mind, but I think the closest is Andrei Rublev. Even if the death year is slightly off, he's the most prominent medieval Russian artist from that era. I'll go with Andrei Rublev as the answer.
