Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1821, died in 1881, known as a Russian author. Hmm. First, I need to think of famous Russian authors from that time period. Let me recall.

Leo Tolstoy was a major Russian author. When was he born? I think he was born in 1828, so that's later than 1821. So maybe not him. Then there's Fyodor Dostoevsky. He was born in 1821, right? Let me check that. Yes, Dostoevsky was born in 1821 and died in 1881. He's one of the most famous Russian authors, known for works like "Crime and Punishment" and "The Brothers Karamazov." That fits the birth and death years. Another possibility could be Ivan Turgenev, but he was born in 1818 and died in 1883, so not matching the exact years. Pushkin was earlier, born in 1799. So the answer is likely Fyodor Dostoevsky.
