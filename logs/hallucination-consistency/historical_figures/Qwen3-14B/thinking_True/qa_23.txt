Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1934, died in 1996, known as an American astrophysicist, cosmologist, author, and science educator.

First, I need to recall notable people in those fields with those birth and death years. Let me think. Carl Sagan comes to mind. He was an astrophysicist, cosmologist, author, and science educator. When was he born and died? I think he was born in 1934 and died in 1996. Let me confirm. Yes, Carl Sagan was born on November 9, 1934, and died on December 20, 1996. He's famous for his work on the Voyager Golden Record, the TV series "Cosmos," and his books like "The Demon-Haunted World." That matches all the criteria given. I don't think there's another prominent figure in that field with those exact dates. So the answer should be Carl Sagan.
