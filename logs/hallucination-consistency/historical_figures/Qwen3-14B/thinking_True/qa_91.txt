Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1800 and died in 1849, known as the Slovene national poet and a Carniolan Romantic poet of Slovene descent.

First, I need to recall Slovene literary figures from that time period. The key points here are the birth and death years, the nationality (Slovene), and the association with Romanticism. The term "Carniolan" might refer to the region of Carniola, which is part of present-day Slovenia. 

I remember that France Prešeren is a significant figure in Slovenian literature. He was a poet, and I think he's considered the national poet of Slovenia. Let me check his dates. He was born in 1800 and died in 1849. That matches the years given. Also, he was from Carniola, which is in Slovenia. His most famous work is "Zdravljica," which is the Slovenian national anthem. 

Another possibility might be someone else, but given the dates and the description, Prešeren seems to fit. I don't recall another Slovene poet from that exact time period with those attributes. So I'm pretty confident the answer is France Prešeren.
