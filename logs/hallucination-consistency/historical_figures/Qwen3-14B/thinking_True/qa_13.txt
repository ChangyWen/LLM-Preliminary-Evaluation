Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1918, died in 2016, and known as a Chilean politician and former president. Hmm. First, I need to recall Chilean presidents from that era.

I know that Salvador Allende was a Chilean president, but he was born in 1908 and died in 1973 during the coup. So that's not matching the birth and death years here. Then there's Augusto Pinochet, but he was born in 1915 and died in 2006. Not quite. 

Wait, maybe someone else. Let me think. The user mentioned the person was a former president. Chile has had several presidents. Let me check the timeline. The person was born in 1918, so they would have been around 98 years old when they died in 2016. That's a long lifespan. 

I remember that Patricio Aylwin was president of Chile from 1990 to 1994. He was born in 1918. Let me confirm his death date. Yes, Patricio Aylwin died in 2016. He was a key figure in the transition from Pinochet's dictatorship to democracy. That fits the criteria: born 1918, died 2016, Chilean president. I think that's the one. Let me double-check to make sure there's no other president with those dates. I don't recall another Chilean president with those exact birth and death years. So I'm pretty confident it's Patricio Aylwin.
