Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1854 and died in 1891. They mention a 19th-century French poet who influenced modern literature and arts and prefigured surrealism.

First, I need to think of French poets from that time period. The dates are 1854 to 1891. Let me recall some names. Arthur Rimbaud comes to mind. He was born in 1854 and died in 1891. He was a French poet associated with the Symbolist movement. His work is known for its vivid imagery and unconventional style, which might have influenced surrealism. Surrealism came later, in the early 20th century, so Rimbaud's work could be seen as a precursor. Another name might be Paul Verlaine, but he was born in 1844 and died in 1896, so the dates don't match. Charles Baudelaire was earlier, born in 1821. So Rimbaud fits the birth and death years. Also, his poem "Le Bateau Ivre" (The Drunken Boat) is famous and has surreal elements. Yes, I think Arthur Rimbaud is the answer here.
