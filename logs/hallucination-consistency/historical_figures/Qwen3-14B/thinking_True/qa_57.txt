Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1926 and died in 2016. The description mentions they were an Italian actor, playwright, comedian, singer-songwriter, theater director, painter, and political activist.

First, I need to think of Italian figures from that time period. The years 1926 to 2016... So someone who was active in the mid-20th century. The key here is the multiple roles: actor, playwright, comedian, etc. That's a lot of different fields. Maybe someone who was a multifaceted artist.

Dario Fo comes to mind. He was an Italian actor, playwright, and comedian. He was known for his political activism as well. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1997. Let me check his dates. He was born in 1926 and died in 2016. Yes, that matches. He was also a theater director and a painter. I think he was involved in political activism, especially with left-wing causes. That seems to fit all the criteria mentioned. I don't think there's another person who fits all those roles exactly. So the answer should be Dario Fo.
