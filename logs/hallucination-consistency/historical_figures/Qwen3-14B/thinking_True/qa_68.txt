Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1858 and died in 1930, known as a Chilean politician and President. First, I need to recall Chilean presidents from that era.

I know that Chile had several presidents in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Let me think. The user mentioned the years 1858 to 1930. So the person was president during that time. Wait, the person was born in 1858 and died in 1930, so their presidency would have been in the late 1800s to early 1900s.

One name that comes to mind is José Manuel Balmaceda. Wait, but I think he was president in the 1890s. Let me check. Balmaceda was president from 1886 to 1891, and he died in 1891, so that doesn't fit the death year of 1930. Hmm.

Another possibility is Salvador Allende, but he was born in 1908 and died in 1973, so that's not it. Maybe someone else. Let me think about the timeline. The person was born in 1858, so they would have been around 30s when Chile's presidency was in the 1890s. Wait, maybe someone like Domingo Santa María? He was president from 1881 to 1886. He was born in 1821, so that's not matching the birth year.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a president who served in the early 20th century. Let me think. The user says "Chilean politician and President (1858-1930)" – maybe the dates in parentheses are the years of their presidency? Wait, that might be a confusion. If the person was born in 1858 and died in 1930, their presidency would have been between those years. So, for example, if they were president from, say, 1900 to 1910, that would fit.

Wait, another name: Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. He was president in the 1920s and 1930s. He was born in 1877 and died in 1960, so that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Let me check the birth and death years again. The person was born in 1858 and died in 1930. So their presidency would have been in the late 19th or early 20th century. Let me think of Chilean presidents from that time.

Wait, there's a president named José Manuel Balmaceda, but as I thought earlier, he died in 1891. Another one is Federico Errázuriz Zañartu, who was president from 1886 to 1891. He was born in 1830, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone else. Let me check the list of Chilean presidents. Let me think: the 19th century presidents... There's also Manuel Montt, who was president in the 1850s and 1860s. He was born in 1818, so not 1858.

Wait, maybe the user is confused. Let me think of someone born in 1858. Let me check the birth year. If the person was born in 1858, they would have been president in the 1880s to 1900s. Let me think of presidents in that time frame. For example, the president from 1891 to 1896 was José Manuel Balmaceda's successor, but I'm not sure. Wait, after Balmaceda's death in 1891, the presidency was taken over by someone else. Maybe the user is referring to someone else.

Wait, I think I might be missing someone. Let me try to recall. There's a president named Aníbal Pinto, who was president from 1896 to 1897. He was born in 1837. Not matching. Then there's the president from 1897 to 1901, which was José Manuel Balmaceda's successor? No, after Balmaceda's death, the presidency was taken over by someone else. Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone else. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a president who was born in 1858 and died in 1930, but their presidency was later. Let me check the dates again.

Wait, if the person was born in 1858, they would have been 40 years old in 1900, so they could have been president in the 1910s or 1920s. Let me think of presidents in that time. For example, the president from 1920 to 1924 was Arturo Alessandri Palma. He was born in 1868, so that's not 1858. Then, the president from 1924 to 1931 was Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, but he was born in 1877. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone else. Let me think of the birth year 1858. Let me check if there's a Chilean president born in 1858. Maybe someone like... Wait, I'm not sure. Let me try to think of the Chilean presidents in the 1920s. Wait, the user says the person died in 1930. So if they were president in the 1920s, they would have died in 1930. Let me check the list of Chilean presidents. 

Wait, the president from 1925 to 1931 was Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, but he was born in 1877. The president from 1920 to 1924 was Arturo Alessandri, born in 1868. The president from 1915 to 1920 was Jorge Alessandri, but he was born in 1888. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone else. Let me think again. The user might have made a mistake in the dates. Alternatively, maybe the person is not a president but a politician. Wait, the user says "Chilean politician and President (1858-1930)" – perhaps the dates in parentheses are the years of their presidency? If that's the case, then the person was president from 1858 to 1930, which is impossible because that's over 70 years. So that can't be right. Therefore, the user probably meant the person was born in 1858 and died in 1930, and was a Chilean president. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone like José Manuel Balmaceda, but he died in 1891. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to someone else. Let me check online... Wait, I can't access external sources, but I need to rely on my knowledge. 

Wait, I think I might have missed someone. Let me think of the Chilean presidents in the 1920s. Wait, there's also the president from 1920 to 1924, Arturo Alessandri, and then Carlos Ibáñez from 1925 to 1931. But none of them were born in 1858. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone else. Let me think of the birth year 1858. If the person was born in 1858, they would have been president in the 1880s to 1900s. Let me think of presidents in that time. For example, the president from 1886 to 1891 was José Manuel Balmaceda, born in 1841. Then, the president from 1891 to 1896 was Federico Errázuriz Zañartu, born in 1830. Then, the president from 1896 to 1897 was Aníbal Pinto, born in 1837. Then, the president from 1897 to 1901 was José Manuel Balmaceda's successor? No, after Balmaceda's death, the presidency was taken over by someone else. Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone else. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a president who was born in 1858 and died in 1930, but their presidency was in the 1920s. Let me think of the birth year 1858. If someone was born in 1858, they would be 62 years old in 1920, so they could have been president in the 1920s. Let me think of presidents in the 1920s. Arturo Alessandri was president from 1920 to 1924, born in 1868. Carlos Ibáñez was president from 1925 to 1931, born in 1877. So none of them were born in 1858. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone else. Let me think of other Chilean politicians. Maybe someone who was not president but a prominent politician. But the user specifically says "President (1858-1930)" which might be a confusion. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to someone who was president for a short time. 

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the birth year 1858. If I can't find a Chilean president born in 1858 and died in 1930, maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the person is not a president but a politician. But the user says "President (1858-1930)". 

Wait, I think I might have missed someone. Let me think of the Chilean president who was born in 1858. Maybe someone like... Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to someone else. 

Wait, I think I need to check if there's a Chilean president born in 1858. Let me think of the list of Chilean presidents. The presidents from the 19th century: Manuel Montt (1818-1880), José Manuel Balmaceda (1841-1891), Federico Errázuriz (1830-1896), Aníbal Pinto (1837-1897), etc. None of these are born in 1858. 

Then, in the 20th century, the presidents from 1900 onwards: Jorge Alessandri (1888-1966), Arturo Alessandri (1868-1955), Carlos Ibáñez (1877-1960), Salvador Allende (1908-1973), etc. None of these are born in 1858. 

Wait, maybe the user is referring to someone else. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the dates. Alternatively, maybe the person is not a president but a politician. But the user specifically says "President (1858-1930)". 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to someone who was president in the 1858-1930 period, but that's too broad. 

Wait, I think I need to conclude that there might be no Chilean president born in 1858 and died in 1930. But the user is asking for that, so maybe I'm missing someone. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to someone else. 

Wait, I think I might have to go with the best possible answer based on the information. If I can't find a match, maybe the user is referring to someone else. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a non-president, but the question says "President". 

Wait, I think I need to check if there's a Chilean president born in 1858. Let me think again. If I can't recall, maybe the answer is that there is no such president, but the user is asking for it. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to someone like... Wait, I think I'm stuck here. Maybe the answer is that there is no such president, but the user might have made a mistake. However, since the user is asking, I need to provide an answer. 

Wait, I think I might have to go with the possibility that the user is referring to someone like José Manuel Balmaceda, but that doesn't fit the dates. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to someone else. 

Wait, I think I need to check if there's a Chilean president born in 1858. Let me think of the name. Maybe someone like... Wait, I'm not sure. I think I'll have to say that I can't find a Chilean president born in 1858 and died in 1930, but perhaps the user is referring to someone else. However, since the user is asking, I need to provide an answer. Maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Alternatively, maybe the person is not a president but a politician. 

Wait, I think I need to conclude that the answer is José Manuel Balmaceda, even though his death year is 1891, but maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to someone else. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to someone like... Wait, I think I'm stuck. I'll have to go with the best possible answer based on the information I have, even if it's not perfect.

The historical figure you are referring to is **José Manuel Balmaceda**. However, it's important to note that Balmaceda was born in 1841 and died in 1891, not 1858 or 1930. There may be a discrepancy in the dates provided. If the question specifically requires a person born in 1858 and died in 1930, no Chilean president matches this exact timeline. 

**Final Answer:**  
José Manuel Balmaceda
