Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1732 and died in 1799, known as the first president of the United States. Hmm, I need to recall the presidents of the US. The first president was George Washington, right? Let me check the dates. George Washington was born on February 22, 1732, and he died on December 14, 1799. That matches the years given. He was the first president, serving from 1789 to 1797. The user's description says '1st president of the United States (1732–1799)', which might be a bit confusing because his presidency was from 1789-1797, but the dates in parentheses are his birth and death years. So the answer should be George Washington. I don't think there's any other president who fits those exact birth and death years. Let me just confirm. Yes, definitely George Washington. No other president was born in 1732 and died in 1799. So the answer is George Washington.
