Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1431 and died in 1463, known as a French poet and criminal. Hmm. First, I need to think of French figures from that time period. The 15th century, so late Middle Ages. The dates are 1431 to 1463. Let me check some key events.

Wait, Joan of Arc was born in 1412 and died in 1431, so that's not matching. Maybe someone else. The user mentioned poet and criminal. So, a poet who was also a criminal. Maybe someone involved in some scandal or crime.

I recall that François Villon is a French poet from that era. Let me check his dates. François Villon was born around 1431, and he died in 1463. Yes, that fits. He was a poet, known for his works like "Le Lai de la Fauve" and "Le Testament." But he was also involved in criminal activities, such as theft and murder. He was imprisoned several times and even faced the death penalty, though he escaped execution. So, he's often referred to as a criminal poet. That seems to match the description. I think that's the person they're looking for.
