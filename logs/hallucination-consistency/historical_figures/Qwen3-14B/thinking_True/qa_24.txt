Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1908, died in 1973, and known as the 28th president of Chile. Hmm, first, I need to check if there's a president of Chile who fits those dates.

Wait, the 28th president of Chile... Let me think. Chile's presidents are listed in order. Let me recall some key figures. Salvador Allende was a president, but he was from the 1960s and 1970s. He was president from 1970 until 1973, when he was overthrown. But he was born in 1908, right? Let me confirm his birth and death dates. Salvador Allende was born on June 4, 1908, and died on September 11, 1973, during the coup. So that matches the dates given in the question. 

But wait, the user says "28th president of Chile (1908–1973)". Wait, the presidency term would be from 1970 to 1973, not 1908. The user might have made a mistake in the dates. But the birth and death years are 1908 and 1973, which align with Allende. Also, checking the list of Chilean presidents, Salvador Allende was the 15th president, not the 28th. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe the user is confused with the numbering. Let me check the actual list.

Looking up Chilean presidents: The 28th president would be someone else. Let me count. The first president was José Manuel Balmaceda (1891-1896). Then there were several others. Let me see, maybe the user is mistaken about the 28th president. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the 28th president of the United States, but that's Woodrow Wilson, who was president from 1913-1921. But the user specified Chile. 

Wait, maybe the user made a typo. If the person was president of Chile from 1970-1973, that's Salvador Allende, but he was the 15th president. The 28th president of Chile would be someone else. Let me check the list again. 

Looking up a list of Chilean presidents: The 28th president of Chile was Salvador Allende? No, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the order. For example, the 15th president was Allende. The 28th would be later. Wait, maybe the user is incorrect in the 28th part. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the 28th president of another country, but the question says Chile. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is confused between the president's term and their birth/death years. The person born in 1908 and died in 1973 is Salvador Allende, who was president of Chile from 1970 to 1973. The 28th president might be a mistake. But the user might have intended to refer to Allende, even if the numbering is wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the 28th president of the United States, but that's Woodrow Wilson, who was born in 1856 and died in 1924. So that doesn't fit. 

So, given the birth and death years, the only person that matches is Salvador Allende, even though the 28th president part might be incorrect. The user might have made a mistake in the numbering. Therefore, the answer is Salvador Allende.
