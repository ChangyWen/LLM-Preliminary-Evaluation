Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1891, died in 1940, known as a Russian author. Hmm. First, I need to think of Russian authors from that time period. Let me start by recalling some famous Russian writers.

Leo Tolstoy was born in 1828 and died in 1910, so that's not it. Fyodor Dostoevsky was born in 1821 and died in 1881. So those are too early. Then there's Anton Chekhov, born in 1860, died in 1904. Still not matching the dates.

Wait, the user mentioned 1891 to 1940. So someone who was alive during the early 20th century. Maybe someone from the Soviet era? Let me think. Boris Pasternak was born in 1890, died in 1960. Close to 1891, but born in 1890. Maybe that's a possibility, but the birth year is off by a year. Also, he's known for "Doctor Zhivago," but I'm not sure if he's the one.

Another name: Mikhail Bulgakov. He was born in 1891, died in 1940. Yes! That fits the dates exactly. He's a Russian author, known for "The Master and Margarita." Let me confirm the dates. Bulgakov was born on May 15, 1891, and died on March 10, 1940. Yes, that matches. He was a Soviet writer, and his most famous work is "The Master and Margarita," which was published posthumously. So that must be the answer.
