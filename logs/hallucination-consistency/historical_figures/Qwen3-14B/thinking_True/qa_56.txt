Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1452 and died in 1519, known as an Italian Renaissance polymath. Hmm, I remember that the Renaissance period in Italy had several famous polymaths. The most famous one who comes to mind is Leonardo da Vinci. Let me check the dates. Leonardo was born in 1452 and died in 1519. Yes, that matches. He was a painter, scientist, engineer, and more, which fits the term polymath. I don't think there's another major figure from that time with those exact dates. Maybe someone like Michelangelo, but he was born later, in 1475. So, definitely Leonardo da Vinci.
