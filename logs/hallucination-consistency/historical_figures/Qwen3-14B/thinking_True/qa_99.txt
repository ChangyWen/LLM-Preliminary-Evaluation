Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1917 and died in 1984, known as an Indian Prime Minister and politician. Hmm, I need to recall Indian PMs from that era.

First, I know that Indira Gandhi was a prominent figure. Let me check her dates. She was born in 1917, right? And she served as Prime Minister of India. When did she die? I think she was assassinated in 1984. Yes, that matches the dates given. So the answer should be Indira Gandhi. Let me confirm once more. Her birth year is 1917, death 1984, and she was indeed the Prime Minister. I don't think there's another PM from that time with those exact dates. Maybe someone else? Like Morarji Desai? No, he was born in 1896 and died in 1995. So Indira Gandhi is the correct answer here.
