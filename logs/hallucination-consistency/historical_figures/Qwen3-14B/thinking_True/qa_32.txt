Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1783, died in 1842, and known as a 19th-century French writer. Hmm. First, I need to think of French writers from the 19th century. Let me start with the dates. 1783 to 1842—that's a 59-year span. The 19th century is from 1801 to 1900, so this person was alive during the early 19th century.

Now, famous French writers... Victor Hugo comes to mind. Wait, when was he born? Let me recall. Victor Hugo was born in 1802, so that's too late. The user is looking for someone born in 1783. Maybe someone from the late 18th century. Let me think. Alexandre Dumas? No, he was born in 1824. That's after 1800. What about someone else?

Oh, maybe someone from the Romantic period. Let me check. The user mentioned 19th-century French writer, but the person was born in 1783, so they would have been active in the early 19th century. Let me think of authors born around that time. Let's see... Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr? No, he was born in 1808. Maybe someone else.

Wait, the name that comes to mind is... George Sand? No, she was born in 1804. Hmm. What about someone like Madame de Staël? She was born in 1766, died in 1817. Not matching the death year. Let me think again. Maybe a playwright or novelist. 

Wait, the user might be referring to someone like... Oh! Maybe the author of "The Red and the Black"? Stendhal? No, Stendhal was born in 1783. Wait, that's the birth year. Let me confirm. Stendhal, whose real name was Marie-Henri Beyle, was born on January 23, 1783, and died on March 23, 1842. Yes! That matches the dates exactly. He was a French writer, known for works like "The Red and the Black" and "The Charterhouse of Parma." He's considered a key figure in 19th-century French literature, part of the Romantic movement. So the answer should be Stendhal.
