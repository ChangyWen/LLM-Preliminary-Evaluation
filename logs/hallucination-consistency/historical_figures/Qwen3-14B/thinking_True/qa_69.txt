Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in -427 and died in -347, known as an ancient Greek philosopher. Hmm, first, I need to recall ancient Greek philosophers and their lifetimes.

Plato comes to mind. Wait, when was he born and died? Let me think. Plato was a student of Socrates and a teacher of Aristotle. I remember that Socrates was born around 470 BC and died in 399 BC. Plato was born later, maybe around 428 or 427 BC. His death date is around 347 BC. That matches the years given here: born -427 (which is 427 BC) and died -347 (347 BC). So that would be Plato. Let me double-check. Yes, Plato was born in 427 BC and died in 347 BC. He's one of the most famous ancient Greek philosophers, part of the Classical period. Other philosophers like Socrates were earlier, and Aristotle was a bit later. So the answer should be Plato.
