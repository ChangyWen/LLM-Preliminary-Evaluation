Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1707 and died in 1778, known as a Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist. Hmm. I remember that Carl Linnaeus is a famous Swedish scientist from that time period. Let me check the dates. Carl Linnaeus was born in 1707 and died in 1778. Yes, that matches. He's known for his work in taxonomy, creating the binomial nomenclature system. So his full name is Carl von Linn√©, but he's commonly referred to as Carl Linnaeus. I think that's the one they're looking for. Let me make sure there aren't any other notable Swedish scientists from that era with similar credentials. I don't recall any others fitting that exact description. Yeah, I'm pretty confident it's Carl Linnaeus.
