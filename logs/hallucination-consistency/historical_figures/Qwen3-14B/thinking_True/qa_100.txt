Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1803 and died in 1869, known as a French Romantic composer. Hmm, I need to recall composers from that era.

First, the time frame: 1803 to 1869. That's the 19th century. French Romantic composers... Let me think. The major French composers of the Romantic period include people like Berlioz, Debussy, maybe Bizet? Wait, Bizet was born in 1838, so that's too late. Debussy was born in 1862, so also too late. Berlioz was born in 1803. Let me check that. Hector Berlioz was born in 1803 and died in 1869. Yes, that fits. He's known for works like the "Symphonie Fantastique" and "Requiem." He was a key figure in the Romantic era, though he was French. Another possibility might be Chopin, but he was Polish, born in 1810. So Berlioz seems to be the correct answer here. I should confirm the dates again. Yes, Berlioz was born on December 11, 1803, and died on March 8, 1869. Definitely matches the criteria. So the answer is Hector Berlioz.
