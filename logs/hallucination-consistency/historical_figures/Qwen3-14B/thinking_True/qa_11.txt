Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1935, died in 1977, known as an American singer and actor. Hmm. First, I need to think of people who fit those birth and death years. 1935 to 1977 is a span of 42 years. Let me think of famous people from that era.

Wait, the user mentioned "American singer and actor." So someone who was both a singer and an actor. Let me think. Elvis Presley was born in 1935, right? He was a singer and also acted in some movies. But when did he die? I think he died in 1977. Yes, August 16, 1977. That matches the dates. So Elvis Presley fits the description. Let me double-check. Born in 1935, died in 1977, singer and actor. Yes, that seems right. I don't think there's another major figure with those exact dates. Maybe someone else, but Elvis is the most prominent one. I think that's the answer.
