Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1879 and died in 1955, known for being a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity.

First, I need to recall who fits those details. The theory of relativity is most famously associated with Albert Einstein. Let me check the dates. Albert Einstein was born in 1879 and died in 1955. He was indeed a German-born physicist, though he later became a Swiss and American citizen. His work on the special and general theories of relativity is well-known. 

I should make sure there aren't any other physicists from that time with similar credentials. For example, Niels Bohr was born in 1885, so that's later. Max Planck was born in 1858, so too early. Marie Curie was born in 1867, so not matching the 1879 birth year. 

Another check: Einstein's birth and death years are correct. Yes, he was born on March 14, 1879, and died on April 18, 1955. His contributions to physics, especially the theory of relativity, are his most notable achievements. 

I think that's the one. No other prominent physicists from that era fit the exact birth and death years and the specific contribution mentioned. So the answer should be Albert Einstein.
