Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1877 and died in 1960, known as a Chilean army officer and political figure. Hmm, I need to recall Chilean history from that era.

First, I know that Chile has had several notable military leaders. The time period from 1877 to 1960 spans a lot of history. Let me think about key figures. Maybe someone involved in the early 20th century? The user mentioned both army officer and political figure, so perhaps a general who also held political office.

Wait, there's a name that comes to mind: Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. Let me check his dates. He was born in 1877 and died in 1960. Yes, that matches. He was a Chilean general and politician. He served as the President of Chile twice, first from 1927 to 1931 and then again from 1952 to 1958. He was also a military leader, so that fits the description. I think that's the person they're looking for. Let me make sure there aren't others. Maybe someone else like Salvador Allende? No, he was born in 1908 and died in 1973. Not matching the dates. Another possibility could be General José Manuel Balmaceda, but he died in 1891. So, Carlos Ibáñez del Campo seems correct.
