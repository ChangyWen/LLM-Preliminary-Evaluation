Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1911, died in 1982, and known as the President of Chile during that time. Wait, the president of Chile from 1911 to 1982? That doesn't make sense because a president can't serve for 71 years. Chile's presidents typically serve shorter terms. Maybe the user made a mistake in the dates.

First, I need to check the birth and death years. If someone was born in 1911 and died in 1982, they would have been around 71 years old. Now, looking at Chilean presidents, the most notable one from that era is Salvador Allende. He was born in 1908 and died in 1973. But the user's dates are 1911-1982. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the user confused the dates. Let me think. Another possibility is that the person was president during part of that time. For example, Eduardo Frei Montalva was president from 1964 to 1970. But he was born in 1911. Let me check his dates. Eduardo Frei was born on April 20, 1911, and died on March 2, 1982. Yes, that matches the birth and death years given. He was president of Chile from 1964 to 1970. So the user might have mistakenly written the presidency duration as 1911-1982 instead of his actual presidency dates. But the question says "President of Chile (1911-1982)", which is incorrect. However, the person who fits the birth and death years is Eduardo Frei. So the answer is Eduardo Frei Montalva.
