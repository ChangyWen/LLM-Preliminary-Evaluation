Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1949, died in 2002, known as an American pornographic actress who later became an anti-porn activist.

First, I need to recall if there's a well-known person fitting that description. The key points are the birth and death years, the transition from porn actress to anti-porn activist. 

I remember that Linda Lovelace comes to mind. She was a famous porn actress in the 1970s, known for the film "Deep Throat." Later, she became an anti-pornography activist. Let me check her dates. She was born in 1949 and died in 2002. That matches the criteria. 

Wait, are there any other possibilities? Maybe someone else? I don't recall another prominent figure with that exact timeline and career shift. Linda Lovelace is the most prominent name associated with that transition. Her story is well-documented, including her later activism and the legal battles she had with her former husband, Chuck Traynor, over the rights to her image. 

Yes, I think that's the one. The answer should be Linda Lovelace.
