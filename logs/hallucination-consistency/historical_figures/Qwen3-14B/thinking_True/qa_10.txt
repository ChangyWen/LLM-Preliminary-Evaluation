Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1541 and died in 1614, known as a Greek painter, sculptor, and architect. Hmm, first, I need to recall or find someone from that time period with those characteristics.

Wait, the time frame is 1541 to 1614. That's the late Renaissance period. The person is Greek, so maybe from the Eastern Orthodox tradition? I know that during the Renaissance, there were many artists in Italy, but Greece was under Ottoman rule then. However, there might be some Greek artists who worked in the West.

Wait, there's a name that comes to mind: Theodoros Poulakis? No, he was born in the 17th century, maybe later. Let me think. Another possibility is someone from the Cretan School. Oh, there's a painter named El Greco, but he was born in 1541 in Crete, which was part of the Ottoman Empire at the time. His name was Domenikos Theotokopoulos, but he's known as El Greco, meaning "The Greek." He was a painter, sculptor, and architect. Let me check the dates. Yes, he was born in 1541 and died in 1614. That matches the dates given. He's known for his unique style, blending Mannerism with elements of the Renaissance. So the answer should be El Greco, whose real name was Domenikos Theotokopoulos. But the user might be looking for the more commonly known name, El Greco. Let me confirm the dates again. Yes, he was born in 1541 and died in 1614. He was indeed a painter, sculptor, and architect. So that's the person they're asking about.
