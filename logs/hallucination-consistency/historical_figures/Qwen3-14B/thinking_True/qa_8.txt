Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1840 and died in 1926, known as a French impressionist painter. Hmm, I need to recall the major French impressionist painters from that time period.

First, I know that the Impressionist movement was in the late 19th century. Some key figures include Monet, Renoir, Degas, and maybe Sisley. Let me check their birth and death years. Monet was born in 1840, right? I think he died in 1926. Yes, that's correct. He was one of the founders of Impressionism. Renoir was born in 1841, so that's not matching. Degas was born in 1834, so he's out. Sisley was born in 1839, so also not 1840. 

Wait, let me confirm Monet's dates. Yes, Claude Monet was born on November 14, 1840, and died on December 5, 1926. He's definitely the one. The user mentioned 'French impressionist painter (1840-1926)', which matches Monet's lifespan. I don't think there's another major Impressionist painter with those exact dates. So the answer should be Claude Monet.
