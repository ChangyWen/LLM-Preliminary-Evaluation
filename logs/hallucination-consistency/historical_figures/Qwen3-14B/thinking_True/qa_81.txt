Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1890, died in 1974, known as a Russian architect and painter. Hmm. First, I need to think of Russian architects and painters from that time period.

I know that the Soviet Union was around during that time, so maybe someone from the early 20th century. Let me think. There's a famous architect named Konstantin Melnikov. Wait, when was he born? I think he was born in the late 1800s. Let me check my memory. Melnikov was born in 1890, right? And he died in 1974. Yes, that matches the dates. He was known for his work in Constructivist architecture and also did some painting. So he fits the description. Another possibility might be someone like El Lissitzky, but he was born in 1890 as well? Wait, no, El Lissitzky was born in 1890, but he was more of a painter and designer, part of the Bauhaus movement. But he died in 1941, so that doesn't fit the death year. Then there's Vladimir Tatlin, but he died in 1953. So Melnikov seems to be the one. Let me confirm the dates again. Konstantin Melnikov was born on April 1, 1890, and died on March 19, 1974. Yes, that's correct. He was a Russian architect and painter associated with the Constructivist movement. So the answer should be Konstantin Melnikov.
