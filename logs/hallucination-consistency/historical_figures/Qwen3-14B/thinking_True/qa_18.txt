Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1915, died in 2006, and known as a general and politician from Chile. Hmm. First, I need to recall Chilean political figures from that era.

I know that Salvador Allende was a significant figure in Chile, but he was born in 1908 and died in 1973. So that's not matching the dates. Then there's Augusto Pinochet, but he was born in 1915 and died in 2006. Wait, that fits the birth and death years. Let me check his roles. Pinochet was a general and later the president of Chile, right? He led a military coup in 1973, which overthrew Allende. So he was a general and a politician. That seems to fit the description given. Let me confirm the dates again: born 1915, died 2006. Yes, that's correct. I think that's the person they're looking for.
