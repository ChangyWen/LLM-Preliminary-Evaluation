Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1162 and died in 1227, known as the founder and first khan of the Mongol Empire.

First, I need to recall key figures from Mongol history. The Mongol Empire was established by Genghis Khan, right? But wait, his birth and death years... I think he was born around 1162. Let me check that. Yes, Genghis Khan, whose real name was Temujin, was born in 1162. He died in 1227, which matches the dates given. He is indeed recognized as the founder of the Mongol Empire. 

Wait, but sometimes people confuse him with other leaders. For example, Kublai Khan was his grandson, who founded the Yuan Dynasty in China. But the question specifies the founder of the Mongol Empire, so that's definitely Genghis Khan. 

I should make sure there's no other figure with those dates. Let me think. There's also Ögedei Khan, his son, who was the second Great Khan, but he was born later, around 1186. So no, the answer must be Genghis Khan. 

Another point: the term "khan" is used for the leaders of the Mongol Empire. Genghis Khan was the first to take that title, unifying the Mongol tribes. So yes, the answer is Genghis Khan.
