Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1932, died in 1986, known as a Soviet and Russian filmmaker, writer, film editor, film theorist, and theatre and opera director.

First, I need to recall filmmakers from that era. The Soviet Union was around until 1991, so someone born in 1932 would have been active during the mid-20th century. Let me think of notable directors from that time. Andrei Tarkovsky comes to mind. He was born in 1932 and died in 1986. He's famous for films like "Stalker" and "Solaris." He was also a writer and film theorist. His work often had philosophical themes, which aligns with being a film theorist. Additionally, he directed theatre and opera, though I'm not sure about the opera part. Wait, Tarkovsky did work in theatre, but I think his main contributions were in film. However, the user mentioned theatre and opera director as well. Maybe there's another person?

Alternatively, maybe it's someone else. Let me check the dates again. Born 1932, died 1986. Tarkovsky fits that. Another possibility is Sergei Eisenstein, but he died in 1948. Not matching. Maybe someone from the later Soviet period. Another thought: maybe Andrei Konchalovsky? He was born in 1938, so that's too late. Or maybe someone like Georgiy Daneliya? He was born in 1924, so not 1932. 

Wait, Tarkovsky's birth and death dates: he was born on December 4, 1932, and died on December 29, 1986. Yes, that matches. He was a filmmaker, writer, film editor, and film theorist. He also directed plays, though I'm not certain about opera. But the user might be referring to Tarkovsky. I think that's the best fit here. I'll go with Andrei Tarkovsky.
