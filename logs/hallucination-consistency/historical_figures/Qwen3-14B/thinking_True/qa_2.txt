Okay, let's see. The user is asking for a historical figure born in 1952, died in 2001, known as an English writer and humorist. Hmm. First, I need to think of notable English writers and humorists from that time frame.

Wait, 1952 to 2001. So the person would have been around during the late 20th century. Let me think. Douglas Adams comes to mind. He was the author of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." Let me check his dates. He was born in 1952, right? And he died in 2001. Yes, I think that's correct. He was a British writer, known for his humor and science fiction. That fits the description. Are there any others? Maybe someone else? But I can't think of another prominent English humorist from that era with those exact birth and death years. I think Douglas Adams is the one.
