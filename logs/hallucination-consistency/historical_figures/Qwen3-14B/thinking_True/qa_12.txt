Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1564 and died in 1642, known as an Italian mathematician, physicist, philosopher, and astronomer. Hmm, I need to think of someone from that time period in Italy.

First, the dates: 1564 to 1642. That's the 16th and 17th centuries. I remember that Galileo Galilei was a prominent figure during that time. Let me check his dates. Yes, Galileo was born in 1564 and died in 1642. He was an Italian scientist, which fits the description. He's known for his work in physics, astronomy, and mathematics. He also had philosophical contributions, like his support for the Copernican heliocentric model, which was controversial at the time. 

Wait, are there any other notable Italians from that period? Maybe someone like Leonardo da Vinci, but he was born in 1452 and died in 1519, so that's not matching. Then there's Nicolaus Copernicus, but he was Polish and born in 1473, died in 1543. Not matching the dates. 

Another possibility could be Johannes Kepler, but he was German, born in 1571, so a bit later than 1564. So that's not it. 

So, going back, Galileo Galilei seems to be the only one that fits all the criteria: Italian, born in 1564, died in 1642, and known for those fields. I think that's the answer. Let me just confirm once more. Yes, Galileo Galilei is the correct person here.
