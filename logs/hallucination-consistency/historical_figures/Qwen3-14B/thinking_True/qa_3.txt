Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1809 and died in 1865, known as the 16th president of the United States. Hmm, I need to recall U.S. presidents and their dates.

First, I know that Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president. Let me check his dates. He was born in 1809, right? Yes, February 12, 1809. And he was assassinated in 1865, during the Civil War. That matches the dates given. So the answer should be Abraham Lincoln. I don't think there's another president with those exact dates. Let me double-check. The 16th president is definitely Lincoln. His presidency was from 1861 to 1865, and he was born in 1809. Yep, that's correct. No other president fits that description. So the answer is Abraham Lincoln.
