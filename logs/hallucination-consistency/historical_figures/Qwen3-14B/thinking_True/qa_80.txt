Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of a historical figure born in 1927, died in 2010, and known as a Dutch writer. Hmm. First, I need to think of Dutch writers from that time period.

I know that Anne Frank was a famous Dutch writer, but she was born in 1929 and died in 1945. So that doesn't fit the birth and death years here. Wait, the user said born in 1927 and died in 2010. Let me think of other Dutch authors.

There's Harry Mulisch, but I think he was born in 1927. Let me check. Yes, Harry Mulisch was born on April 18, 1927, and he died on April 16, 2010. He was a Dutch writer, known for works like "The Assault" (De Aanslag). That seems to fit the criteria. Let me confirm the dates again. Born 1927, died 2010. Yes, that matches. I don't think there's another prominent Dutch writer with those exact dates. So the answer should be Harry Mulisch.
