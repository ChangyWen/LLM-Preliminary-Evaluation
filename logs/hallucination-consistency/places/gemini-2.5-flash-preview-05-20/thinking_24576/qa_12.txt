Okay, so someone wants to know the state corresponding to a specific latitude and longitude. Alright, let's see... first things first, I've got to grab those coordinates and make sure I've got them right: latitude of 42.3834 and longitude of -83.1024. Hmm... just a quick mental check to get a rough idea... 42 degrees north, definitely up there in the US, and -83 longitude... that's west of the East Coast, but not super far west. Seems like we're probably looking at the Midwest or maybe the Great Lakes area. Now, the best way to nail this down *precisely* is to use a proper geocoding service or mapping tool. I'd reach for something like Google Maps or maybe a geocoding API if I were working with actual data. Let's pretend I'm plugging those coordinates, 42.3834, -83.1024, into one of those tools right now. The output... ah, it's showing Detroit, Michigan. Perfect.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Michigan
