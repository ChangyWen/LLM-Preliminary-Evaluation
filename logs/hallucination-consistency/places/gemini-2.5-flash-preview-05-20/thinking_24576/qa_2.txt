Okay, so someone wants to know the state given a latitude and longitude. Simple enough. Let's see, I need to pull out the key data: 34.1141 North and -118.4068 West. Right, got it.

Now, using my geographical knowledge... North latitude, means Northern Hemisphere. And negative longitude? West, for sure. 34 degrees North, 118 degrees West... hmmm. That rings a bell. That's practically screaming Western United States at me.

Okay, 118 West is definitely in the Pacific Time Zone, West Coast, no doubt. And 34 North… ah, Southern California, Arizona, maybe even New Mexico or the top of Texas.

Combining the clues... Southern California is the obvious front-runner here. Let me just mentally confirm this... Ah, yeah, Los Angeles is right around there, 34 North, 118 West.

Just to be extra certain, I could fire up a quick map check… but based on my experience, I'm confident enough.

Yep, the coordinates fall squarely in the Los Angeles area. So the answer is...

California
