Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the state corresponding to specific latitude and longitude coordinates. First things first, I need those coordinates. Alright, latitude is 42.6664 and longitude is -73.7987. Got it.

Now, to figure this out, a reverse geocoding API or a mapping service is the way to go, obviously. But since I don't have those tools right at my fingertips, I'll have to simulate it. Time to do a mental lookup, so to speak.

42.6664 north latitude... definitely in the northern hemisphere, and relatively far north in the US. -73.7987 longitude puts us west of the Prime Meridian, meaning the eastern US. Combining those clues, my instinct says somewhere in the Northeast. Hmm... a quick mental check... or, if I *really* wanted to... I could actually look it up. But I already have a pretty good idea. Those coordinates are right around... ah, yes, Albany, New York.

Alright, time to confirm that gut feeling. Albany is, indeed, in New York. Makes sense.

So, the final answer...

New York
