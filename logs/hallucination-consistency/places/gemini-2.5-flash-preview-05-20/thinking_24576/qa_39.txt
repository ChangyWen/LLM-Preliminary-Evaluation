Okay, the user needs the state for a given latitude and longitude. No problem. First things first, I have to remember how these coordinates work. Latitude is north-south, longitude is east-west. Positive latitude is north, negative is south. Positive longitude is east, negative is west. Right. 36.7335 North and -76.0435 West. Got it.

Now, let's picture this... 36 degrees north... that's roughly the mid-southern United States. And -76 degrees west? That puts us on the East Coast. Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland... those states spring to mind immediately.

-76 longitude is quite specific; I know the approximate lines of longitude through DC and NYC, so that gives me some context. That's practically the Chesapeake Bay, or just to the east of it. Then, the latitude, at about 36.7, right on the Virginia/North Carolina border, or maybe *just* north.

A quick cross-check, either mentally or with a tool, will confirm it. Yep, this is around Virginia Beach, VA. Specifically, the south end, practically right on the border with North Carolina.

Virginia.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Virginia
