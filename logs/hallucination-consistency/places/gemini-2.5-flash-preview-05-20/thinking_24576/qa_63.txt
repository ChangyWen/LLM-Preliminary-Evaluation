Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know the state, based on provided latitude and longitude coordinates. Easy enough, I've dealt with this a million times. First, I'll pull those numbers: 36.783 latitude and -119.7939 longitude. Now, I need a method. I could fire up a geocoding API, or I could get clever. Since this is just for a thought experiment, I'll do a mental lookup. I'm practically mapping this in my head.

Okay, 36.783 latitude… that’s somewhere in the middle of the country, generally south of the northern tier and north of the southern tier. And -119.7939 longitude… that's *way* out west, west of the prime meridian. Put those two together, and we’re looking at the West Coast or maybe just inland.

Now I narrow it down. -119 is definitely west of the Rockies. And 36-37 is a common latitude for a lot of states, the big ones like California, Nevada, and Arizona, and even places further east like New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina. Hmm... the longitude is key. -119 almost certainly means California or maybe Nevada. I'll do a quick mental cross-check. Yep, definitely California. Fresno area, to be exact.

Got it. Now I have to craft the final response, using the user's formatting requirements. Simple enough.
