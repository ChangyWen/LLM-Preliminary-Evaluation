*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's my thought process in response to this query. First, I need to nail down what's being asked: the user wants the state for a given latitude and longitude. Alright, got it.

Now, let's break down the coordinates. Latitude is 42.2705, and longitude is -71.8079. Right off the bat, I start doing a quick mental triage, drawing on my geographical expertise. Latitude 42 screams northern US, definitely not the deep south. And -71 longitude? That's firmly in the eastern half of the country, leaning heavily towards the East Coast. Putting it all together, my mental map immediately flags New England as the likely region.

While I could make an educated guess based on that, I need to be precise. The most reliable method, and the way I'd actually *do* this if I had the tools at my disposal, would be to leverage a geocoding service, or maybe just quickly type it into Google Maps. Think of it as an automated lookup. The input would be 42.2705 and -71.8079. The output I *expect* to see, given my years of working with this, would be Worcester, Massachusetts, or a location very close by.

So, I'm essentially going to verify my initial assessment with that lookup. And if the results confirm what I already suspect, I'm ready to respond definitively.

Massachusetts
