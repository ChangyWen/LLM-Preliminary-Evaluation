Okay, so the core question is: they want the U.S. state for a given latitude and longitude. Simple enough. This is a geospatial problem, so I need to perform a lat/long to location lookup. Let's see... I know these coordinates. 32.7817 latitude tells me southern US, -97.3474 longitude tells me somewhere west of the Mississippi, but not too far west, and definitely in the Western Hemisphere, of course. Combining those, I'm thinking Texas, maybe Oklahoma, Arkansas, or Louisiana. Hmm... the numbers are pretty specific, though. I could probably just picture it on a map in my head, but I could also quickly do an online search â€“ something like "latitude 32.7817 longitude -97.3474" or use a mapping program. Wait, I remember! Those coordinates are right around Fort Worth. Yup, a quick mental check confirms it. So, the answer is Texas.

Texas
