Okay, let's break this down. The user's asking for the U.S. state based on a latitude and longitude pair. Simple enough. My first instinct, of course, is to reach for a geocoding solution. I mean, that's the whole point of these services: turning coordinates into human-readable addresses, including the state.

So, I would immediately think, alright, which mapping tool do I want to use? Since the instructions tell me I can use either a mental or actual search, I'll do it mentally, but the process is the same. I'd feed those coordinates, 41.7661, -72.6834, into, let's say, Google Maps. 

I would then patiently watch as it centers the view, and, knowing the area fairly well, I see it pops up somewhere near Farmington/New Britain.

Consequently, now that I have pinpointed the location, I would clearly identify the state and finalize my answer.

Connecticut
