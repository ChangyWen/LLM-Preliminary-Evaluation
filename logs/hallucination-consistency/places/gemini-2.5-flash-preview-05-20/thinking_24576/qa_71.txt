Okay, let's see. The user wants to know the state, given a latitude and longitude. Right, that means I need to do some geocoding – reverse geocoding, to be precise, converting coordinates to a location. Let's get to it.

Latitude is 37.9722, so that's in the Northern Hemisphere. Longitude is -122.0016, which is in the Western Hemisphere. Now to mentally process this… 37-38 degrees north latitude puts us somewhere in the mid-latitudes of the US, or possibly southern Europe or parts of Asia. And negative 122 longitude... that's *very* far west, almost the West Coast of the US, or maybe even the Pacific Ocean!

Combining those two gives a strong indication of the Western United States. Hmmm, but specifically, -122 longitude is practically hugging the coast, which means California, Oregon, or Washington are likely. Knowing my geography, and my knowledge of California in particular, with a latitude of 37-38 degrees, that points directly to central or northern California. The San Francisco Bay Area is in the general vicinity.

To be extra sure, and to be precise, I would ideally quickly check a map, or use an API, but from memory, 37.9722, -122.0016 is very close to Lafayette, Orinda, and Walnut Creek area in Contra Costa County, California. Therefore, the final answer is:

California
