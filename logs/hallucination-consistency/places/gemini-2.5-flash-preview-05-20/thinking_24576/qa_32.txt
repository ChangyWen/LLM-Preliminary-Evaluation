Okay, here's how I'd approach this. First, I need to understand the prompt. The user needs the state given a latitude and longitude. Simple reverse geocoding. My brain immediately jumps to that core function. I'll convert those coordinates into a location name.

Now, let's break down the coordinates themselves. Latitude 40.7834 - positive, so we're in the Northern Hemisphere. That latitude feels familiar; roughly the US, maybe southern Europe, or even central Asia. Then, longitude -73.9662 – negative, so we're in the Western Hemisphere. Minus 73 degrees West is right around the eastern United States, or eastern Canada.

Putting those two pieces together…Eastern US, around 40 degrees north. That's practically screaming the Northeast. Wait a minute... 40.78 North, -73.96 West... those coordinates are *very* familiar. I practically know those. That has to be New York City. If I were unsure, I'd mentally (or, if necessary, physically) access a mapping tool, or a geocoding API to double-check.

I'm pretty confident, but let's just do a quick mental check. NYC is in New York State, so that checks out. If I really needed to verify, I'd just punch the coordinates into a search and verify.

Now, to format the answer properly. Explanation first, single line final answer at the end:

The location is New York City, which is in New York State.

New York
