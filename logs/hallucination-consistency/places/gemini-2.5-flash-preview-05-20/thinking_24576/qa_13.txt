Okay, let's see. The user wants the state for a specific lat/long. Alright, here we go. First, I need those coordinates. Let me see... it's 47.6211 north latitude and -122.3244 west longitude.

Right off the bat, that latitude tells me we're in the northern reaches, either the US or Canada. And with that longitude, we're definitely looking at the west coast. Hmm, putting that together, it screams Pacific Northwest. Washington, Oregon, maybe even British Columbia if we're close enough to the border.

Now, I could probably do a quick mental check here. I know the major cities in the general area: Seattle, Portland, Vancouver. But, to be sure, the best way to nail this down is a quick geocoding. Give me a second to visualize the map... or better yet, let's just use a mapping tool. I'm picturing Google Maps or OpenStreetMap here, or even a geocoding API.

Okay, simulating the lookup, I input those coordinates. Let's seeâ€¦ aha! That puts us squarely in Seattle, Washington.

Perfect. The user wants the state, so the answer is simple.

Washington
