Okay, let's break this down. The core task is to figure out which U.S. state a specific set of latitude and longitude coordinates belongs to. Simple enough.

First, a quick mental review of what those coordinates *mean*. Latitude is north/south, with positive values north of the equator. Longitude is east/west, with positive values east of the Prime Meridian. And of course, the U.S. is generally in the Northern and Western hemispheres. Got it.

Now, to the specifics. Latitude is 26.2252, which is positive, placing it north of the equator. Longitude is -98.2467, indicating itâ€™s west of the Prime Meridian.

I need to mentally, or physically if I wasn't sure, visualize where these coordinates are. 26 degrees north latitude... that's down south, think Florida, Texas, maybe Louisiana. -98 degrees west longitude is more towards the central U.S., maybe Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas.

Putting it together... southern and central U.S... that strongly suggests Texas.

Just to be certain, in a real-world situation, I'd do a quick check, perhaps using a mapping tool or a quick web search. That would confirm this is in the Rio Grande Valley area of Texas.

So, the answer is clear.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Texas
