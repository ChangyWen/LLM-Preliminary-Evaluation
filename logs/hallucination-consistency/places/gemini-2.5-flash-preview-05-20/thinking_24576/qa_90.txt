Okay, let's break this down. The user needs the state corresponding to a specific latitude and longitude. Alright, that means I need to use geocoding, specifically *reverse* geocoding since I'm going from coordinates to a place name.

Let's see... the given coordinates are 37.6895 North, -97.3443 West. Okay, mentally, 37 degrees north... that's a good chunk up from the Southern border, not too far North. And -97 West... well west of the Mississippi, but not out into the Rockies or the coast. Central plains, then. I'd guess... Kansas, maybe Oklahoma or southern Nebraska or Missouri. I need to be more precise.

To confirm, or if I'm unsure, a quick lookup is the best bet. A search for "latitude 37.6895 longitude -97.3443" or just popping those coordinates into a mapping tool will give me the exact location in seconds.

Aha! That lands right in Wichita, Kansas.

So, the answer isâ€¦ Kansas.

Kansas
