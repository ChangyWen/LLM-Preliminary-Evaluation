Okay, here's how I'd approach this. The user wants to know the US state for a given lat/long. Simple enough. Let me thinkâ€¦ the quickest method is definitely to reverse geocode. For something like this, I wouldn't bother with a programmatic solution using a geocoding API; that's overkill. Google Maps, or any similar mapping tool with reverse geocoding capabilities, will be perfect. Easy peasy.

Let's see, the coordinates are `33.5722, -112.0892`. Right, I'll jump over to Google Maps. Pop those coordinates into the search bar and hit enter. The map should center right on the location and display a placemark with the relevant information, including the city and, crucially, the state. Now I just scan the displayed information for the state's name... Aha!

Arizona
