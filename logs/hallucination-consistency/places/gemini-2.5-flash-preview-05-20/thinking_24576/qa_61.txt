Okay, let's break this down. The user is after the state associated with a specific set of coordinates. My first step is to isolate those coordinates â€“ latitude 43.168 and longitude -77.6162. Right, got it. Now, I need to convert those coordinates into a recognizable location. I immediately think of the standard tools: Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, or even a dedicated geocoding API. I could mentally visualize this, but let's be thorough. I'd input those coordinates, 43.168, -77.6162, into one of these services. Just a quick look... ah, there it is. Rochester, NY, pops right up. That's the key! The result nails down the city. Now I extract the requested information. The state is New York. Easy. Time to format the answer.

New York
