Okay, here's what's going through my head:

First things first, the core of the question: I need to figure out the state based on a latitude and longitude. Easy enough.

Now, let's run through the lat/long basics. Latitude is north/south, 0 at the equator, 90 at the poles. 41.3113? That's positive, so we're north of the equator. Longitude is east/west, and we're talking about the Prime Meridian here, ranging from -180 to +180. -72.9246 is negative, putting us in the Western Hemisphere.

Right, next step is formulating a search. I'd probably type something like "latitude 41.3113 longitude -72.9246 state" or even just "what state is 41.3113, -72.9246 in."

Now, let's do a quick mental check, or maybe a fast Google search, to pinpoint the actual location. I know it is in the northeast.

Okay, from memory and quick check. Those coordinates pretty much scream New Haven, Connecticut.

The answer is there. Now, I just need the state name.

And, finally, the answer, formatted as requested:
Connecticut
