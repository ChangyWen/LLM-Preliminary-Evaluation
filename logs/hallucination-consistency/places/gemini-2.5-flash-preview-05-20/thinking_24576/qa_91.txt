Okay, here's how I'd approach this, thinking through the process step-by-step as I would if I were actually figuring it out.

Alright, the task is clear: the user needs to know the state corresponding to a latitude and longitude. That's the core request. The user provided specific coordinates, so the first thing I need to do is pull those out to work with them.

I see the numbers: Latitude is 41.6638, and Longitude is -83.5827. Got it.

Now, the best way to proceed. In my line of work, a quick mental check is always a good starting point to get an idea. Seeing that those coordinates are a positive latitude and a negative longitude immediately tells me we're dealing with North America, specifically within the US. That narrows it down substantially. The most precise method, of course, would be using an external resource. It needs to be a geocoding service, or a mapping tool.

Now, I'd "mentally" (or, were I a person, actually) get to it. I'd plug those coordinates – 41.6638, -83.5827 – into a reliable geocoding API (Google Maps, for example, would be perfect) or a mapping service.

I'd then take a look at the output. Looking at this hypothetically, I'd expect a result showing a location near Toledo. And Toledo is in Ohio, so I have the state.

Now, for the final output:

Ohio
