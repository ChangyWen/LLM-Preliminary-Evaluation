Okay, here's my thought process.

First, the core issue: the user needs a state name given some coordinates, latitude and longitude. Alright, that’s a straightforward geocoding problem, specifically, reverse geocoding. I'll need to find a tool that can do that conversion.

Now, let's see… the coordinates. Latitude 32.8168… Okay, that’s comfortably in the southern US. Longitude -79.9687… right, that puts it on the East Coast. Thinking geographically, with -75 longitude being roughly NYC, and -80 roughly Florida/Georgia/South Carolina… I immediately picture the southeast coast: Georgia, South Carolina, maybe North Carolina, or perhaps even northern Florida.

I'll refine this with a little more precision. I could do a mental check, given my familiarity, or I could grab a tool – maybe a quick search online for those coordinates. Either way, my mental map tells me this is Charleston, South Carolina.

Alright, I’m ready to deliver the answer.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
