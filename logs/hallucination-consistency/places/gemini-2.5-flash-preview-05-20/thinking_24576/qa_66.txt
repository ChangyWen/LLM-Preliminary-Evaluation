Okay, let's break this down. The user needs the state for a specific set of coordinates. Alright, that's pretty straightforward. First thing's first: what tool do I reach for? A geocoder. Specifically, I need something that can translate latitude and longitude into a place name, and from there, I can pull the state.

Since it's just a single lookup, firing up a geocoding API and writing a script would be overkill. I could, of course, but why bother? The simplest, most direct approach is to use an online map service like Google Maps. It's quick, easy to access, and does exactly what I need.

Right, so, I'd mentally, or physically, open Google Maps and type in the coordinates: 39.7805, -84.2003. Then, I'd wait for the map to center on the location and look at the address that pops up.

Analyzing the resultâ€¦ Dayton, Ohio. Okay, perfect. It provides the city, the state, and usually the zip code, all in one convenient package.

Now, to get to the core of the answer: I just need the state. From what I see, the state is Ohio.

Therefore, the answer is: The location with latitude 39.7805 and longitude -84.2003 is in Ohio.
