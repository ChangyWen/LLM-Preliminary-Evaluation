Okay, let's break this down. First, the user wants the state corresponding to specific latitude and longitude coordinates. Easy enough. I need to get those coordinates, which are 39.3051 and -76.6144. Now, the simplest way to handle this is to use a geocoding tool. I could fire up Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, or a quick API call. Either way, I'd plug those coordinates in and get a location.

Let's do a quick mental lookup... alright, those coordinates point to Baltimore, Maryland. Okay, now to provide the answer and hit the format requirements.

First, I can say: "The coordinates 39.3051, -76.6144 are located in Baltimore, Maryland.

Maryland"
