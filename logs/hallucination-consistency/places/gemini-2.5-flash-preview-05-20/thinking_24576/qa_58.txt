Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to figure out what the user *actually* wants. They're looking for a state, given a specific latitude and longitude. Got it.

Alright, let's grab those coordinates. Latitude is 41.2627, and longitude is -96.0529. Now, what's the best way to translate those numbers into a state? Since I don't have a live geocoding service available, I'll have to simulate it using my understanding of US geography, which is a pretty powerful tool in itself. I've got a pretty good grasp of where things are generally.

First, a quick sanity check. 41.2627 north latitude puts us in the northern half of the country, definitely not Florida or anything south of the Mason-Dixon line. And -96.0529 longitude? West of the Mississippi, but not super far west â€“ nothing like California or even Colorado. It's a central US location.

Time to get more precise, to narrow things down. -96 degrees longitude runs right through states like Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and maybe even scraping the Dakotas. 41 degrees latitude is slicing through Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and even heading into New York.

Now, where do those ranges intersect? Right in the middle of Nebraska, it seems.

Wait... let's verify that hunch. I can mentally picture it, and I'm pretty sure Omaha, Nebraska, is located right around there. Yep, those coordinates are specifically for a location within Omaha.

So, the answer should be obvious.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Nebraska
