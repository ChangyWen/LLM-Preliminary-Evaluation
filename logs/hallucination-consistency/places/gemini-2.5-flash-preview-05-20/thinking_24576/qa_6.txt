Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the state, given latitude and longitude. Alright, let's break this down. First, latitude is North/South, so 29.786 is North. Then longitude is East/West, and -95.3885 is West. I'm visualizing this... 29.786 N, that's in the Northern Hemisphere, definitely. Being in the low 30s means southern US, or maybe the Caribbean. And -95.3885 West, that's squarely in North America, west of the prime meridian.

Combining those two, it's got to be in the Southern US, and west of the Mississippi, but not too far west like California. Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, or Oklahoma come to mind immediately. Hmmm, this 29.786 latitude is pretty close to 30 degrees North, which is around Houston and New Orleans. And -95.3885 longitude is West of New Orleans but East of Dallas and San Antonio.

These coordinates... 29.786, -95.3885... Wait a second, I know those. That's Houston, Texas! I'm pretty sure.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Texas
