Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I'm asked to identify the U.S. state given a latitude and longitude. That's a pretty straightforward geocoding task, something I've handled countless times, and I have a pretty good internal map in my head. The first thing I need to do is grab those coordinates. Let's see... 30.0687 and -89.9288. Right.

Now, time to translate those numbers into a state. Latitude 30 puts us in the southern part of the country. And a longitude of -89? That places us in the central-ish southern region. Let's think… that means it’s likely Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, or maybe Texas.

I've got a mental image… -89 feels *very* close to New Orleans. I'll quickly confirm that, just to be sure. Yep, those coordinates are right there. And New Orleans, of course, is in Louisiana. Okay, I’ve got it.

Now to formulate the answer. I know there’s a specific formatting requirement. I need to answer on a new line at the end. So I'll state it clearly.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Louisiana
