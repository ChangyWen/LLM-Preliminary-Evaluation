Okay, let's break this down. The user wants the state given a latitude and longitude, and they want it clearly presented at the end, on a new line. No problem.

First things first, I need the coordinates. Let's see: 41.823 for latitude, and -71.4187 for longitude. Right.

Now, the quickest and most reliable way to convert coordinates to a location is obviously using a mapping service. Google Maps is the obvious choice, but any similar tool would do the trick. As a quick mental check, though, I can kind of triangulate it. 41-something latitude, that's well north, definitely in the US. -71-something longitude... that's quite far east. Hmm, probably New England somewhere.

Alright, time to execute the lookup. Just plugging those coordinates, `41.823, -71.4187`, into Google Maps... boom, directly to Providence, Rhode Island.

So, to answer the user's question, the state is...

Rhode Island
