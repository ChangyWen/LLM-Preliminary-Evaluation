Okay, let's break this down. I need to find the U.S. state for a given set of coordinates – that's the core problem. Right, this is a geocoding task, specifically reverse geocoding. I've got a few options here: Google Maps API is a workhorse for this, Nominatim from OpenStreetMap would also be a good shout, or heck, even a basic search engine query would probably do the trick in a pinch. Let me grab the coordinates: 40.5961, -75.4756.

Now, let's analyze. Latitude 40-something North, that’s comfortably in the continental US, no doubt. The longitude is negative 75-something West. That puts us west of the Prime Meridian, definitely on the East Coast, probably in the Eastern Time Zone. Right around that longitude is Philadelphia. So, if I were using an external tool, I'd formulate a query like "40.5961, -75.4756 what state?" or maybe "latitude 40.5961 longitude -75.4756 location."

Okay, without running the query right now I can *simulate* the results. Based on my knowledge, that puts it near Allentown/Bethlehem, which is in Pennsylvania. The answer needs to be just the state name. Does that address the initial question? Yep. Does it meet the required format? Yes.

State name.
