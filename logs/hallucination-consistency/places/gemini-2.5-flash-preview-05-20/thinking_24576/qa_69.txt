Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The task is straightforward: pinpoint the U.S. state given a latitude and longitude. No problem.

First, I mentally review the coordinate basics. Latitude: positive is north, negative is south, zero is the equator. Longitude: positive is east, negative is west, with zero at the Prime Meridian. Easy enough.

Now, for the given coordinates: the latitude is 26.6443, positive, putting it in the Northern Hemisphere. And at -81.9957 longitude, we are in the Western Hemisphere.

Considering the latitude of 26 degrees North, that's pretty far south in the continental U.S. It makes me think of the Gulf Coast, at a minimum. Then, -81 degrees West longitude. That's east coast, almost but not quite at the eastern edge.

Now I have to narrow this down. Latitude 26N makes me think of Florida, the tip of Texas, or maybe the southern edges of Louisiana. But then, the longitude of -81W is almost certainly Florida, maybe dipping into Georgia, or the Carolinas, but highly unlikely in the last two, given the first cue.

Combining these, that's definitely Florida. It's a pretty solid deduction. 

I'll just quickly double-check in my mental map, and maybe a quick search just to be sure. Yep, those coordinates are absolutely in Florida, specifically near Fort Myers and Cape Coral.
