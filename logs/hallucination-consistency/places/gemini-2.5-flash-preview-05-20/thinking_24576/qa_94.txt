Okay, here's how I'd approach this. The user wants to know the U.S. state for a given lat/long. Right, so first, I need to figure out where those coordinates are. Let's see... 33.7977 North… that’s definitely in the southern US somewhere. Then, -118.167 West... ah, that puts us way out West. The combination of those numbers is screaming "Southern California" in my head.

Let me just quickly double-check that... 33 degrees north is somewhere around San Diego, Phoenix, maybe even Dallas, Atlanta... But 118 West... that's right in the neighborhood of Los Angeles. Yep, that intersection puts us in the LA area.

To be absolutely certain, I should probably pinpoint the exact location. I think, let me see, I'll just bring up a map in my head, but I’m pretty sure that area… Ah, yeah. A quick mental picture or a short web search confirms: those coordinates are located in Long Beach, California.

So, the user is looking for the state. Right. Got it.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.

California
