Okay, let's break this down. The core task is to figure out the U.S. state for a given latitude and longitude. Simple enough. First things first: Latitude is North/South, longitude is East/West. Positive latitude is North, negative is South. Positive longitude is East, negative is West. So, with a latitude of 32.8313 and a longitude of -117.1222, we're looking at a location that's north and west.

Now, I can start estimating. A latitude around 32-33 degrees North puts us in the southern tier of the US. Think Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Southern California. The longitude of -117 is pretty far West, so that immediately suggests we're in one of the western states. Combining those two, we're likely looking at Southern California or maybe extreme western Arizona.

Let me refine that. A longitude of -117 is *definitely* in California, not just near it. It puts us west of Arizona's main populated areas. And 32.8 degrees latitude... yeah, that's *very* Southern California. Specifically, I'm picturing the San Diego area. Just to be sure, a quick mental check, or a very fast search for "latitude 32.8 longitude -117.1" would confirm San Diego, California.

Now, formulate the answer.
