Okay, let's break this down. First, the user wants to know the state for a given latitude and longitude, simple enough. I've got the coordinates: latitude at 35.3529, longitude at -119.0359. Now, the method. I need to translate these geographical coordinates into a state. A geocoding API would be the cleanest, but if I'm doing this in my head, I can rely on my mental map of the US.

Let's start with longitude, -119. That immediately screams "West Coast." Certainly rules out most of the eastern and central states. Now, the latitude, 35.35. This is somewhere in the southern half of the US. Putting those two together, it's probably somewhere in California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, maybe the western part of Texas.

Okay, now to refine it. -119 degrees longitude is *very* west, west of the Sierra Nevada. It's almost certainly not in Nevada or Arizona. Latitude 35 degrees, that cuts across the southern portions of Tennessee, North Carolina, Oklahoma, northern Arizona, and southern California.

Time to cross-reference. If I were to place those coordinates on a map, or if I had a geocoding service handy, it's spot-on California. And specifically, that puts it in the southern Central Valley, probably near the Tehachapi Mountains.

Alright, I've got my answer.

As requested by the user, the state is California.
