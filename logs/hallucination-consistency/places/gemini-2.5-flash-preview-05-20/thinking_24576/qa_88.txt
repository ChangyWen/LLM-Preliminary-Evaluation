Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the state for a specific latitude and longitude. Easy enough. First, I'll break down how to get there. Latitude gives me the North/South position – positive is North, negative is South. Longitude tells me East/West, with positive being East and negative being West, relative to the Prime Meridian. 

Let's look at these coordinates. Latitude is 33.4015, so it's in the Northern Hemisphere, and that's a relatively low latitude – somewhere in the southern US, maybe. Longitude is -111.7178, which means it's in the Western Hemisphere, and that's a fairly large negative value, pointing to the western US.

So, we're looking at the southern, western US.

Now, let's get more specific. 33 degrees North roughly lines up with... okay, Southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and even parts of Florida. 

And -111 degrees West… that roughly crosses Eastern California, most of Nevada, Western Utah, and most of Arizona, and Western New Mexico.

The only state that's clearly common to both of those regions is Arizona. 

Just to double-check (because it’s always good practice), I’ll do a quick mental confirmation. Yep, that's in the Phoenix area. Definitely Arizona.

As requested by the user, the answer is:

**Arizona**
