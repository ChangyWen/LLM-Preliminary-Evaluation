Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core of this is straightforward: someone wants to know the U.S. state associated with a specific latitude and longitude. That's my starting point.

First things first, I need those coordinates. Let's see…39.1413 for the latitude and -84.506 for the longitude. Got it.

Now, how to solve this? The quickest, most reliable route here is definitely a geocoding API. Something like the Google Maps Geocoding API or maybe even OpenStreetMap Nominatim. They're purpose-built for exactly this. But, for a quick check, I could just do a quick search online – a "latitude 39.1413 longitude -84.506" query would probably turn something up fast.

Let's say I'm using a geocoding service (in my mind, of course). I'd input the coordinates: 39.1413, -84.506. The output? Well, that would pinpoint us to the Cincinnati area, as I recall.

And Cincinnati is, without a doubt, located in Ohio. Simple enough.

So the final answer? Here it is.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Ohio
