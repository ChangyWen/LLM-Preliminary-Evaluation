Okay, so someone wants to know the state for a specific latitude and longitude. Got it. Let's see… latitude 30.3322, that's positive, meaning we're north of the equator. Longitude -81.6749, negative, therefore west of the Prime Meridian. Alright, let's break this down. Thirty degrees north… that puts us in the southern US, maybe northern Mexico, or perhaps North Africa or the Middle East, but the longitude, eighty-one west, that’s pretty solidly in the eastern US, or maybe the Caribbean. 

Combining those two, thirty north and eighty-one west… that screams southeastern United States. Okay, which state? Florida’s a prime suspect; its northern parts and panhandle are around that latitude. Georgia could work too, maybe southern Georgia. Alabama and Mississippi are a little further west. South Carolina's a touch more north/east.

Hang on… let’s quickly pinpoint it. Ah, yes. Jacksonville, Florida. I know that city, it's roughly at 30.3 North, 81.6 West. That seals it!

The answer is: **Florida.**
