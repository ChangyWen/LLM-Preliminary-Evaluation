Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to understand the core task. The user needs the state given a latitude and longitude. Simple enough. And, crucially, the final answer needs to be isolated on a new line, which is good practice.

Right, I've got the data: 32.7935 latitude and -96.7667 longitude. Now, the smart play is to either mentally process it or, if I need a quick verification, use a geocoding tool. Since I'm good with geography, I'll start mentally.

Let's see… 32.7935 is definitely in the southern part of the U.S., and -96.7667 is firmly in the central U.S., west of the Mississippi. That narrows things down significantly. Thinking south and central, I'm picturing Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, or maybe Louisiana.

A quick internal check…or, honestly, I can *almost* pinpoint it. That's Dallas, Texas. Okay, yes, Dallas. Excellent.

Therefore, the state is Texas.

I need to construct the response so it provides context, and then the final state answer on a separate line, as requested.

The coordinates 32.7935 latitude and -96.7667 longitude point to a location within the city of Dallas.

Texas
