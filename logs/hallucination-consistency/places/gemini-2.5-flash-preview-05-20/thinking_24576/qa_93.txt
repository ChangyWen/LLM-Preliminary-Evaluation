Okay, here's how I'd approach this. The user wants a U.S. state based on a latitude and longitude – simple enough. Let's see, those coordinates are… right, 27.2796 North latitude and -80.3884 West longitude.

The most direct path here is to use a geocoding service or mapping software to convert those coordinates to a location. No need to reinvent the wheel. Latitude of around 27 degrees screams "southern" to me. And with a longitude of -80 degrees, we're definitely on the East Coast. Combining those two, I'm thinking Florida, maybe Georgia, or possibly one of the Carolinas.

To be precise, I'll do a mental check, maybe a quick glance at a map or using a geocoding tool. Hmm, 27.2796, -80.3884... that's right around Port St. Lucie. Ah, yes, I remember that area well.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Florida
