Okay, let's break this down. The user needs the state for a specific latitude and longitude. Easy enough. First things first, I've got to grab those coordinates â€“ 40.2457 latitude and -111.6457 longitude. Now, to get the state, I'll lean on my go-to method: geocoding. A quick look at those coordinates is revealing. Positive latitude, negative longitude... that places us firmly in the Northern Hemisphere and, more specifically, the Western Hemisphere. These numbers scream "Western United States" at me.

Alright, time to execute the query. In my head, I'm visualizing a map now. Or, if I were being practical, I'd just pop these into Google Maps or OpenStreetMap. I'm thinking Provo, Utah immediately springs to mind. Yep, 40.2457, -111.6457 - that's Provo, right there. So, Utah it is.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Utah
