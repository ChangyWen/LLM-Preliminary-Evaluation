Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core of this is straightforward: someone wants to know the state based on a latitude and longitude. My first instinct is to grab the coordinates: latitude 28.4773 and longitude -81.337. Right. Now, how to get the state? Geocoding API, hands down. Google Maps, Nominatim, something like that would be perfect. It's what they're built for. But, since I'm *simulating* this, let's play along. A quick check for a well-known spot at those coordinates would work too, or even a simple search engine query.

Alright, let's pretend I used a geocoding service and punched in "28.4773, -81.337". Boom! I know that points roughly to Orlando, Florida. Given the context, thatâ€™s practically a slam dunk. Orlando is in Florida. Excellent. I just need to give the answer in the requested format.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Florida
