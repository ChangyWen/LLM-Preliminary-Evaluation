Okay, the user needs the state for a given latitude and longitude. No problem. First, I need to get those coordinates to a location. That means using a geocoding service or tool; Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, or one of the dedicated APIs like Nominatim or the Google Geocoding API will do the trick.

Right, the coordinates are 27.9631, -80.6593. Wait... negative longitude...that's West of the Prime Meridian. Positive latitude...North of the Equator. Okay, so that's in the Western and Northern Hemispheres. I'll do a quick mental check. -80 longitude roughly puts me on the eastern US seaboard. And 27-28 latitude... that's pretty far south in the US.

Just to be absolutely sure, or if I need extreme precision, I'd plug those numbers, `27.9631, -80.6593`, into Google Maps or a similar service right now.

Okay, the geocoding result is near Melbourne, Florida...specifically, the Viera/Suntree area.

And the state isâ€¦

Florida
