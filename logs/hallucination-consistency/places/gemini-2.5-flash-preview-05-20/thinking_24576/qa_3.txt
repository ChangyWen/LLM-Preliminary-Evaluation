Okay, so the user wants to know the state, given some latitude and longitude coordinates. Let's see, the coordinates are 41.8375 and -87.6866. First, I quickly process those numbers. 41 North, 87 West - that's definitely somewhere in the US Midwest. To nail down the state, a geocoding service or a mapping tool would be the most precise, though I could likely figure this out without even needing to check. Thinking through this, I immediately get a mental picture: these coordinates are really close to Chicago, Illinois.

Let me just double check. 41.8375... thatâ€™s a bit south of the heart of downtown Chicago. And -87.6866, that looks to be near the United Center, on the west side. Yep, definitely Chicago. And Chicago is in Illinois, of course. Therefore, the answer is:

Illinois
