Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the state, given a latitude and longitude. Simple enough. Right away, I know I need reverse geocoding; I have coordinates, I want a place name.

Let's see... 33.6096 North and -117.6551 West. Hmm, that gives me a pretty quick mental picture. 33 degrees North... okay, Southern US, maybe North Africa or the Middle East, but with -117 West, that heavily biases towards the US. Specifically, the American Southwest.

Now, let me refine that. 33.6 is around the latitude of, say, Los Angeles or Phoenix or Dallas. But -117 is west of Phoenix. Ah, okay, so probably California. Using my knowledge base, I can place those coordinates – that’s right around Orange County, California, maybe Rancho Santa Margarita or Coto de Caza.

Right, I can answer that.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.

California
