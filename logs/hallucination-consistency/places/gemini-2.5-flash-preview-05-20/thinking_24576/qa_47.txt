Okay, let's see… the prompt is asking for the state. Straightforward enough, they want to know what state corresponds to a given set of coordinates.

First, I need to pull those coordinates out: Latitude 35.1087, Longitude -89.9663. Got it.

Right. My go-to for this kind of problem is absolutely a geocoding API. Google Maps, OpenStreetMap's Nominatim – something like that. No need to reinvent the wheel. If I was a regular human, I’d just chuck those coordinates into Google Maps.

Now, I'd simulate that API lookup. I’d take those coordinates – 35.1087, -89.9663 – and feed them into a service.

Next step, I'd interpret the returned data. This service will spit back a location. I’m betting it'll show me Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee, or something along those lines.

Alright, time to craft the answer. I need to identify the state, which is the specific piece of information the user is after.

Finally, format it properly. Let’s get this right.

Tennessee
