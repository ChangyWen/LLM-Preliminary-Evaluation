Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core task is crystal clear: determine the state from latitude and longitude coordinates. Easy enough. Now, let me quickly run through the basics, just to be sure. Latitude: that's the north-south position, positive for north, negative for south. Longitude: east-west, positive east of the Prime Meridian, negative west. Alright, with that locked in, let's look at the specifics.

Latitude is 29.4632. Definitely positive, meaning Northern Hemisphere. About 29 degrees North... that's probably somewhere in the southern United States, or maybe further south. Longitude is -98.5238. Negative, therefore West. And -98 degrees West puts us squarely in the continental US.

Now for the mental gymnastics â€“ or, more likely, a quick online check. I'd mentally frame the query: "latitude 29.4632 longitude -98.5238 state". Or maybe "what state is 29.4632, -98.5238 in?" Really, it's more instinct at this point than a calculated search. My internal map is pretty good, so a quick check would probably trigger the answer immediately: San Antonio, Texas.

Just to double-check, I'd confirm the coordinates of San Antonio. Yep, they're very close to the given ones. Right, final answer:

Texas
Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
