Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know the state associated with a given latitude and longitude. Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to remember how geo-coordinates work. Latitude is North/South, positive is North, negative is South. Okay, 41.4764 is North. Longitude is East/West, positive is East, negative is West. -81.6805 is West.

Now, how do I determine the state? I can try a few things. I can use my mental map of the US. 41 degrees North… that's roughly the northern half of the country. -81 degrees West is in the eastern half, but not extremely far east, so think more like the Ohio/Pennsylvania/Michigan region. Of course, that's just a rough estimate. The best way is to use a proper tool.

I could use Google Maps, or an online geocoding service. It's pretty easy to just drop those coordinates into a map. Let's use Google Maps for this. But wait... -81.6805 is very close to -81.7, and that’s a common longitude for Cleveland, Ohio. And 41.4764... that's also very close to Cleveland’s latitude!

Okay, so, the plan is: go to Google Maps, type in the coordinates "41.4764, -81.6805," and see what pops up.

*   *Go to Google Maps.*
*   *Type "41.4764, -81.6805" into the search bar.*
*   *The map centers on a location. Examine the surrounding area, or look at the address/place name that comes up.*

Yup, it's Cleveland, Ohio.

**The state is Ohio.**
