*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core task is crystal clear: determine the state based on provided latitude and longitude coordinates.

First, I've got to extract the crucial data points. Let's see... Latitude: 27.9945. Longitude: -82.4447.

Now, I need to quickly figure out the best approach. Let's do a mental check, a back-of-the-envelope calculation, if you will. Latitude 27-point-something screams "southern US" to me. Longitude -82-point-something... definitely in the eastern US, I think. The combination *strongly* points towards Florida, and probably somewhere around the Gulf Coast.

But I need to be precise, because I’m not guessing here. To absolutely nail it down, I'd normally whip out a geocoding API – something like Google Maps, or even the Nominatim API for OpenStreetMap. Alternatively, and quickly, I can visualize it in my head, or if I'm at a loss for the exactitude required, I'd bring up a map.

Okay, after cross-checking, mapping those coordinates (27.9945, -82.4447) takes me *directly* to the Tampa Bay area, and given my expertise I know immediately where that lies geographically.

So I can confidently confirm. The Tampa Bay area is absolutely in Florida.

Now, formulate the answer:

Florida
