Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know the U.S. state given a latitude and longitude. No problem. Let's break this down.

First, let's look at the numbers. The latitude is 40.0077, and the longitude is -75.1339. Right off the bat, I see positive latitude, so Northern Hemisphere, and negative longitude, so Western Hemisphere. Knowing those signs is crucial.

Now, I know my geography. -75 degrees longitude pretty much puts us on the East Coast. And 40 degrees latitude, well, that's roughly in the middle of the U.S., but on the East Coast, that places us in the Mid-Atlantic region.

To be absolutely sure, I'd quickly formulate a search query in my mind. Something like "latitude 40.0077 longitude -75.1339 location" or maybe "what state is 40.0077, -75.1339 in?". I could even just mentally picture a map!

The search, whether mental or real, would immediately bring Philadelphia to mind.

Philadelphia, of course, is in Pennsylvania.

So the answer is clear.

Pennsylvania
