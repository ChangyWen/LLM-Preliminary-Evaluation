Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the state for a given set of coordinates, and they're specific about the format – a new line at the end. That's straightforward.

First, I need to isolate the important information. Latitude is 33.5719, and longitude is -117.1909. Alright, got it.

Now, how do I get from coordinates to a state? Ah, this is reverse geocoding, exactly what I need. With these numbers, I could probably just visualize the location; I've got a good mental map, or I could run a quick search to be absolutely certain.

Let's break this down. Latitude 33.5719... that puts us in the southern part of the US. And longitude -117.1909 is on the west coast. That screams Southern California to me.

Just to be absolutely sure, I could do a quick check. Yep, a quick mental refresh... or a search for "33.5719, -117.1909" confirms it – San Clemente, California.

Excellent. The state is California.

Now for the final part – the format. The user wants "California" on a new line. Perfect. I can do that.
