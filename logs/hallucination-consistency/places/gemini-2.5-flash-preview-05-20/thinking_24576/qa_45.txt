Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The request is clear: I need to figure out which U.S. state corresponds to a specific latitude and longitude. So, the core task is a geographical lookup. Right away, I know this is a job for my geographic knowledge.

Let's see... I need to mentally translate those coordinates into a location. 36.1715 degrees North latitude puts us in the Northern Hemisphere, obviously. Then -86.7842 degrees West longitude means we're west of the Prime Meridian. That combination – positive latitude, negative longitude – tells me we're somewhere in North America, specifically in the continental United States.

Now for the more precise deduction. 36 degrees North puts us in the southern half of the US, approximately. And 86 degrees West? That's roughly in the eastern half, but not all the way over to the Atlantic coast. I know that the area spans several states and requires more specific calculations, but I have sufficient intuition to provide the answer. So, I'd immediately think of Tennessee. Even without a detailed map in front of me, I can picture the rough location on the US map in my head. A quick mental check, and I'm pretty confident.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.

Tennessee
