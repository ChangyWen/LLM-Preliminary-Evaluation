Okay, here's what I'm thinking, breaking down this geocoding problem:

First, what's the core of the question? The user is asking for the state associated with specific latitude and longitude coordinates. Easy enough.

Alright, I know this is a reverse geocoding problem. I need to find the corresponding geographic location from the provided coordinates. I'll have to execute a reverse geocoding procedure.

Let's look at the data: Latitude is 41.0798 and Longitude is -81.5219.

Now, I have a very good internal map of this area. Those coordinates immediately trigger a mental association. 41 degrees North and -81 degrees West – that's classic Midwestern/Northeastern US. Thinking about the location, it's very, very close to Akron, Ohio.

To be absolutely sure, I’d verify it using a map if I didn’t already know the answer. But given my recall, I’m confident with Akron, Ohio.

So, to directly answer the question: the requested information is the state. The state associated with those coordinates is Ohio.

Finally, the output should be the state.
