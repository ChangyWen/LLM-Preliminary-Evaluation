Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The task is straightforward: figure out the US state from a given lat/long pair. Alright, let me pull up those coordinates. 36.2333 north and -115.2654 west. Hmm, 36 north puts us somewhere in the lower half of the country, maybe even a little south, like Oklahoma, Tennessee, those areas. And the -115 west longitude... that's definitely out west, the Rockies or further west, Nevada, Arizona, Utah.

Right. Combining those, 36 north and -115 west... that's screaming Southwest. Okay, let me visualize. I have my mental map, or at least a rough idea. -115 longitude cuts through Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and very little of California. Thirty-six north latitude goes through California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and so on. The intersection... it's gotta be Nevada.

Just to be sure, always double check. Let's see, let me do a quick search of those coordinates. Ah, the search confirms it, near Indian Springs, Nevada. Yep, spot on. Okay. I'm ready.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.

Nevada
