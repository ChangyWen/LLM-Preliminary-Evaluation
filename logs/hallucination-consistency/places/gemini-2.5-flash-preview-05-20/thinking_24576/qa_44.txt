Okay, let's break this down. The user needs to know the U.S. state for a given latitude and longitude. Straightforward. My first thought is to use either a geocoding service or a mapping tool – that's the quickest and most reliable approach.

Now, let's get to the specifics. I have to work with these coordinates: 40.7776 latitude and -111.9311 longitude. I'll do a quick mental check first. 40 degrees north… that's roughly the latitude of places like Denver, Salt Lake City, or even New York. -111 degrees west, though... that's definitely out west. So, that narrows it down considerably.

To be absolutely certain, I'd *actually* use Google Maps, or maybe OpenStreetMap, or I'd hit a geocoding API if I needed this done programmatically. I type those coordinates into Google Maps. Instantaneously, it pops up: Salt Lake City.

Great. Now, extract the state information: clearly Utah.

I'm ready to formulate my answer, and I need to make sure I adhere to the requested format.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.

Utah
