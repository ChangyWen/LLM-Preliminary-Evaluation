Okay, let's see, the user wants to know the state corresponding to a specific latitude and longitude. Got it. First things first, I need to grab those coordinates: 35.4676 latitude and -97.5136 longitude. Now, how do I best get this information? Ah, the perfect tool for this is a reverse geocoding API. Something like the Google Maps Geocoding API or even OpenStreetMap's Nominatim would be ideal for this kind of lookup. Of course, if I'm pinched for time or don't have API access at the moment, I can probably get a good answer from my mental map, or even just a quick search.

Let me think... Okay, 35.4676 latitude... that puts us in the southern United States. And -97.5136 longitude... definitely in the central US, somewhere west of the Mississippi, but east of the Rockies. Right away, that narrows it down to states like Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, or maybe even Arkansas.

To be absolutely certain, let's just mentally double-check... or, better yet, I'll mentally query the coordinates: "35.4676, -97.5136". Yes, that's very close to Oklahoma City.

Therefore, the state is Oklahoma.

Final Answer: Oklahoma
