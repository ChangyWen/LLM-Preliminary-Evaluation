Okay, so the objective here is straightforward: figure out what U.S. state corresponds to a specific set of latitude and longitude coordinates. Seems simple enough. First things first, I need a reliable geocoding tool – something that can translate those raw coordinates into a usable location. The Google Maps API is always a solid choice, but OpenStreetMap's Nominatim is a good alternative if I want to keep things free and open-source. Even a quick lookup on a standard mapping site would do the trick in a pinch.

Alright, let's get those coordinates processed. The latitude is 38.1663, and the longitude is -85.6485. Now, before I even plug those in, a quick sanity check. 38 degrees North puts us somewhere in the middle latitudes of the States, and -85 degrees West… well, that’s definitely east of the Mississippi. Probably somewhere in the central or eastern part of the US. Okay, I'll perform the lookup. Let's see. Hmm, looks like we're dealing with a spot near Brandenburg, Kentucky. Got it.

Therefore, the answer is:

Kentucky
