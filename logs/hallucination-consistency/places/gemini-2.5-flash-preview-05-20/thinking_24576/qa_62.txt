Okay, here's the deal. The user wants the U.S. state for a set of coordinates. Simple enough. First, I need to remember the coordinate system. Latitude is north/south, with zero at the equator, positive for north, negative for south. Longitude is east/west, zero at the Prime Meridian, positive east, negative west. Got it.

Now, the given coordinates: 27.3387 North latitude and -82.5432 West longitude. Okay, so that latitude puts us somewhere in the southern U.S., likely. The longitude being negative means west, and -82 puts us firmly within the Eastern half of the U.S., maybe the southeast.

Hmm, let me think. 27 North and 82 West... Florida immediately jumps to mind. The latitude is about right, since Florida's southern tip is around 25 degrees north, and the West Coast is around 82-83 degrees west. Georgia is too far north, and Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi are too far west. Right, so it's going to be Florida, and specifically, this is somewhere on the Gulf coast, probably the Sarasota/Bradenton area.

Florida
