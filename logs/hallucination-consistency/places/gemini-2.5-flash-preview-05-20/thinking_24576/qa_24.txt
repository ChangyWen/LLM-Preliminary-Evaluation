Okay, let's see. The user wants to know the state associated with a specific latitude and longitude. Straightforward enough. First, I grab the numbers: 45.5371 for latitude, and -122.65 for longitude.

Now, let's get the lay of the land. 45.5 is definitely north, and -122.65 is well into the west. That places us somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, or nearby, in the continental US. My mind immediately jumps to Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and maybe Montana.

Hmm, -122 is close to the coast, so it's likely to be Washington or Oregon. And with 45 degrees latitude, we're looking at the Oregon-Washington border area, or maybe slightly south. Wait a minute... 45.5 and -122.65… those coordinates… that’s practically Portland, right?

I’m fairly confident, but let's just make sure. Just to be absolutely certain, I'd normally use my mental map or quickly type these coordinates into Google maps just to double-check. Yep.

So, the final answer is clear:

Oregon
