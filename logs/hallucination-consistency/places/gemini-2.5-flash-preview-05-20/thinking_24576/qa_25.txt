Okay, let's break this down. The task is to figure out the U.S. state from those lat/long coordinates. First, I need to understand the basics of latitude and longitude, which is second nature to me: latitude is north/south, longitude is east/west. Those values are positive/negative depending on their hemisphere, and I can tell right away that we're talking Northern and Western.

Now, let me zoom in on the specifics. I see roughly 34 degrees North and 117 degrees West. Immediately, the longitude screams "West Coast" to me. With the latitude, I can start narrowing it down. 34 North... that's definitely in the southern portion of the US. It's not quite as far south as Florida or Texas.

Now I combine them, making use of my mental map. Hmm, 34 North and 117 West... I begin to eliminate states. Washington, Oregon, Idaho, are too far north. Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, all too far east. Arizona is possible, but that longitude puts it more in Western Arizona or in California. Nevada is a possibility, though the latitude is a little bit south. Utah, again, is a maybe, but this is close to the Nevada border.

Putting it together: 34 North and 117 West *strongly* indicates Southern California, likely the Riverside, San Bernardino, or Los Angeles area.

Just to be sure – though I'm already pretty confident – if I had a quick way to check, I would. A mental check... Riverside, California... yes, that feels right.

Therefore, the answer is: California.
