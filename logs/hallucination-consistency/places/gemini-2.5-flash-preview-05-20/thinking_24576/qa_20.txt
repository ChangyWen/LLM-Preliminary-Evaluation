Okay, let's see. The user wants the state based on given latitude and longitude coordinates, and they want the answer formatted a specific way: final answer on a new line. Alright, straight forward reverse geocoding.

The latitude is positive, so we're in the Northern Hemisphere. Longitude is negative, placing us in the Western Hemisphere. Those coordinates are definitely in the US, and likely somewhere in the Northeast.

*40.7 N, -73.7 Wâ€¦*  Right away, my brain shouts "NYC!"  Need to be absolutely sure though, just a quick internal check or a quick online search if I needed to.  Yep, those pinpoint to the area around LaGuardia Airport, in Queens, New York City.

So, where is NYC? Ah, New York State, easy.

Time to formulate the answer.  Just the state name, and on a new line as instructed.

Let's double-check. Are those coordinates geographically sound? Check. Is the state correct? Absolutely, given the location. Formatting is correct too.

New York
