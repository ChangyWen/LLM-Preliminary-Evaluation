Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the state, given some coordinates. Easy enough, and they want it on its own line – got it.

First things first: 30.3005, -97.7522. Latitude/longitude coordinates. 30 degrees North…that's the southern US, definitely. And -97 degrees West... hmm, that's roughly the central part of the country, west of the Prime Meridian of course. This feels like Texas.

Now, normally, if I wasn’t immediately sure, or just wanted to be *absolutely* certain, I'd use my go-to tools: a mapping service like Google Maps or, even better for this, a geocoding API would be the perfect solution for a precise lookup. I'd feed those coordinates in, and it'd spit out the address, including the county, the city... all the details.

But I'm pretty confident right now. Still, I'll mentally map it: Austin, Travis County, Texas. Yup, that confirms it. 

Alright, the state is Texas.

So, here's the final, formatted answer, just like the user asked for:

Texas
