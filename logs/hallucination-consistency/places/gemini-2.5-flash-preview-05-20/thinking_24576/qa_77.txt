Okay, here's how I'd approach this. The core requirement is straightforward: figure out the U.S. state from a given set of latitude and longitude coordinates. I need to determine the state.

Now, let's think about the best way to do this. The obvious route is a geocoding service or some kind of mapping tool. I could use Google Maps - that's generally pretty fast and reliable. OpenStreetMap would work too, probably just as well. For a one-off like this, I wouldn't bother with something more elaborate, like a dedicated geocoding API; it'd be total overkill, even if I *do* have experience using them. A mental map? Well, that's not going to cut it for accuracy, unless I happened to know the exact location off the top of my head.

So, time to execute. I'd just plug those coordinates – 42.9619, -85.6562 – into Google Maps or my preferred mapping tool.

Then, I'd wait for the result. The map would center on the point, of course. The address information would pop up – street, city, state, zip, country… the whole shebang.

And now the analysis. I'd look for the *state* specifically, which is the specific piece of information needed. Based on a mental map of the approximate area, I'd expect the result to be near the Great Lakes.

Finally, the answer. I can state the final answer now.

The place with latitude 42.9619 and longitude -85.6562 is located in Michigan.
