Okay, let's see. The question is, essentially, "What state am I in given these coordinates?" Simple enough.

First, I need to remember what latitude and longitude actually *mean*. Latitude is north/south, right? Zero at the equator, plus 90 at the North Pole, minus 90 at the South Pole. Longitude is east/west, with the Prime Meridian as the zero point, going up to plus/minus 180 degrees. Got it.

Now, let's look at these numbers. Latitude is 35.9692 – positive, so we're in the Northern Hemisphere. And it's around 35 degrees north. That feels like a mid-latitude location, probably somewhere in the continental US. The longitude is -83.9496 – negative, so Western Hemisphere. Also within the US, and around 83 degrees West.

Okay, my strategy here is pretty straightforward: use my mental map of the US. I could easily use a mapping service or geocoding API, but I *think* I can do this from memory. Let's see... 35 North runs through a bunch of states – North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas… and 83 West runs through Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida…

Aha! The intersection of those two areas screams **Tennessee**. Specifically, Knoxville is right around those coordinates. Just a quick mental confirmation… Yep.

The state is Tennessee.

The final answer is: Tennessee.
