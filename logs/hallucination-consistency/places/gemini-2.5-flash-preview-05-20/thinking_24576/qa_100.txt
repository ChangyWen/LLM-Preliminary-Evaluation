Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to figure out the user's intent – they want to know the U.S. state for a specific lat/long pair. Simple enough. My go-to approach here is to use reverse geocoding. Either a readily available mapping tool or a dedicated service will be the quickest and most reliable way to nail this down.

Now, the coordinates. Let's see: 47.6671, -117.433. My mental processing starts immediately. Latitude 47-ish... that's quite far north in the U.S. Definitely not the south, California is out, and the Midwest is probably gone, as is most of the Northeast. We're looking at the northern tier. Now for longitude: -117. That puts us west of the Mississippi, and quite a ways west at that. Anything east of the Rockies is definitely out. It’s to the west of Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.

Putting it together, we've got a northern, western state. That's a pretty narrow range, really. Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, or maybe even North Dakota. Now, let's refine it a bit. -117 longitude... that’s roughly the longitude of eastern Washington/Oregon, western Idaho, or western Montana. And 47.6 latitude? That's pretty close to the latitude of Seattle, Spokane, and northern Idaho.

Right, time to check the precise location using the proper tools. I'll input those coordinates into a reverse geocoding tool – probably something like Google Maps, if I were actually doing this, or an API call if this were integrated into a larger system. I get the result...

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
