Okay, let's break this down. The user needs the state for a given lat/long. My immediate focus is on isolating the core task. I've got to identify the state based on those coordinates. Right, the lat/long is 40.5834, -74.1496. Now to figure out the best way to get the answer. Given the nature of the request, a geocoding service or even a quick look on a mapping tool is the logical choice. I mean, I *could* manually triangulate this, but why? Let's mentally zoom out to the US map... 40.x is definitely in the mid-latitudes. -74.x puts us on the East Coast. Hmm, right around the Northeast, potentially New Jersey or New York. I'd probably just pull up Google Maps or something and plug in the coordinates. A quick search, that's all I need. Oh, I bet that's Staten Island. Yep. And if I didn't know that, I'd verify. Staten Island... that's NYC... therefore, it's in New York State. Easy. Alright, the final answer needs to be formatted according to the prompt.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
