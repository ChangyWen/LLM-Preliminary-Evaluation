Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to figure out the state for a given lat/long. That's the core of it. Latitude and longitude... alright. Let's break it down.

39.762 North, that's essentially 40 degrees North. That places us right in the middle latitudes of the US – think mid-Atlantic, Midwest, or West Coast. Then we've got -104.8758 West, which is close to -105 West. Hmm, that's firmly in the western half, probably the Mountain West or maybe the High Plains.

Now, let's put the pieces together: roughly 40N and roughly 105W. 40 North gives us a range of possibilities: California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York. And 105 West narrows things down to: Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, western Texas, western Nebraska, and western Kansas.

The intersection of those two ranges... aha! Colorado jumps out. Seems like a pretty good bet. I’m pretty confident in that.

Just a quick mental check... Denver, Colorado, is around 39.7 North, 105 West, isn’t it? Yes, seems about right.

If I were being extra cautious, I'd probably plug those coordinates into Google Maps or a geocoding tool, just to be absolutely sure. But I'm pretty confident in this one.

Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response.
Colorado
