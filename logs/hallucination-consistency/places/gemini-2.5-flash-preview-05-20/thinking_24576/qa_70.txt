Okay, let's see. The user wants to know the state at a specific latitude and longitude. No problem. First things first, I know latitude tells me north/south. 34.0378 is definitely North, and the longitude, -80.9036, is West.

Hmm, 34 degrees North puts me in the southern US, and -80 degrees West is on the East Coast. That narrows it down quickly to states like Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and maybe even Florida's panhandle.

Now, -80.9 is *pretty* far west for Florida, but dead center for South Carolina and North Carolina. It's more eastern in Georgia. I immediately think of citiesâ€¦ Columbia, South Carolina, jumps out. Charlotte, NC, is nearby, a bit further north. And Augusta, GA, is to the south and west a little.

Just to be sure, I'd do a quick mental check, or if I'm feeling lazy, a quick "latitude 34.0378 longitude -80.9036" search. That should confirm it. Ah, yes, those coordinates land right around Columbia, South Carolina.

Alright, the answer: South Carolina. And, of course, a new line at the end, just to be sure. Done.
