Okay, let's break this down. The user is giving me a latitude and longitude and wants to know the corresponding U.S. state. Alright, that's straightforward. I'll need to figure out a way to geolocate those coordinates. I've got several options here - could use a geocoding API if this were a programmatic task, or I can mentally visualize it using my knowledge of geographic regions.

Let me seeâ€¦ the latitude, 33.7628, is in the southern part of the US, that's certain. And the longitude, -84.422, is definitely west of the prime meridian, which puts us in the eastern or southeastern part of the country. Putting those clues together, we're probably looking at somewhere in the Southeast. Now, let me see... aha! I know the Atlanta area, around 33.7 North, and 84.4 West. That's a pretty strong signal, but I always double-check these things.

To be absolutely sure, I'll do a quick mental check, or even a cursory search, because it's always good practice to confirm it. Yep, that location is right in Atlanta.

So, I have the answer, and now I need to present it clearly.

Georgia
