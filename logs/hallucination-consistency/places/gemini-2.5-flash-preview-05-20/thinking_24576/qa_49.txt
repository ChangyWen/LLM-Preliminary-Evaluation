Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core problem is pinpointing the U.S. state based on latitude and longitude. That's a classic geographical lookup, so I immediately think of geocoding or map services. I'll use my mental map and then check with a mapping tool.

Let's see, the coordinates are 37.5295 North and -77.4756 West. Thinking it through, 37.5 North is somewhere around the mid-Atlantic region, maybe a bit south, along the Mason-Dixon line. And -77.5 West is right on the East Coast, the mid-Atlantic again.

To confirm my estimate, I'll just quickly plug those coordinates into Google Maps. "37.5295, -77.4756"...ah, there it is! It lands directly on Richmond.

The answer, therefore, is:

Virginia
