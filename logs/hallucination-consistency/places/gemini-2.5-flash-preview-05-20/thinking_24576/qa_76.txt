Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to understand the core problem: the user is giving me latitude and longitude and wants the corresponding U.S. state, with the answer neatly placed on its own line at the end. Got it.

Now, I'll quickly start the mental process for a geo lookup, which is something I handle frequently. Time to figure out the state that these coordinates fall in.

Analyzing the numbers… Latitude is 41.2279, that's north, and fairly high up in the US. Longitude is -111.9682, which is west.

Now, I need to picture the U.S. and the states, right? Latitude 41 degrees goes through a bunch – California, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, and then further east, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and even some of the east coast states like New York, and Massachusetts.

The longitude -111 degrees is slicing through Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, and Arizona.

Let's intersect those possibilities in my mind… Looks like Wyoming and Utah are the common denominators.

Okay, time to be precise. -111.9682 is incredibly close to -112. Thinking through the borders, the western edge of Utah is roughly -114 degrees, the eastern is around -109. Northern border is around 42 degrees latitude and the southern border is roughly 37. These coordinates clearly hit within Utah's borders. It's specifically in the northern part of Utah, west of Salt Lake City.

So, the answer is… Utah.

Utah
