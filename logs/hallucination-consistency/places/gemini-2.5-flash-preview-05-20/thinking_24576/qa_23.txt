Okay, here we go. The user wants the state for a given latitude and longitude, and they want the answer neatly presented on its own line at the end. Right.

First, let's grab those coordinates. I see the latitude is 38.6359 and the longitude is -90.2451.

Now, let's see. 38.6359 North latitude... that puts us in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. And a longitude of -90.2451 West? That's definitely in the Western Hemisphere, probably somewhere in the central US.

Alright, let's do a quick mental calculation or maybe a lightning-fast online check, just to be sure. Yep... "38.6359, -90.2451"... bingo! St. Louis, Missouri.

So, is St. Louis *actually* in Missouri? Absolutely.

Now, let's present the answer the way they want it. Location first, then the state. And the state name needs its own line at the very end. Got it.

St. Louis

Missouri
