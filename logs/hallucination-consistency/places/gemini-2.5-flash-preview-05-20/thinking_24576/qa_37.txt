Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to understand the core task: the user needs the state associated with a given set of coordinates. Simple enough. Let's break this down.

Right, so the coordinates are: 39.9862 latitude and -82.9855 longitude. Now, what's the quickest and most reliable method for this? For something like this, a reverse geocoding API is perfect. Something like the Google Maps Geocoding API or OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API would be ideal, really. They're built for precisely this type of lookup.

But, since I'm simulating here and not actually *calling* an API, a good old-fashioned manual lookup will suffice. I could just punch those coordinates directly into a mapping service – Google Maps, Bing Maps, even OpenStreetMap – any of them would do the job.

Let's mentally perform the lookup. I'll plug those coordinates, 39.9862, -82.9855, into the map... Okay, the map shows... *Columbus, Ohio*.

Excellent. That answers the question. The state is readily apparent from the map's location information. The final step, of course, is to provide the answer, formatted and clearly labeled.

Ohio
