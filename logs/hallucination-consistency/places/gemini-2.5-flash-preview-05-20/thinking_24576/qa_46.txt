Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to figure out what this person wants, and it looks like they're asking for a state based on latitude and longitude. Easy enough. Alright, time to tap into my geospatial knowledge. Latitude is North/South, and since we're dealing with a positive latitude of 35.8324, that means we're in the Northern Hemisphere. As for the longitude, negative 78.6429 means we're West.

Now, let's do a quick mental calculation. 35 degrees North… that's roughly in the southern US, maybe the Carolinas, Tennessee, or maybe even Texas. Then I look at -78 West. Considering that it’s west of the Prime Meridian, and the longitude falls in the US, that really hones in on the East Coast.

Putting those together… 35 North and -78 West, that screams the Southeast. Specifically, this points to the Carolinas or Virginia. Okay, I should probably just confirm, a quick search would be: "latitude 35.8324 longitude -78.6429 state" or something similar, you know, to make sure. I could use a map, but I'm pretty sure I'm right. Yep, that's North Carolina. I know the general area, and it is near Raleigh.

So, the answer is clear.

As requested by the prompt: North Carolina.
