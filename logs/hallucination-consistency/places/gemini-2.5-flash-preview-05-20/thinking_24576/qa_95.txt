Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a simple geographical problem solved: they want to know the U.S. state based on a latitude and longitude. Easy enough. First, I need to remember what tools I have to solve this. This is a geocoordinate lookup - I need to translate coordinates to a state.

Now, let's get into the specifics. I've got the lat/long: 39.5497 and -119.8483. Okay, let's break this down. Positive latitude means North, negative longitude means West. I'll start with a rough estimate. 39.5 North puts me somewhere in the middle of the U.S., maybe the Northeast, Midwest, or West. But -119.8 West... that's a big clue. That's definitely West Coast or intermountain west. Eliminates pretty much everything east of the Rockies.

So, putting it together, 39.5 North and -119.8 West... That *sounds* like it's in Nevada, maybe California, perhaps Utah. I know Reno is in this general area, right? Let me quickly double-check my memory or use a quick search for those coordinates, just to be sure. 

Yep. Okay, confirmed: the coordinates point to Reno, Nevada. Therefore the answer is Nevada.
