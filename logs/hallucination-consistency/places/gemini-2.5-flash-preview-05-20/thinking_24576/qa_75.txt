Okay, here's my thought process. First, I need to zero in on the user's actual need: they want to know the state corresponding to a given latitude and longitude. Got it. Now, let's see those coordinates. Alright, latitude is 30.442, and longitude is -91.1311.

Now, the quickest, most direct approach to this is obvious: I need to leverage geocoding. That means either using a web search, a mapping service's interface, or a dedicated API call, any of which will let me map those coordinates to a location. Let's mentally execute this. I'll just... *look it up*. Okay, let's say I'm using Google Maps internally here.

The results...Ah, the location is pinpointing to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Therefore, the state is Louisiana.

Now, about formatting the response. "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." Hmm...I need to phrase it correctly to be clear and also comply with this instruction. I need to give a full response and then the answer.

The place with latitude 30.442 and longitude -91.1311 is located in the state of Louisiana.

Louisiana
