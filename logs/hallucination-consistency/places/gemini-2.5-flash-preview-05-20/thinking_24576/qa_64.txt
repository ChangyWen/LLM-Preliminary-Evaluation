Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core of the problem is straightforward: I need to figure out the US state given a specific latitude and longitude coordinate.

First, let's break down the coordinates themselves. Latitude is North/South, and positive is North, so 36.1283 is definitely North, in the Northern Hemisphere. Longitude is East/West. -95.9042 is negative, placing it West of the Prime Meridian.

Now, how do I get the state? I could go right to a geocoding service or a map tool, that's the most efficient way. But, for the sake of thinking through this... I could also make a rough mental approximation. -95.9 longitude puts us somewhere central in the US. 36.1 latitude says we're somewhere South, but not super South. Definitely north of the Florida/Gulf Coast which is roughly around 30 degrees. It's also south of, say, the Midwest or Northern Plains states, which get up towards 40 degrees latitude.

If I were actually *doing* this, I'd just plug "36.1283, -95.9042" into Google Maps, or another tool.

The answer that's returned, without a doubt, is Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Therefore:

Oklahoma
