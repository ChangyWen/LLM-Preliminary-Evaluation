Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know the state corresponding to these coordinates. Alright, easy enough. First, I've got to recall my geographic knowledge. Latitude, that's North/South. Positive is North, negative is South. 33.5279 is definitely North, and -86.7971 is West. Got it.

Now, let's get a general sense of where we are. Those coordinates... they *feel* like North America. Probably the contiguous US, given those numbers. Hmmm, how to find the state...

I could try to mentally estimate. Latitude is around 33-34 North. That puts us in the southern US. Okay, think of southern states: Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, maybe Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, South Carolina, North Carolina, Arkansas... Now, longitude is -86 to -87 West. That's relatively far east, when you think about it, in the Western Hemisphere. Combining those... Southern US, relatively eastern. Hmm, Alabama or Georgia seem most likely. But -86.7971... that's close to -87, and west of -86. So, that strengthens my belief: Alabama, likely near the Georgia border, but definitely in Alabama.

But I need to be precise, and the mental map method isn't perfect. Best to use a lookup. I'll choose the reliable route – a geocoding service or a map tool. The standard is Google Maps. I'll just input the coordinates and see what it gives me. In my mind, I'm already searching, entering "33.5279, -86.7971".

Okay, simulating the result... *click*... and the map shows… Birmingham, Alabama. Exactly what I expected!

Therefore, the answer is:

Alabama
