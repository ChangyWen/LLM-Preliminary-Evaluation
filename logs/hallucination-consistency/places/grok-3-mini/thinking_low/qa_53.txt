*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 30.0687 and longitude -89.9288 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 30.0687° N (since it's positive)

Longitude: -89.9288° (which means 89.9288° W)

So, this is in the northern hemisphere, west of the Prime Meridian.

To find the state, I should recall or look up which US state this falls into. I know that latitudes around 30° N are in the southern US, and longitudes around 90° W are in the central or eastern US.

Let me think about major cities or known locations:

- New Orleans, Louisiana, is around 29.9511° N, 90.0715° W.

That's close but not exact. 30.0687° N and -89.9288° W.

-89.9288° W is east of -90.0715° W, since -89.9288 is greater than -90.0715 (less negative means east).

Longitudes: -89.9288° W is approximately 89.93° W, and New Orleans is at 90.07° W, so yes, slightly east.

Perhaps it's in Mississippi or Alabama.

I can use my knowledge of state boundaries.

The coordinates are roughly 30.07° N, 89.93° W.

This is in the Gulf Coast region.

Let me recall:

- Louisiana is west of Mississippi.

The Mississippi River is around 90° W.

More precisely:

- The border between Louisiana and Mississippi is along the Pearl River and then the state line.

I think 30.0687 N, -89.9288 W is in Mississippi.

Let me double-check with known points.

Biloxi, Mississippi, is approximately 30.3960° N, 88.8852° W.

That's 30.3960 N, 88.8852 W, which is further north and east than my coordinates.

My coordinates: 30.0687 N, -89.9288 W (so 89.9288 W).

Biloxi is 30.3960 N, 88.8852 W (88.8852 W is east of 89.9288 W).

Longitude: -88.8852 is west of -89.9288 because -88.8852 > -89.9288 (less negative).

Numerically, -88.8852 is greater than -89.9288, so -88.8852 W is east of -89.9288 W.

Longitudes increase as you go east in the western hemisphere.

Standard: Longitudes west are negative, so -90 is further west than -89.

So, -89.9288 W is east of -90 W, and Biloxi at -88.8852 W is even further east.

Perhaps I need to plot this.

I know that the city of Gulfport, Mississippi, is around 30.3673 N, 89.0129 W.

30.3673 N, 89.0129 W.

My coordinates: 30.0687 N, 89.9288 W.

So, 30.0687 N is south of 30.3673 N, and 89.9288 W is west of 89.0129 W (since 89.9288 > 89.0129, so -89.9288 is more negative, thus further west).

This is getting confusing. Let's clarify:

For longitudes in the US:

- Smaller number (more negative) is further west.

So, -89.9288 W is west of -89.0129 W.

For example, -90 W is west of -89 W.

So, my coordinates: latitude 30.0687 N (south of Gulfport's 30.3673 N), and longitude -89.9288 W (west of Gulfport's -89.0129 W).

Gulfport is at -89.0129 W, which is east of -89.9288 W.

Perhaps the coordinates are for a place like Pass Christian or something in Mississippi.

I can think of New Orleans at 29.95 N, 90.07 W.

So, 30.0687 N is north of New Orleans, and -89.9288 W is east of -90.07 W.

So, that would be northeast of New Orleans, which is in Mississippi.

Yes, the area around 30 N, 90 W is the Mississippi-Louisiana border.

Specifically, let's estimate: the state line between Louisiana and Mississippi is at approximately 89.5 W or something? No.

The Mississippi River is at about 90 W, and Mississippi state is east of that.

The western border of Mississippi is the Mississippi River, which is around 90 W for New Orleans area.

So, for latitude 30.0687 N, which is north of New Orleans, the longitude -89.9288 W is east of the river, so in Mississippi.

For example, the town of Slidell, Louisiana, is at about 30.279 N, 89.781 W, which is in Louisiana, east of the river.

Slidell is in Louisiana, and it's at 30.279 N, 89.781 W.

My coordinates: 30.0687 N, 89.9288 W.

So, 30.0687 N is south of Slidell's 30.279 N, and 89.9288 W is west of 89.781 W (since -89.9288 is more negative than -89.781).

So, west of Slidell.

Slidell is in Louisiana, and west of Slidell would still be in Louisiana, as Louisiana extends west from there.

This is tricky. Let's think carefully.

The state of Louisiana is west of the Mississippi River, but for the northern part, the border is the Pearl River or straight lines.

Upon second thought, the coordinates 30.0687 N, -89.9288 W are likely in Louisiana.

Let me try to look for a exact match or close one.

I recall that the NASA Stennis Space Center is in Mississippi, near the border, at around 30.35 N, 89.6 W or something.

Perhaps it's easier to use a mental map or recall that 30.0687 N, -89.9288 W is very close to the town of Pearlington, Mississippi, or perhaps in Louisiana.

After thinking, I believe 30.0687 N, -89.9288 W is in Mississippi.

Let's confirm with a different approach. I can think of the city of Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, which is at approximately 30.3086 N, 89.2845 W.

That's north and east.

Perhaps the coordinates are for a place like Waveland, Mississippi.

Upon double-checking, I think the exact coordinates 30.0687 N, -89.9288 W are for the town of Pearlington, which is in Hancock County, Mississippi.

Yes, I believe that's correct.

So, the state is Mississippi.

Therefore, the final answer is Mississippi.
