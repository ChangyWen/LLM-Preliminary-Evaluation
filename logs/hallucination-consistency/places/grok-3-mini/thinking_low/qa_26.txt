*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked about the state for the coordinates: latitude 28.4773 and longitude -81.337.

I need to recall what these coordinates represent. Latitude and longitude pinpoint a location on Earth. Latitude 28.4773 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -81.337 is in the Western Hemisphere.

To find the state, I should think about which US state this falls into. The US has states in various latitudes and longitudes.

Latitude around 28 degrees North is in the southern part of the US. For example, Florida is around there. Miami is about 25.76 N, and Orlando is around 28.54 N. Let me double-check that.

Actually, Orlando, Florida, is approximately at 28.5383 N latitude and -81.3792 W longitude. That sounds very close.

The given coordinates are 28.4773 N and -81.337 W. That's very near to Orlando's coordinates.

So, this is likely in Florida.

To be precise, I should confirm if this exact point is in Florida. Florida extends from about 24.5 N to 31 N, and longitudes from about -80 W to -87 W.

-81.337 is within that range.

Is there any other state that could have these coordinates? No, because latitude 28 N is too far south for other states except perhaps southern Texas, but Texas is around 26-36 N, and its eastern longitudes are around -93 to -97, which is west of -81.

Longitude -81 is on the east coast. So, definitely Florida.

I can think of nearby cities. Latitude 28.4773 and -81.337 is probably in the Orlando area, which is in Orange County, Florida.

Therefore, the state is Florida.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, my response should end with something like:

Final Answer

Florida

Make sure it's on a new line.
