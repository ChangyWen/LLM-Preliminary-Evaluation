*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 42.2705 and longitude -71.8079 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 42.2705° N (positive means North)

Longitude: -71.8079° (negative means West)

So, this is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States has various states with coordinates in this range. Let me recall:

- Latitude around 42° N is in the northeastern part of the US.

- Longitude around -71° W is also in the northeast, possibly New England area.

Specific states:

- Massachusetts is around there. Boston, for example, is at approximately 42.3601° N, -71.0589° W.

Let me verify if 42.2705° N, -71.8079° W is in Massachusetts.

I can think of nearby cities. Worcester, Massachusetts, is a city in that area. Let me check if these coordinates match Worcester.

Upon my knowledge, Worcester, MA is approximately at 42.2626° N, -71.8029° W. That's very close to 42.2705° N, -71.8079° W.

So, yes, this is likely in Worcester, Massachusetts.

Therefore, the state is Massachusetts.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this exact point is indeed in Massachusetts and not bordering another state.

Massachusetts borders New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, but at this latitude and longitude, it's firmly in Massachusetts.

The coordinates are:

- Latitude 42.2705 is between 42° N (which is the southern border of some states) and it's north of New York City (around 40° N).

- Longitude -71.8079 is east of the Mississippi, in the East Coast.

Specifically, plotting it mentally: From New York, going north and a bit west, but -71° is east of -74° (NYC), so it's further east, into Massachusetts.

Yes, confirmed.

So, the state is Massachusetts.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

My response should be clear and direct, then end with the answer on a new line.
