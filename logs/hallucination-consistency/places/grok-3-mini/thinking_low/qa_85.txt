*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 27.9631 and longitude -80.6593 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 27.9631° N (since it's positive)

Longitude: -80.6593° (which means 80.6593° W)

So, this is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

To find the state, I should recall or look up which US state this falls into. I know that latitudes around 27° N are in the southern parts of the US, like Florida.

Let me think about Florida's coordinates. Florida's northernmost point is around 31° N, and southernmost is about 24° N. So, 27.9631° N is definitely in Florida.

For longitude, Florida's east coast is around 80° W. Miami is about 80.2° W, and this is -80.6593°, which is roughly 80.66° W.

I can pinpoint this. The coordinates 27.9631 N, 80.6593 W sound like they're in Florida. Let me verify if this is exact.

I recall that Vero Beach or nearby areas in Florida have coordinates around there. Specifically, looking it up in my knowledge, 27.9631 N, 80.6593 W is approximately the location of Vero Beach, Florida.

Vero Beach is in Indian River County, Florida.

So, the state is Florida.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this could be in another state. For example, is there any part of another state at this latitude and longitude? No, because at 27° N and 80° W, it's squarely in Florida. Texas is further west, around 95-100° W, and Louisiana is around 90-95° W. So, definitely Florida.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "The coordinates 27.9631 latitude and -80.6593 longitude are located in the state of Florida."

Then, end with the final answer on a new line.

Final answer: Florida

Make sure it's just the state name, as per the question.

The question says: "What state does the place with latitude 27.9631 and longitude -80.6593 located in?"

So, directly, the state is Florida.
