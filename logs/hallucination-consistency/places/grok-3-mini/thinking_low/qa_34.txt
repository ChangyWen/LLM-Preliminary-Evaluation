*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 39.7771 and longitude -86.1458 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 39.7771 N (positive means North)

Longitude: -86.1458 (negative means West)

So, this is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States has various states with coordinates in this range. Let me think about where this might be.

I recall that Indianapolis, Indiana, is around there. Let me verify:

- Indianapolis is in Indiana.

- Approximate coordinates for Indianapolis: I think it's about 39.77° N and 86.16° W, which matches closely with 39.7771 N and 86.1458 W.

Yes, that sounds right. So, this should be in Indiana.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this exact point is indeed in Indiana and not on a border.

Indiana is bordered by Michigan to the north, Ohio to the east, Kentucky to the south, and Illinois to the west. The coordinates given are well within Indiana's boundaries.

For example:

- Latitude 39.7771 is around the central part of Indiana.

- Longitude -86.1458 is also central.

No major borders cross this point, so it's definitely in Indiana.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief explanation and then end with the answer.

Final answer: Indiana

Make sure it's just the state name, as specified.
