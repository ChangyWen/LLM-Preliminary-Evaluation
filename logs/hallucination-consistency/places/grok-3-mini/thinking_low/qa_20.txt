*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked about the location with latitude 40.7498 and longitude -73.7976. I need to determine what state this place is in.

Latitude and longitude are coordinates. Latitude 40.7498 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -73.7976 is in the western hemisphere, which points to North America, specifically the United States.

I recall that New York City is around latitude 40.7 and longitude -74.0. Let me double-check that. Actually, the Empire State Building in NYC is approximately at 40.7484° N, 73.9857° W. That doesn't match exactly.

The given coordinates are 40.7498 N and -73.7976 W. Let me think: -73.7976 is west, so 73.7976° W.

I know that Manhattan, New York, has coordinates around there. For example, Central Park is about 40.785° N, 73.968° W. That might be close.

Let me try to pinpoint it more accurately. I can think about famous places. Latitude 40.7498 and longitude -73.7976 sounds very close to the coordinates of the Flatiron Building or something in NYC.

Upon second thought, I believe 40.7498 N, 73.7976 W is in Queens, New York. Let me verify mentally.

Actually, looking it up in my knowledge: The coordinates for LaGuardia Airport in Queens, NY, are approximately 40.777° N, 73.874° W. That's not exact.

Perhaps it's for a specific point. I can use the fact that New York City is in New York State.

To be precise, let's assume I have access to a map or recall that this is within the boundaries of New York State.

Latitude 40.7498 is roughly the same as New York City, which is in New York State.

Longitude -73.7976: New York City spans from about -73.7 to -74.0 or so.

Actually, upon reflection, I think 40.7498 N, -73.7976 W is in the Bronx or perhaps Queens.

Let me think differently. I can calculate roughly: New York City's central coordinates are around 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W for Times Square.

-73.7976 is east of that, since -73.7976 is greater than -74.0060 (more west means more negative).

Longitude increases westward, so -74.0060 is further west than -73.7976.

-73.7976 is east of -74.0060 because -73.7976 is less negative.

So, for example, Long Island is further east, around -73.something.

Yes, exactly. Places like Flushing in Queens are around 40.76° N, 73.83° W.

Let me confirm: Upon thinking, I believe 40.7498 N, -73.7976 W is very close to the coordinates of Citi Field or something in Queens, which is in New York State.

To be accurate, I can state that this latitude and longitude fall within New York State.

Is there any chance it's in another state? Latitude 40.7 is also for Pennsylvania or New Jersey, but longitude -73.7 is specifically for New York.

For example, New Jersey is around -74.5, and Pennsylvania is further west.

So, yes, -73.7976 W with 40.7498 N is definitely in New York State, likely in New York City, specifically in Queens or the Bronx.

Therefore, the state is New York.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should end with something like:

New York

On a new line.

I should make sure my response is helpful and not just the answer. Perhaps explain briefly.

Final structure:

- Acknowledge the query.

- State the location briefly.

- Give the answer.
