*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked about the state for the coordinates: latitude 39.9862 and longitude -82.9855.

I need to recall or know where these coordinates are. Latitude 39.9862 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -82.9855 is in the western hemisphere, specifically in the US.

Let me think about US states. Latitude around 40 is roughly the Ohio-Pennsylvania area. Longitude around -83 is central US, like Ohio or Indiana.

I believe these coordinates are for Columbus, Ohio. Let me double-check: Columbus, Ohio, is approximately at 39.9612° N, 82.9988° W. That's very close to 39.9862 N and -82.9855 W.

So, yes, that's in Ohio.

To be precise, I should confirm if it's exactly in Ohio or near the border. Ohio's borders: to the north is Michigan and Lake Erie, south is Kentucky, east is Pennsylvania, west is Indiana.

Given the coordinates, it's well within Ohio.

The user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. Maybe start with a brief explanation and then give the answer.

Final answer: Ohio

Make sure it's just the state name, as per the question.

The question says: "What state does the place with latitude 39.9862 and longitude -82.9855 located in?"

So, response structure:

- Perhaps a short sentence confirming.

- Then, on a new line, the answer.
