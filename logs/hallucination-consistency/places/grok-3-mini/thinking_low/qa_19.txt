First, the user asked about the state for a location with latitude 39.762 and longitude -104.8758. I need to determine which US state this corresponds to.

Latitude 39.762 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -104.8758 is in the western hemisphere, which points to the United States.

I recall that Denver, Colorado, is around that area. Let me verify the coordinates for Denver. From my knowledge, Denver's approximate coordinates are 39.739° N, 104.990° W, which is very close to 39.762 N, 104.8758 W.

So, this is likely in Colorado.

To be precise, I should confirm if this exact point is within Colorado's borders. Colorado is bordered by Wyoming to the north, Nebraska to the northeast, Kansas to the east, Oklahoma to the southeast, New Mexico to the south, Utah to the west, and Arizona to the southwest.

Given the longitude is about -104.8758, which is around the central part of the US, and latitude 39.762 is in the central northern area, it should be in Colorado.

I can think about nearby states: To the east is Kansas, which starts around longitude -102, but more precisely, the border between Colorado and Kansas is at about longitude -102.041. Wait, no, let's correct that.

Actually, Colorado's eastern border is along the 102nd meridian west, but Denver is further west. Denver is at about -105 longitude, wait no:

Longitude -104.8758 is west of the 100th meridian. The 100th meridian is around -100, so -104 is further west.

Specifically, Colorado spans from about -102 to -109 longitude.

Denver is in Colorado, and its coordinates match, so it's safe.

If I were to be thorough, I could consider if it's near any borders. For example, is it close to Wyoming? Wyoming is north of Colorado, and its southern border is at about 41° N, while 39.762 is south of that.

Colorado's northern border is around 41° N with Wyoming, but Denver is at 39.7, which is well within Colorado.

So, no doubt, it's in Colorado.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

My response should be something like: [Explanation] and then on a new line: Colorado

Keep it concise.
