*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 33.5279 and longitude -86.7971 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 33.5279 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -86.7971 is in the western hemisphere, which means it's in the United States.

To pinpoint the exact location, I should recall or look up what city or area these coordinates correspond to. From my knowledge, latitude 33.5279 and longitude -86.7971 are the coordinates for Birmingham, Alabama.

Let me double-check that. Birmingham, Alabama, is indeed around that area. Yes, according to standard geographic data, Birmingham's coordinates are approximately 33.5279° N, 86.7971° W.

So, Birmingham is in the state of Alabama.

The user asked for the state, not the city. Therefore, the answer should be Alabama.

Finally, the instructions say to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

Response structure:
- I can provide a brief explanation.
- End with the final answer on a new line.
