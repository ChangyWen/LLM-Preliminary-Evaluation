*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 35.3529 and longitude -119.0359 is located. I need to determine which US state that corresponds to.

Latitude 35.3529 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -119.0359 is in the western hemisphere, which points to the United States.

To find the exact location, I should recall or look up what city or area this is near. I know that:

- Latitude around 35 degrees is roughly in the southern part of the US.

- Longitude around -119 is in California, as California's longitudes range from about -114 to -124.

Let me confirm: Los Angeles is around 34°N and 118°W, which is latitude 34 and longitude -118. So, 35.3529 N and -119.0359 W is very close to that.

This sounds like Bakersfield, California. I believe Bakersfield is at approximately 35.3733° N, 119.0187° W. Let me double-check that.

Upon thinking, yes, that's correct. So, latitude 35.3529 and longitude -119.0359 is in Bakersfield, which is in California.

Therefore, the state is California.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and clear. I can say something like: "Based on the coordinates provided, latitude 35.3529 and longitude -119.0359, this location is in the state of California."

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

Response structure:

- Start with a brief explanation.

- End with the final answer on a new line.
