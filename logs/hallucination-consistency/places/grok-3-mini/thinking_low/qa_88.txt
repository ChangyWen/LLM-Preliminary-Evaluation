*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked about the state for the coordinates: latitude 33.4015 and longitude -111.7178.

I need to recall how to determine the location from latitude and longitude. Latitude is 33.4015, which is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude is -111.7178, which is in the western hemisphere.

To find the state, I should think about which US state this falls into. The US is in the western hemisphere, so that matches.

Let me visualize or recall the approximate locations:

- Latitude around 33 degrees North is roughly in the southern US. For example, southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, etc.

- Longitude around -111 degrees West: That's in the mountain time zone area. For reference:

  - New York is around -74 longitude.

  - Denver is around -105.

  - Los Angeles is around -118.

  So, -111 is between -105 and -118, which puts it in the southwestern US, likely Arizona or maybe New Mexico.

More precisely:

- Arizona's longitudes range from about -109 to -114.

I think Phoenix, Arizona, is around there. Let me confirm my knowledge: Phoenix is at approximately 33.45 N latitude and -112.07 W longitude.

The given coordinates are 33.4015 N and -111.7178 W.

That sounds very close to Phoenix. Let me double-check:

Upon thinking, yes, Phoenix, Arizona, is at about 33.4484 N, -112.0740 W. Wait, that's not exact, but close.

The given is 33.4015 and -111.7178. Let me see if that's exact.

I believe 33.4015 N and -111.7178 W is actually for Mesa, Arizona, which is near Phoenix.

Mesa is a city in Arizona, part of the Phoenix metropolitan area.

So, based on that, it should be in Arizona.

To be thorough, let's ensure there are no other states nearby. For example, is this in Nevada? No, Nevada is further west, around -114 to -120 longitude.

- California is west of -114 or so.

- Arizona is between -109 and -114.

More accurately:

- The border: Arizona's western border is with California at around -114.5 longitude.

Longitude lines run north-south, so for latitude 33.4, which is in the south.

At latitude 33.4 N:

- From west to east: Pacific Ocean, California (up to about -114), then Arizona (-114 to -109), then New Mexico (-109 to -103), etc.

So, -111.7178 is within Arizona's longitude range.

Specifically, Phoenix area is around -112, so -111.7 is a bit east of Phoenix, which is still in Arizona, likely in the suburbs or nearby cities.

I can confirm that these coordinates are for a place in Arizona.

Upon quick mental search, I recall that the coordinates 33.4015, -111.7178 are for Apache Junction or something near Mesa, but definitely in Arizona.

So, the state is Arizona.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

My response should be something like: [Explanation] and then on a new line: Arizona

Keep it concise.
