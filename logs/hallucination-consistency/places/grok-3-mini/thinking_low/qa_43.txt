*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 30.3322 and longitude -81.6749 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 30.3322 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -81.6749 is in the western hemisphere. This places it in the United States.

To pinpoint the exact location, I should recall or know that these coordinates correspond to Jacksonville, Florida. Let me verify that mentally:

- Jacksonville, Florida, has approximate coordinates of 30.3322° N, 81.6749° W. Yes, that matches.

Florida is a state in the southeastern United States. So, the place is in Florida.

I should confirm if this is precisely in Florida and not near a border. Latitude 30.3322 is around the level of northern Florida, and longitude -81.6749 is on the east coast, which aligns with Florida's position.

To be thorough, I can think about nearby states: Georgia is to the north, but Jacksonville is definitely in Florida. The border with Georgia is further north, around 30.7° N or so.

Finally, the user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

Response structure:
- I can start with a brief explanation.
- End with the answer on a new line.

Final answer: Florida
