*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 35.1087 and longitude -89.9663 is located. I need to determine which US state this corresponds to.

Latitude is 35.1087 North, and longitude is -89.9663 West. This is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

To find the state, I should recall the approximate latitudes and longitudes of US states.

- The southern US has latitudes around 25-35 degrees North.

- Longitude -90 is roughly the Mississippi River.

Specifically:

- Latitude 35 is around the level of Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, etc.

- Longitude -90 is the Mississippi River, which runs through states like Tennessee, Mississippi, etc.

Let me pinpoint this:

- Memphis, Tennessee, is around 35.1495° N, 90.0489° W. That's close to 35.1087 N and -89.9663 W.

Comparing:

- Given: 35.1087 N, -89.9663 W

- Memphis: Approximately 35.1046 N, 89.9770 W (I think I have the exact coords wrong, but it's close).

Upon double-checking my knowledge:

Actual Memphis, TN coordinates are about 35.1046° N, 90.0489° W. Wait, no:

I believe Memphis is at 35.1495° N, 90.0489° W. Let me correct that.

Standard coordinates for Memphis, TN: 35.1046° N, 89.9770° W? Wait, I need to be accurate.

From memory: Memphis is indeed around 35.1° N and 90° W.

More precisely, looking it up in my mind: 35.1087 N and -89.9663 W is very close to Memphis.

In fact, I think that's exactly or very near to Memphis, Tennessee.

So, this location is in Tennessee.

To confirm without external tools:

- Latitude 35.1 is in the southeastern US.

- Longitude -90 is the Mississippi River area.

States around there: Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas.

Specifically, west of the Mississippi River is Arkansas and Louisiana, but -89.9663 is east of -90, so it's on the east side of the Mississippi.

Longitude decreases as you go west, so -89.9663 is east of -90.

-90 is further west than -89.9663.

Longitude: -89.9663 is approximately 90 degrees west, but slightly east of exactly 90.

The Mississippi River at Memphis is around -90.

Memphis is on the east bank of the Mississippi, so its longitude is around -90.

Upon second thought, Memphis, TN is at about 35.1 N, 90.0 W, which is -90.0.

But the given is -89.9663, which is very close, perhaps a slight variation.

I can think of it as being in Tennessee.

To be thorough, let's consider the boundaries:

- Tennessee's western border is the Mississippi River, around longitude -90.

- So, points with longitude around -89.9 to -90 are in Tennessee.

Yes, so this should be in Tennessee.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should end with something like:

Tennessee

On a new line.
