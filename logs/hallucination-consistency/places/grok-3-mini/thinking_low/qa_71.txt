*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 37.9722 and longitude -122.0016 is located. I need to determine which US state this corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are coordinates. Latitude 37.9722 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -122.0016 is west of the Prime Meridian.

To find the state, I should recall or look up where these coordinates point to. I know that:

- Latitude around 37-38 degrees north is in California, for example, San Francisco is about 37.7749° N, 122.4194° W.

Let me compare:

- Given: 37.9722° N, -122.0016° W

- San Francisco: 37.7749° N, 122.4194° W

That's close but not exact. 37.9722 is a bit north of San Francisco, and -122.0016 is east of San Francisco since it's less negative (westward).

Longitude: -122.0016 is east of -122.4194 because -122.0016 is greater than -122.4194 (less westward).

So, perhaps it's in the East Bay area of California.

I can think of major cities:

- Oakland is around 37.8044° N, 122.2711° W

- Berkeley is about 37.8715° N, 122.2730° W

37.9722° N is higher than Berkeley's 37.8715°, so further north.

Perhaps it's in Contra Costa County or something like that.

I know that the coordinates are in California. Let me confirm the boundaries.

California's latitude ranges from about 32° N to 42° N, and longitude from about -114° W to -124° W.

Specifically, -122° W is definitely in California.

To be precise, let's pinpoint it.

I recall that Walnut Creek or other areas in the Bay Area might match.

Upon second thought, latitude 37.9722 and longitude -122.0016 sounds like it's near or in Martinez, California, which is in Contra Costa County.

But to confirm, I should rely on my knowledge that this is in California.

Is there any chance it's in another state? For example, Nevada is east of California, so longitude would be more negative, like -114 to -120.

Longitude -122 is west, so California.

Oregon is north, around 42-46° N, so 37° is south of that.

So, definitely California.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should end with the state name on a new line.

Final answer: California

I should make sure. Is there any ambiguity? For example, if it's exactly on the border, but no, these coordinates are clearly in California.
