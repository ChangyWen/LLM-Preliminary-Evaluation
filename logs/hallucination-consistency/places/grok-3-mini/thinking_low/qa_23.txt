First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 38.6359 and longitude -90.2451 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 38.6359 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -90.2451 is in the Western Hemisphere. This points to the United States.

I recall that the coordinates 38.6359° N, 90.2451° W are for St. Louis, Missouri. Let me double-check that. Yes, St. Louis is around there. The exact coordinates for St. Louis are approximately 38.6270° N, 90.1994° W, but the given ones are close: 38.6359 N, 90.2451 W. That should still be in the St. Louis area.

To be precise, I should confirm the state. St. Louis is in Missouri. Is there any chance it's in another state? Illinois is right across the river, but let's verify.

The Mississippi River separates Missouri and Illinois. St. Louis is on the western bank, so in Missouri. Given the longitude -90.2451, which is west of the river, I believe.

Actually, upon second thought, the coordinates 38.6359 N, 90.2451 W – let me think about the exact location. I can reason that this is definitely in the Midwest US.

If I plot it mentally: Latitude 38° is around the level of California to Missouri. Longitude -90° is through the Mississippi River area. Specifically, -90° longitude runs through Louisiana, up through Memphis, Tennessee, and into Missouri and Illinois.

For 38.6359 N and -90.2451 W, that's precisely in the St. Louis metropolitan area, which is in Missouri.

To confirm without doubt: I know that the Gateway Arch in St. Louis is at about 38.6248° N, 90.1851° W. The given coordinates are very close, so yes, it's in Missouri.

The state is Missouri.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. Maybe start with a brief explanation and then end with the answer.

Final answer: Missouri
