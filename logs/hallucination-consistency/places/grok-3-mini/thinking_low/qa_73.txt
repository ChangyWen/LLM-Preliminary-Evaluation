*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 42.1155 and longitude -72.5395 is located. I need to determine which US state that corresponds to.

Latitude 42.1155 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -72.5395 is in the western hemisphere, which points to the United States.

To find the exact location, I should recall or look up what area these coordinates fall into. From my knowledge:

- Latitude around 42 degrees North is in the northeastern US.

- Longitude around -72 degrees West is also in the northeastern US, possibly New England area.

Let me think about specific states:

- Massachusetts is around there. Boston, for example, is at about 42.3601° N, 71.0589° W.

- This latitude 42.1155 N and longitude -72.5395 W seems close to Springfield, Massachusetts.

I believe Springfield, MA is approximately at 42.1015° N, 72.5895° W. That's very close to the given coordinates.

So, 42.1155 N and -72.5395 W is likely in Massachusetts.

To be precise, I should confirm if it's exactly in Massachusetts or perhaps a neighboring state like Connecticut or New York.

- Connecticut is south of Massachusetts, with latitudes around 41-42 N, but let's check borders.

The border between Massachusetts and Connecticut is around 42 N latitude in some parts, but I need to be accurate.

Upon double-checking, the coordinates 42.1155 N, -72.5395 W are in Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Springfield.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the state is Massachusetts.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and clear. I can say something like: "Based on the coordinates provided, latitude 42.1155 and longitude -72.5395, this location is in the state of Massachusetts."

Then, end with the final answer on a new line.

Final answer: Massachusetts
