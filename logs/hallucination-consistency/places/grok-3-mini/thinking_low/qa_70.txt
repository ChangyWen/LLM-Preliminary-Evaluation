*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 34.0378 and longitude -80.9036 is located. I need to determine which US state that corresponds to.

Latitude 34.0378 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -80.9036 is in the western hemisphere, which points to the United States.

To find the exact location, I should recall or look up what area these coordinates fall into. From my knowledge:

- Latitude around 34 degrees North is in the southeastern US.

- Longitude around -81 degrees West is also in the Southeast.

Specifically, let's think about major cities or known locations:

- Columbia, South Carolina, is approximately at 34.0000 N, 81.0350 W.

The given coordinates are 34.0378 N, -80.9036 W.

That's very close to Columbia, SC. Let me double-check:

Upon verification, Columbia, South Carolina, is indeed around 34.0007° N, 81.0348° W. Wait, no:

Actually, looking it up in my knowledge: Columbia, SC is at approximately 34.0000° N, 81.0000° W, but more precisely, it's 34.0522° N, 81.0398° W for the city center, I think. Wait, I need to be accurate.

From standard knowledge:

- Latitude 34.0378 N and Longitude -80.9036 W.

This is very close to Elgin, South Carolina, or perhaps directly in Richland County, which is part of the Columbia metropolitan area.

To confirm, I can think of it as being in South Carolina.

Using a mental map:

- South Carolina's latitudes range from about 32° to 35° N.

- Longitudes from about -78° to -83° W.

So, 34.0378 N and -80.9036 W falls within South Carolina.

More precisely, it's near the center of the state.

I believe this is in or near the city of Columbia, which is the capital of South Carolina.

Therefore, the state is South Carolina.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be something like: After determining the coordinates, I find that this location is in South Carolina.

Then, end with the final answer on a new line.

Make sure it's accurate. Is there any chance it's in another state? For example, North Carolina is north of that, around 35° N and above.

No, 34° N is definitely South Carolina.

Georgia is south, around 33° N, and North Carolina is north.

So, yes, South Carolina.
