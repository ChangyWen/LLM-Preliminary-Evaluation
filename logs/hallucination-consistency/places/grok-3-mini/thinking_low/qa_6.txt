*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked about the state for the location with latitude 29.786 and longitude -95.3885. I need to determine which state in the US this corresponds to.

Latitude 29.786 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -95.3885 is in the western hemisphere. This places it in the United States.

To pinpoint the exact location, I should recall or know that these coordinates are for Houston, Texas. Let me verify:

- Houston, Texas, is approximately at 29.76° N latitude and 95.37° W longitude. That's very close to 29.786 N and 95.3885 W.

Yes, so this is in Texas.

Is it exactly in Texas? Let me double-check if there's any border issue. Houston is definitely in Texas, and these coordinates are within the city limits.

The user specified "state," so I should confirm it's not in another state. Latitude 29.786 is south, around the Gulf Coast area. Longitude -95.3885 is along the Texas coast.

Possible states nearby: Texas, Louisiana, but Louisiana is further east, around -90 to -94 longitude. -95 is squarely in Texas.

For reference:

- New Orleans, Louisiana, is about 30 N, 90 W.

- Houston is 29.7 N, 95.3 W.

So, yes, definitively Texas.

My response should end with the final answer on a new line. The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, structure my response like this:

- Maybe a brief explanation.

- Then, on a new line, just the state name.

Final answer should be: Texas

Make sure it's accurate. Is there any chance it's in another state? For example, if it's exactly on a border, but no, Houston is inland Texas.

Alright, response plan:

1. Acknowledge the query.

2. State the location briefly.

3. Confirm the state.

4. End with the final answer on a new line.
