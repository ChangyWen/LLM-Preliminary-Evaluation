First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 33.2175 and longitude -97.1418 is located. I need to determine which US state that corresponds to.

Latitude 33.2175 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -97.1418 is in the western hemisphere, so it's in the United States.

To find the exact state, I should recall or look up the coordinates. I know that:

- Texas is around latitudes 25-36 N and longitudes 93-107 W.

More precisely, let's think about major cities. Longitude -97 is roughly in the central US.

I believe latitude 33 N and longitude -97 W is in Texas. For example, Dallas is around 32.7767 N, -96.7970 W, and Fort Worth is nearby.

Let me check: Latitude 33.2175 N and Longitude -97.1418 W.

That sounds like it's near Denton, Texas. I think Denton, Texas is approximately at 33.2148 N, -97.1331 W. That's very close!

So, yes, that's in Texas.

To be thorough, I should confirm if it's exactly in Texas or near the border. The coordinates are clearly within Texas borders.

Texas borders Oklahoma to the north, but Oklahoma is further north and west. Oklahoma's southern border is around 33-37 N, but longitude -97 is still in Texas at that latitude.

The Red River forms the border between Texas and Oklahoma, and it's around there. But 33.2175 N, -97.1418 W is south of that, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, definitely in Texas.

So, the state is Texas.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. Maybe start with a brief explanation and then give the answer.

Final answer: Texas
