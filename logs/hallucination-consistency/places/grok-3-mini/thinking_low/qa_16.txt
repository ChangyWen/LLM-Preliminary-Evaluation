*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 44.9635 and longitude -93.2678 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 44.9635 N (positive means North)

Longitude: -93.2678 (negative means West)

So, this is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States has various states with coordinates in this range. Let me think about where this might be.

Latitude around 45 degrees North is in the northern part of the US, like Minnesota, Wisconsin, or up to Canada.

Longitude around -93 degrees West is in the central US.

Specifically, -93 longitude passes through states like Minnesota.

I recall that Minneapolis, Minnesota, is around there. Let me verify mentally:

I think the coordinates for Minneapolis are approximately 44.9778° N, 93.2650° W. That's very close to 44.9635 N and -93.2678 W.

Yes, that matches almost exactly. So, this should be in Minnesota.

To be thorough, let's confirm if it's precisely in Minnesota. The coordinates given are 44.9635 N, -93.2678 W, which is very near the city center of Minneapolis.

Minneapolis is in Hennepin County, Minnesota, USA.

Is there any chance it could be in a neighboring state? Latitude 44.96 is south of the Canadian border and north of, say, Iowa or Wisconsin, but longitude -93 is west of Wisconsin and east of North Dakota.

Wisconsin's longitude is around -89 to -92, so -93 is further west, into Minnesota.

Yes, definitely Minnesota.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, my response should be clear and end with the answer on a new line.

Structure:

- I can start with a brief explanation.

- Then, state the answer.

Final answer: Minnesota

Make sure it's the state, not the city. The question says "What state does the place... located in?"

Yes, so "Minnesota" is the state.
