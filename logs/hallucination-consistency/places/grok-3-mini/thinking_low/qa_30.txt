*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.4397 and longitude -79.9763 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 40.4397° N (since it's positive)

Longitude: -79.9763° (which means 79.9763° W)

This is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

To find the state, I should recall or look up what location these coordinates correspond to. From my knowledge:

- Latitude around 40° N is in the central United States.

- Longitude around 80° W is in the eastern part of the US.

Specifically, 40.4397° N and 79.9763° W sounds familiar. I think that's Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Let me double-check:

- Pittsburgh is in Pennsylvania.

- Approximate coordinates for Pittsburgh are about 40.4406° N, 79.9959° W. That's very close to 40.4397° N and -79.9763° W.

Yes, so this is in Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania is a state in the United States.

I should confirm if it's exactly in Pennsylvania or near the border. Given the coordinates, it's well within Pennsylvania.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "The coordinates 40.4397 latitude and -79.9763 longitude correspond to a location in Pittsburgh, which is in the state of Pennsylvania."

Then, end with the final answer on a new line.

Final answer: Pennsylvania

Make sure it's just the state name, as per the question.

The question says: "What state does the place with latitude 40.4397 and longitude -79.9763 located in?"

So, directly, the state is Pennsylvania.
