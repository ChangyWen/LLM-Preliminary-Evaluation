*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 41.0798 and longitude -81.5219 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 41.0798 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -81.5219 is in the western hemisphere. This places it in the United States.

To be precise, I should recall or look up what city or area this corresponds to. I know that Akron, Ohio, is around there. Let me verify: Akron's coordinates are approximately 41.0814° N, 81.5190° W, which is very close to 41.0798° N, 81.5219° W.

So, this is likely in Akron, Ohio.

Ohio is a state in the United States. I need to confirm if these exact coordinates are within Ohio's boundaries. Given the proximity, yes, they are.

The user asked for the state, so the answer should be "Ohio".

Finally, the instructions say to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

Response structure:
- I can provide a brief explanation.
- Then, end with the final answer on a new line.
