*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 43.0642 and longitude -87.9675 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 43.0642° N (positive means North)

Longitude: -87.9675° (negative means West)

So, this is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States has various states with coordinates in this range. Let me think about where this might be.

Latitude around 43° N is in the northern part of the US, like Wisconsin, Michigan, or Minnesota.

Longitude around -87° W is further east. For reference:

- New York is around -74° to -79°

- Chicago is around -87° W, and Chicago is in Illinois, but let's check the latitude.

Chicago's latitude is about 41.8781° N, which is south of 43°.

43° N is north of Chicago. Wisconsin is north of Illinois.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is around 43° N and -87° W. Let me verify that.

From my knowledge, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has coordinates approximately 43.0389° N, -87.9067° W.

That's very close to 43.0642° N, -87.9675° W.

So, this should be in Wisconsin.

To be precise, I should confirm if these exact coordinates are within Wisconsin's boundaries.

Wisconsin's boundaries:

- Northern border with Michigan and Lake Superior

- Eastern border with Lake Michigan

- Southern border with Illinois

- Western with Minnesota and Iowa

At latitude 43° N and longitude -87° W, that's along the Lake Michigan shoreline in southeastern Wisconsin.

Yes, Milwaukee is in southeastern Wisconsin.

I can think about nearby cities or use a mental map.

If I plot it roughly:

- Latitude 43° N crosses through Wisconsin.

- Longitude -87° W is right around Milwaukee.

So, the state is Wisconsin.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

My response should be structured: some explanation if needed, but end with the answer on a new line.

Finally, just state the answer clearly.
