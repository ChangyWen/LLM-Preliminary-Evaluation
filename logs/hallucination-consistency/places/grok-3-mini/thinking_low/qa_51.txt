*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 35.4676 and longitude -97.5136 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 35.4676° N (since it's positive)

Longitude: -97.5136° (which means 97.5136° W)

This is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States has various states with different latitudes and longitudes. Let me recall:

- Oklahoma is around there. Oklahoma City is a major city in Oklahoma, and I think its coordinates are close to this.

I believe Oklahoma City's coordinates are approximately 35.4676° N, 97.5136° W. That sounds exactly like what's given.

So, if these are the coordinates for Oklahoma City, then it's in Oklahoma.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this is indeed in Oklahoma and not on the border of another state.

Oklahoma is bordered by Texas to the south, Arkansas to the east, Missouri to the northeast, Kansas to the north, Colorado to the northwest, New Mexico to the west, and it has a panhandle.

The latitude 35.4676 is around the central part of the US, and longitude -97.5136 is further west.

Specifically:

- Latitude 35° is roughly the line that goes through Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Missouri.

- Longitude -97° is in the central US, passing through Oklahoma and Texas.

Oklahoma's coordinates range from about 33.75° N to 37° N latitude and 94.43° W to 103° W longitude.

So, 35.4676° N and -97.5136° W falls squarely within Oklahoma.

In fact, as I thought, that's Oklahoma City.

Therefore, the state is Oklahoma.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, my response should end with something like:

[Final Answer]

Oklahoma

I need to make sure the format is exact. The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

I'll structure my response accordingly.
