*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked about the state for the coordinates: latitude 30.3005 and longitude -97.7522.

I need to recall or know where these coordinates are. Latitude 30.3005 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -97.7522 is in the western hemisphere, specifically in the United States.

I believe these coordinates are for Austin, Texas. Let me double-check: Austin, Texas is approximately at 30.2672° N latitude and 97.7431° W longitude. That's very close to 30.3005 N and -97.7522 W.

So, yes, this is in Texas.

To be precise, I should confirm if it's exactly in Texas or perhaps on the border. But based on standard knowledge, 30.3005 N and -97.7522 W is definitely within Texas.

Texas is a state in the United States, and these coordinates are well within its boundaries.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief explanation and then end with the answer.

Final answer: Texas

Make sure it's on a new line.
