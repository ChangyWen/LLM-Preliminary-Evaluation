First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 35.9692 and longitude -83.9496 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 35.9692° N (since it's positive)

Longitude: -83.9496° (which means 83.9496° W)

So, this is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

To find the state, I should recall or look up which US state this falls into. I know that:

- Latitudes around 35° N are in the southern US.

- Longitudes around -84° W are in the eastern US, possibly Tennessee or nearby states.

I think this is Knoxville, Tennessee. Let me verify:

From my knowledge, Knoxville, Tennessee has coordinates approximately 35.9606° N, 83.9207° W. That's very close to 35.9692° N, -83.9496° W.

So, yes, this is in Tennessee.

To be precise, I should confirm if it's exactly in Tennessee or perhaps on the border. But based on standard coordinates, 35.9692 N, 83.9496 W is definitely in Tennessee.

Tennessee's boundaries:

- It borders Kentucky to the north, Virginia to the northeast, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, Arkansas and Missouri to the west, and Kentucky and Virginia again.

Specifically, around longitude -83.9, that's eastern Tennessee.

No other states are at that exact latitude and longitude. For example:

- North Carolina is a bit east and north.

- Georgia is south.

- Kentucky is north.

So, confirmed: Tennessee.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. Maybe start with a brief explanation and then end with the answer.

Final answer: Tennessee
