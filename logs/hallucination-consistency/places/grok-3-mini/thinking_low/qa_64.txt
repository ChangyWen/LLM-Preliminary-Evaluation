First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 36.1283 and longitude -95.9042 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 36.1283° N (positive means North)

Longitude: -95.9042° (negative means West)

So, this is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States is in this region. To pinpoint the state, I should think about which states are around these coordinates.

Latitude 36° is roughly around the level of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, etc. Longitude -95° is further west, probably in the central US.

Let me recall: Tulsa, Oklahoma is around there. I think Tulsa's coordinates are approximately 36.15° N and 95.99° W, which is very close to 36.1283 N and 95.9042 W.

Yes, that matches. So, this should be in Oklahoma.

To be thorough, let's confirm the boundaries:

- Oklahoma's latitude ranges from about 33.75° N to 37° N.

- Longitude from about 94.43° W to 103° W.

So, 36.1283 N and -95.9042 W (which is 95.9042° W) falls within Oklahoma.

Nearby states:

- To the north is Kansas (around 37° N and above).

- To the south is Texas (but Texas goes up to about 36.5° N in some parts, but this is more central).

- East is Missouri, Arkansas.

But specifically, -95.9042 W is east of Oklahoma's western border.

I can think of major cities: Tulsa is in Oklahoma, and its coordinates are indeed around 36.16° N, 95.90° W. Close enough.

So, the place is in Oklahoma.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and not just the answer. Maybe explain briefly.

Final answer: Oklahoma
