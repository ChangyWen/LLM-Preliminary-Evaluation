*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 47.6211 and longitude -122.3244 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 47.6211 N and longitude -122.3244 W. Negative longitude means it's west of the Prime Meridian, so in the Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States has various states with different latitudes and longitudes. Latitude around 47 degrees North is in the northern part of the US. For example, Washington state is around there.

Let me recall: Seattle, Washington, is approximately at 47.6062 N, 122.3321 W. That sounds very close to 47.6211 N, -122.3244 W.

Yes, comparing:

- Given: 47.6211 N, -122.3244 W

- Seattle: about 47.6062 N, -122.3321 W

They're very close. So, this is likely in Washington state.

To be precise, I should confirm if this exact point is in Washington. Based on my knowledge, the coordinates are within the Seattle area, which is in King County, Washington.

Washington state borders Canada to the north, Oregon to the south, and Idaho to the east. Longitude -122 is on the west coast, so definitely in Washington.

Just to double-check, other states nearby: Oregon is south of Washington, around 45 N latitude, so 47 N is too far north. Idaho is east, with longitudes around -116 or so. So, yes, this is Washington.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "The coordinates 47.6211 latitude and -122.3244 longitude are located in the state of Washington, USA."

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

Response structure:

- Start with a brief explanation.

- End with the final answer on a new line.
