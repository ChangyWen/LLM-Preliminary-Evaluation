*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.8501 and longitude -73.8662 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 40.8501 N (positive means North)

Longitude: -73.8662 (negative means West)

So, this is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States has many locations in this range. Let me think about major cities or areas.

Latitude around 40 degrees North is roughly the level of New York City, Philadelphia, or Denver.

Longitude around -73 degrees West is specifically on the East Coast.

New York City is approximately at 40.7128 N, -74.0060 W. That's close but not exact.

Let me check the given coordinates: 40.8501 N, -73.8662 W.

That sounds like it's in New York state. Let me verify with known locations.

I recall that Yonkers, New York, is around there. Let me think: Yonkers is in Westchester County, New York, and its coordinates are approximately 40.9312 N, -73.8987 W. That's a bit north.

Perhaps it's in the Bronx or somewhere in New York City.

Actually, looking it up in my knowledge: Latitude 40.8501 and Longitude -73.8662 is very close to the location of Fordham University in the Bronx, New York.

The Bronx is part of New York City, which is in New York State.

To be precise, I should confirm if it's exactly in New York State.

Given that it's around 40.85 N and -73.87 W, that's definitely in the New York metropolitan area.

The border: New York State borders Connecticut and New Jersey, but at this longitude, it's well within New York State.

For example, the Hudson River is around there, and crossing it would go to New Jersey, but -73.8662 is east of the Hudson.

New York City is on the east side of the Hudson for Manhattan, but the Bronx is further east.

Longitude -73.8662 is about 73 degrees 52 minutes West, which is east of the Hudson River.

The Hudson River is around -73.9 to -74.0 for parts of it.

Manhattan is between approximately -73.97 and -73.93, but the Bronx extends further east.

Upon second thought, 40.8501 N, -73.8662 W is in the Bronx, New York.

To confirm, I can think of it as being in New York State.

Is there any chance it's in another state? For example, Pennsylvania is further south and west, Connecticut is east but at similar latitude, but longitude -73 is more west for Connecticut.

Connecticut's longitudes are around -72 to -73.5, so -73.8662 might be on the border.

Hartford, CT is at about -72.68, and the western border of Connecticut is around -73.7.

The border between New York and Connecticut is along the line where longitude is about -73.7 for parts, but let's be accurate.

The point 40.8501 N, -73.8662 W is specifically in Westchester County or the Bronx.

Upon checking my knowledge, that's in the Bronx, New York City.

For instance, Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx is around there.

So, it's in New York State.

Therefore, the state is New York.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should end with something like:

New York

On a new line.

I should make sure my response is clear and not verbose. The instruction is to reason step by step, but the final answer separately.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I can have my reasoning, then the answer.

Finally, box it as per the system prompt, but wait, no, the system prompt says to put the final answer within \boxed{}.

In the initial setup, it says: "put your final answer within \boxed{}."

So, I need to do that.

Alright, so my final answer is New York.
