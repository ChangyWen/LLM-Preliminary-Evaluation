*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked about the state for the coordinates: latitude 31.8476 and longitude -106.43.

I need to recall what these coordinates represent. Latitude and longitude pinpoint a location on Earth. Latitude 31.8476 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -106.43 is in the Western Hemisphere.

To find the state, I should think about which US state this falls into. The US has states in various latitudes and longitudes.

Let me visualize or recall: Latitude around 31-32 degrees North is in the southern US. For example, Texas is around there.

Specific cities: I know El Paso, Texas, is near the US-Mexico border. Let me check if these coordinates match El Paso.

From my knowledge, El Paso's coordinates are approximately 31.7619° N, 106.4850° W. That's close to 31.8476 N and 106.43 W.

31.8476 is a bit north of 31.7619, and -106.43 is east of -106.4850 (since longitude west is negative, so -106.43 is less negative than -106.4850, meaning it's east).

But it's very close. El Paso is in Texas.

To be precise, I should confirm if this exact point is in Texas.

The coordinates are 31.8476 N, 106.43 W.

Looking it up in my knowledge: This is likely in New Mexico or Texas. The border between Texas and New Mexico is around there.

El Paso is in Texas, and just across the border is New Mexico.

Longitude -106.43: The Texas-New Mexico border is at approximately 103° W to 106.5° W or something? Wait, no.

Actually, the western border of Texas is at 103° W, but El Paso is at the far west of Texas.

El Paso County, Texas, extends to about 104.5° W to 106° W, I think. Wait, no.

More accurately: El Paso is at around 106.5° W, and it's in Texas. New Mexico is to the north and west.

For latitude 31.8476 N, that's south of 32° N, which is the border between New Mexico and Texas in that area? Wait, no.

The border between Texas and New Mexico is along the 32nd parallel north for part of it, but actually, it's more complex.

Upon second thought: The 32nd parallel is the boundary between Oklahoma and Texas, not New Mexico.

For New Mexico and Texas, the border is along the Rio Grande and then straight lines.

Specifically, El Paso is in Texas, and the coordinates given are very close to El Paso.

I can think of it this way: Popular knowledge places 31.8476, -106.43 as in El Paso, Texas.

To confirm: Let's assume it's El Paso. So, the state is Texas.

Is there any chance it's in Mexico? Latitude 31.8476 is north, so it's in the US, not Mexico. Ciudad Juarez is just south of El Paso, across the border.

So, yes, 31.8476 N is definitely in the US.

Therefore, the place is in Texas.

My final answer should be: Texas

So, I need to structure my response accordingly. Perhaps give a brief explanation and then the answer on a new line.
