*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked about the state for the coordinates: latitude 35.1054 and longitude -106.6465.

I need to recall or know where these coordinates are. Latitude 35.1054 N and longitude -106.6465 W. Negative longitude means west of the Prime Meridian, so that's in the Western Hemisphere.

These coordinates sound familiar. I think that's around Albuquerque, New Mexico. Let me double-check that.

Albuquerque is in New Mexico, and I believe its coordinates are approximately 35.0844° N, 106.6504° W. That's very close to 35.1054° N, -106.6465° W. So, yes, it's in New Mexico.

To be precise, I should confirm if this exact point is within New Mexico's boundaries. New Mexico is in the southwestern United States, bordered by Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and Mexico.

Given that, latitude around 35° N is in the southern part of the US, and longitude around -106° W is in the central-western US, which aligns with New Mexico.

I can think about nearby cities or landmarks. For example, if it's near Albuquerque, that's definitely in New Mexico.

Just to be thorough, let's consider if it could be in another state. The coordinates are:

- Latitude: 35.1054° N (that's between 30° and 40° N, so southern US)

- Longitude: -106.6465° W (that's around the Rocky Mountains area)

States in that vicinity: New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, etc. But specifically, -106° W is more towards New Mexico.

For reference:

- Denver, Colorado is about 39.7392° N, -104.9903° W

- Phoenix, Arizona is about 33.4484° N, -112.0740° W

- Albuquerque, New Mexico is 35.0844° N, 106.6504° W

Yes, so 35.1054° N, -106.6465° W is very close to Albuquerque's coordinates.

Therefore, the place is in New Mexico.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. Maybe start with a brief explanation and then end with the answer.

Final answer: New Mexico
