First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 38.8674 and longitude -104.7605 is located. I need to determine which US state that corresponds to.

I know that latitude and longitude pinpoint a location on Earth. Latitude 38.8674 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -104.7605 is in the western hemisphere, which suggests it's in the United States.

To find the exact state, I should recall or look up which state is at those coordinates. From my knowledge:

- Latitude around 38-39 degrees North is in the central US.

- Longitude around -104 degrees West is in the Rocky Mountain region.

Specifically, -104.7605 longitude is near Colorado Springs, which is in Colorado.

Let me double-check: Colorado Springs is indeed at approximately 38.8339° N, 104.8214° W. That's very close to 38.8674° N, 104.7605° W.

So, yes, that's in Colorado.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this is exactly in Colorado or possibly on the border with another state. The coordinates given are 38.8674 N, 104.7605 W, which is within Colorado's boundaries.

Colorado's borders are:

- North: Wyoming and Nebraska

- South: New Mexico and Oklahoma

- East: Kansas and Nebraska

- West: Utah

At latitude 38.8674, that's south of Denver, which is around 39.7° N, so it's in southern Colorado.

Longitude -104.7605 is east of the Rocky Mountains, so definitely in eastern Colorado.

Therefore, the state is Colorado.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief explanation and then end with the answer.

Final answer: Colorado
