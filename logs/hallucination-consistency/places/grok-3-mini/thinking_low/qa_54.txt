*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 32.7817 and longitude -97.3474 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 32.7817 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -97.3474 is in the western hemisphere. This points to somewhere in the United States.

I recall that major cities have specific coordinates. Let me think: Fort Worth, Texas, is around there. I believe Fort Worth is at approximately 32.7555° N, 97.3302° W. That's very close to 32.7817° N, 97.3474° W.

Let me double-check that. Upon reflection, yes, those coordinates are indeed for Fort Worth, Texas. So, this place is in Texas.

To be precise, I should confirm if it's exactly in Fort Worth or nearby. But the user just asked for the state, not the city.

Texas is a state in the US, and these coordinates are within Texas.

Just to be thorough, let's ensure there are no border issues. Latitude 32.7817 is south of Oklahoma's border, which is around 36° N, and west of Louisiana, which is further east. Longitude -97.3474 is west of the Mississippi River, so definitely in Texas.

The coordinates are very close to Fort Worth, which is in Tarrant County, Texas.

So, the state is Texas.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

I need to structure my response accordingly. I should have some explanation if needed, but end with the final answer on a new line.

For example:

After reasoning, I'll say something like: "Based on the coordinates provided, the location is in the state of Texas."

Then, on a new line: "Texas"

That matches the instruction.
