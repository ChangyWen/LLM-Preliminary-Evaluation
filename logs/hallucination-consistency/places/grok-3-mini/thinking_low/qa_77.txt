First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 42.9619 and longitude -85.6562 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 42.9619° N (since it's positive)

Longitude: -85.6562° (which means 85.6562° W)

So, this is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

To find the state, I should recall or look up which US state this falls into. I know that:

- Latitudes around 40-45° N are in the northern US.

- Longitudes around -85° are in the central US, possibly the Midwest.

Let me think about specific states:

- Michigan is known for having coordinates in that range. For example, Grand Rapids, Michigan, is around there.

I believe 42.9619° N and -85.6562° W is very close to Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Let me verify mentally:

- Grand Rapids, MI, has approximate coordinates: 42.9634° N, 85.6681° W.

That's extremely close to the given 42.9619° N and -85.6562° W. So, it's in Michigan.

To be thorough, I should confirm if it's exactly in Michigan or possibly near the border.

Michigan's Lower Peninsula is between approximately 41° to 45° N and 82° to 90° W, but more precisely, western Michigan is around -85° to -87° W.

Yes, -85.6562° W is definitely in Michigan.

Other states nearby:

- Ohio is more east, around -80° to -85° W, but Ohio's northern part is around 41° N.

- Indiana is around -85° W but more south, around 40° N.

- Wisconsin is further west and north, around -87° to -92° W and 42° to 47° N, but -85° is east of that.

Actually, -85° W runs through Michigan, Indiana, and Kentucky, but at 43° N, it's Michigan.

Specifically, at 42.96° N and -85.66° W, it's in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan.

So, the state is Michigan.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

My response should be helpful and direct, but since this is a simulation, I'll keep it straightforward.

Final answer: Michigan
