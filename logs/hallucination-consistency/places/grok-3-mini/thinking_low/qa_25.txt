First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 33.9381 and longitude -117.3949 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 33.9381 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -117.3949 is in the Western Hemisphere, specifically in the US.

To pinpoint the exact location, I should recall or look up what city or area this corresponds to. From my knowledge, latitude around 33.9 and longitude around -117.4 sounds like it's in Southern California.

Let me think: Los Angeles is approximately at 34.0522° N, 118.2437° W. That's close but not exact. -117.3949 is west of that, so perhaps further east? Wait, no: longitude decreases as you go west, so -117 is east of -118.

Actually, Los Angeles is at about -118.24, and -117.39 is east of that because -117 is greater than -118 in value (less negative).

Standard US longitudes: New York is around -74, Chicago -87, Denver -105, LA -118.

So, -117.3949 is between LA and further east. I believe this is in the Inland Empire area of California.

Specifically, I think this is Riverside, California. Let me confirm: Riverside, CA is approximately at 33.9806° N, 117.3962° W. That's very close to 33.9381° N, -117.3949° W.

Yes, so it's in Riverside, which is in California.

Therefore, the state is California.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and clear. I can say something like: "Based on the coordinates you provided, latitude 33.9381 and longitude -117.3949, this location is in the state of California."

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
