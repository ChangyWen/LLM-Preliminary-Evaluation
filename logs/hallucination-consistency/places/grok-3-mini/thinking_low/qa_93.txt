First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 27.2796 and longitude -80.3884 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 27.2796 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -80.3884 is in the western hemisphere. To find the exact location, I should think about which US state this falls into.

I know that latitudes around 27 degrees north are in the southern part of the United States. For example, Florida is around there. Let me recall some major cities:

- Miami, Florida is approximately 25.76° N.

- Orlando, Florida is about 28.54° N.

- So, 27.2796° N is between Miami and Orlando, likely in central Florida.

Longitude -80.3884° W: Florida's east coast is around -80° W. For instance, West Palm Beach is about -80.05° W, and further south.

Let me pinpoint this. Latitude 27.2796 N and Longitude -80.3884 W sounds like it's near Port St. Lucie or Stuart in Florida.

I can think of it as being in Florida. To confirm, I should consider if it could be in another state. The Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic coast might overlap, but -80° W at 27° N is definitely on the east coast of Florida.

Quick mental map: The US states along that latitude include parts of Florida, Georgia, but Georgia is further north, around 30-33° N. So, no, 27° N is squarely in Florida.

Therefore, the place is in Florida.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "Based on the coordinates provided, latitude 27.2796 and longitude -80.3884, this location is in the state of Florida."

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer: Florida
