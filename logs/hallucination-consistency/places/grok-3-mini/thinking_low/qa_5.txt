*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 32.7935 and longitude -96.7667 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 32.7935 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -96.7667 is in the western hemisphere. This points to somewhere in the United States.

I recall that Dallas, Texas, is around that area. Let me verify: Dallas is approximately at 32.7767째 N latitude and 96.7970째 W longitude. That's very close to 32.7935 N and 96.7667 W.

So, these coordinates are likely in Dallas, Texas.

Texas is a state in the United States. I should confirm if this exact point is within Texas boundaries. Given the proximity to Dallas, it should be.

The user asked for the state, so I don't need to specify the city unless asked. Just the state: Texas.

Finally, the response should end with the final answer on a new line.
