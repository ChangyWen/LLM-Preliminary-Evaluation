*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 37.5295 and longitude -77.4756 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 37.5295 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -77.4756 is in the western hemisphere, which means it's in the United States.

To pinpoint the exact location, I should recall or look up what city or area this corresponds to. From my knowledge, latitude around 37.5 and longitude around -77.5 sounds like it's near Richmond, Virginia.

Let me verify: Richmond, Virginia, has coordinates approximately 37.5405° N, 77.4360° W. That's very close to 37.5295° N, 77.4756° W. So, yes, this is in Virginia.

To be precise, I can confirm that this latitude and longitude fall within the state of Virginia. Virginia is in the eastern United States, and these coordinates are definitely within its borders.

The user asked for the state, so I don't need to specify the city unless asked. But just to be thorough, it's likely in or near Richmond.

Finally, the response should end with the final answer on a new line. So, structure my response accordingly.

Response structure:
- Provide a brief explanation.
- End with the state name on a new line.
