*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 27.9945 and longitude -82.4447 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 27.9945 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -82.4447 is in the western hemisphere. This places it in the United States, likely in the southeastern part.

I recall that Florida has coordinates around there. Let me think: Tampa, Florida, is near that area. I should verify.

From my knowledge:

- Miami, Florida, is around 25.76 N, 80.19 W.

- Orlando is about 28.54 N, 81.38 W.

- Tampa is approximately 27.95 N, 82.46 W.

That matches closely: 27.9945 N and -82.4447 W (which is 82.4447 W).

So, this is very close to Tampa, Florida.

Tampa is in Hillsborough County, Florida, which is in the state of Florida.

To be precise, I should confirm if these exact coordinates are within Florida's boundaries. Florida extends from about 24.5 N to 31 N latitude and from about 80 W to 87 W longitude, so yes, this is well within Florida.

There's no ambiguity; it's clearly in Florida.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "The coordinates 27.9945 latitude and -82.4447 longitude are located in the state of Florida."

Then, end with the final answer on a new line.

Final answer: Florida

Make sure it's just the state name, as specified.
