*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 33.6096 and longitude -117.6551 is located. I need to determine which state in the US this corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are coordinates. Latitude 33.6096 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -117.6551 is in the western hemisphere.

I know that the US has various states with different coordinates. Let me think about where this might be.

Longitude -117 is around the west coast. For example, California has longitudes from about -114 to -124. More precisely, Los Angeles is around -118, and San Diego is around -117.

Latitude 33.6096 is about 33 degrees north. Southern California, like San Diego, is around 32-33 degrees north.

So, latitude 33.6096 N and longitude -117.6551 W sounds like it's in Southern California.

Let me verify if this is exact. I recall that Irvine, California, is around there. Upon a quick mental check, yes, Irvine, CA, has coordinates approximately 33.6846 N, -117.8265 W. Wait, that doesn't match exactly.

The given is 33.6096 N, -117.6551 W. Let me think of nearby places. Laguna Niguel or Mission Viejo might be close.

I can reason that this is in Orange County, California, which is part of the state of California.

To be precise, I should confirm if this is indeed in California and not in another state like Arizona or Nevada, but those have different longitudes.

Arizona is around -109 to -114, which is east of -117. Nevada is around -114 to -120, but latitudes might differ.

More accurately:

- California: Longitudes from about -114 (southeast) to -124 (northwest).

- Specifically, -117 is definitely in California, as it's west of Arizona.

So, yes, this should be in California.

Now, the user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

My response should be structured: I can have some reasoning, but end with the answer on a new line.

Finally, state the answer clearly.
