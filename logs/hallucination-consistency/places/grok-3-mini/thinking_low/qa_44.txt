*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.7776 and longitude -111.9311 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 40.7776 N (positive means North)

Longitude: -111.9311 (negative means West)

So, this is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States has various states with coordinates in this range. Let me think about where this might be.

Longitude around -111 is in the western US. For example:

- Utah is around -111 to -114 longitude.

- Specifically, Salt Lake City, Utah, is near 40.7608 N, -111.8910 W. That sounds very close!

Let me verify that. The given coordinates are 40.7776 N, -111.9311 W.

Comparing to Salt Lake City: Approximately 40.76 N, -111.89 W.

It's very close. In fact, 40.7776 is a bit north of 40.76, and -111.9311 is a bit west of -111.89.

So, this should be in Utah.

To be precise, I should confirm if it's exactly in Utah or perhaps on the border.

Utah's borders: It borders Idaho to the north, Wyoming to the northeast, Colorado to the east, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west.

The latitude 40.7776 is around the level of northern Utah.

Longitude -111.9311 is west of the Wasatch Front, which is where Salt Lake City is.

I can use my knowledge that this is definitely in Utah. No other state has coordinates exactly like this.

For example:

- Colorado is more east, around -105 to -109.

- Wyoming is around -104 to -111, but more north (41-45 N).

- Idaho is around -111 to -117, and latitudes 42-49 N, so a bit north.

40.7776 N is south of Idaho's southern border, which is around 42 N.

So, yes, 40.7776 N and -111.9311 W is squarely in Utah.

Specifically, near Salt Lake City.

The user asked for the state, so the answer should be "Utah".

Finally, the response needs to end with the final answer on a new line.

So, structure my response: I can briefly explain, then give the answer.

Response format: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, something like:

After reasoning, final answer on a new line.
