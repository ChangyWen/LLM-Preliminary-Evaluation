*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.6501 and longitude -73.9496 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 40.6501 N (positive means North)

Longitude: -73.9496 (negative means West)

So, this is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States has coordinates in this range. Specifically, New York City is around 40.7128 N, -74.0060 W. Let me compare:

- Given: 40.6501 N, -73.9496 W

- NYC approximate: 40.7128 N, -74.0060 W

This is close to NYC, but let's pinpoint it more accurately.

I recall that Brooklyn, New York, has coordinates around there. Let me think: Brooklyn is part of New York City, and its coordinates are approximately 40.6782 N, -73.9442 W. That's very close to 40.6501 N, -73.9496 W.

Upon double-checking my knowledge:

- Exact match: 40.6501 N, -73.9496 W is likely in Brooklyn, New York.

To confirm, I can think about the bounding boxes:

- New York State is roughly between 40° N to 45° N and -73° W to -79° W.

More precisely, for this coordinate:

- Latitude 40.6501 is south of Manhattan but still in the NYC area.

- Longitude -73.9496 is east of Manhattan, which points to Brooklyn or Queens.

Using my knowledge, this is in Brooklyn, which is in New York State.

Is it exactly in New York State? Yes, because NYC is in New York State.

To be thorough, let's ensure it's not in another state. For example, New Jersey is across the river, but its longitudes are around -74.0 to -75.0, and latitudes similar, but -73.9496 is definitely on the New York side.

So, the state is New York.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

My response should be clear and not verbose, as per the system prompt.

Structure:

- I can briefly explain or just state it, but keep it concise.

- End with the final answer on a new line.

Final answer: New York

Make sure it's the state, not the city. The question says "What state does the place... located in?"

Yes, so "New York" is the state.
