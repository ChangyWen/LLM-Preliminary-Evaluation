*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 39.3051 and longitude -76.6144 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 39.3051° N (positive means North)

Longitude: -76.6144° (negative means West)

So, this is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States has various states with coordinates in this range. Let me recall:

- Latitude around 39° is in the eastern US. For example, New York is around 40-45°, Washington D.C. is about 38-39°, and Baltimore is in Maryland.

I think Baltimore, Maryland, is at approximately 39.29° N, 76.61° W. That matches closely with 39.3051 N and -76.6144 W.

Let me confirm: Yes, Baltimore, Maryland, is indeed at about 39.2904° N, 76.6122° W. The given coordinates are very close, so it's likely in Maryland.

To be thorough, I should check if this could be in another state. The coordinates are in the mid-Atlantic region.

- Virginia is south of that, around 37-39° N, but more eastward.

- Pennsylvania is north, around 40-42° N.

- Delaware is around 39° N but further east.

Using a mental map: Longitude -76° is along the East Coast. For example:

- New York City is about -74°.

- Washington D.C. is about -77°.

- So, -76° is between them, which is Maryland.

Specifically, Baltimore is in Maryland, and these coordinates pinpoint to Baltimore or nearby areas in Maryland.

Therefore, the state is Maryland.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "Based on the coordinates provided, latitude 39.3051 and longitude -76.6144, this location is in the state of Maryland."

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
