*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 39.5497 and longitude -119.8483 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 39.5497° N (positive means North)

Longitude: -119.8483° (negative means West)

So, this is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States has various states with coordinates in this range. Let me think about where this might be.

Longitude around -119° is in the western part of the US. For example:

- California is around -114° to -124°

- Nevada is around -114° to -120°

More precisely:

- Nevada's longitude ranges from about -114° W to -120° W.

Latitude 39.5° N is in the central part of the US west.

For instance:

- Reno, Nevada is approximately at 39.5296° N, -119.8133° W.

That sounds very close! Let me verify.

The given coordinates are 39.5497 N, -119.8483 W.

Comparing to Reno: 39.5296 N, -119.8133 W.

It's very nearby, probably in the Reno area.

Reno is in Nevada, USA.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this exact point is in Nevada or perhaps in a neighboring state.

Neighboring states:

- To the west: California, but California's eastern border is around -114° for the south, but for this latitude, the border with Nevada is along the Sierra Nevada mountains.

The border between Nevada and California at this latitude is roughly at -120° W, but let me think.

Actually, Reno is definitely in Nevada, and these coordinates are right there.

I can use my knowledge: The coordinates 39.5497, -119.8483 are in Washoe County, Nevada, near Reno.

So, the state is Nevada.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

My response should be structured accordingly.

Keep it clear and not verbose.

Final answer: Nevada

Make sure it's just the state name.

Response structure:

- I can have a brief explanation if needed, but since the user said "please give me your final answer in a new line at the end," I should have some context and then the answer.

For example:

After analyzing the coordinates, I determine that the location is in Nevada.

Then, on a new line: Nevada

Yes.
