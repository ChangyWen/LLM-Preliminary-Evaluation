First, the user asked about the state for the location with latitude 30.442 and longitude -91.1311. I need to determine which US state this corresponds to.

Latitude 30.442 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -91.1311 is in the western hemisphere, which points to the United States.

To find the exact state, I should recall or look up the coordinates. I know that:

- Louisiana is around 30-31 degrees north latitude and -89 to -94 degrees west longitude.

Let me verify that. Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is a major city with coordinates approximately 30.45 N and 91.15 W. That sounds very close.

Yes, looking it up in my knowledge: Baton Rouge, LA is at about 30.4515° N, 91.1549° W. The given coordinates are 30.442 N and -91.1311 W, which is extremely close to Baton Rouge.

So, this is in Louisiana.

Is it exactly in Louisiana? Let me double-check the boundaries. Louisiana's eastern border is with Mississippi, western with Texas, northern with Arkansas, and southern with the Gulf of Mexico. The coordinates 30.442 N and -91.1311 W are well within Louisiana's territory.

To be thorough, I can think about nearby states:

- Mississippi is to the east, around -88 to -91 longitude, but more east.

- Texas is further west, around -94 to -95.

- Arkansas is north, around 33-36 N.

So, yes, 30.442 N and -91.1311 W is definitely in Louisiana.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and clear. I can say something like: "Based on the coordinates provided, latitude 30.442 and longitude -91.1311, this location is in the state of Louisiana."

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
