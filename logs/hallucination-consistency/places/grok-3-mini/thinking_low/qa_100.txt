*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked about the state for the coordinates: latitude 47.6671 and longitude -117.433.

I need to recall what these coordinates represent. Latitude and longitude pinpoint a location on Earth. Latitude 47.6671 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -117.433 is west of the Prime Meridian.

To find the state, I should think about which US state this falls into. The US has various states with known latitude and longitude ranges.

Let me visualize or recall: Latitude around 47 degrees North is in the northern part of the US, like Washington, Idaho, Montana, etc.

Longitude -117 is in the western US. For example:

- Washington state is around 46-49 N and 116-125 W.

More precisely:

- Spokane, Washington, is a city I know. Its coordinates are approximately 47.6588 N, -117.4260 W.

That sounds very close! Latitude 47.6671 and longitude -117.433 is almost exactly Spokane, Washington.

So, this location is in Washington state.

To double-check, I should consider if it could be in another state. Idaho is east of Washington, and its western border is around longitude -117.

Actually, the border between Washington and Idaho is along the 117th meridian west, which is exactly longitude -117.

Spokane is in Washington, just west of that border.

Confirming the exact coordinates: Latitude 47.6671 N, Longitude -117.433 W.

Yes, that's in Spokane, which is in Washington state.

If it were slightly east, say over -117, it might be in Idaho, but -117.433 is west of -117, so it's in Washington.

Longitude increases westward for negative values. Longitude -117.433 is more west than -117.000.

The Idaho-Washington border is at 117° W, which is -117.000.

So, anything west of -117.000 (like -117.433) is in Washington, and east of it would be Idaho.

Yes, so -117.433 is west of -117.000, confirming it's in Washington.

Therefore, the state is Washington.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, my response should end with something like:

Washington

On a new line.
