*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 42.9018 and longitude -78.8487 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 42.9018° N (since it's positive)

Longitude: -78.8487° (which means 78.8487° W)

This is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere, so it's in North America.

To pinpoint the exact location, I should recall or know that these coordinates are for Buffalo, New York. Let me verify:

- Buffalo, New York is around 42.8864° N, 78.8784° W. That's close but not exact.

The given coordinates are 42.9018 N, 78.8487 W. Let me double-check if that's accurate.

Upon second thought, I believe 42.9018° N, 78.8487° W is indeed in the vicinity of Buffalo, New York.

To be precise, I can think about how to determine the state:

- Latitude around 42-43° N and longitude around -78-79° W is in the northeastern United States.

- Specifically, this falls within New York State.

I know that:

- New York State is between approximately 40° N to 45° N and 71° W to 79° W.

More accurately:

- Western New York, where Buffalo is, is around 42-43° N and 78-79° W.

To confirm, let's consider nearby states:

- To the west is Ontario, Canada, across Lake Erie.

- To the south is Pennsylvania.

- To the east is other parts of New York.

- To the north is Canada.

Given the coordinates, 42.9018 N, 78.8487 W, this is definitely in the US, not Canada, as the border is around 42-43° N in that area, but Buffalo is south of the border.

Buffalo is in New York, USA.

I can use a mental map: Cities like Buffalo are in New York.

If I were to use a tool, I'd plug these into Google Maps or a GPS, but since I can't, I'll rely on knowledge.

Assuming it's Buffalo, which is in Erie County, New York.

So, the state is New York.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

My response should be structured: I can have some reasoning, but end with the answer on a new line.

Finally, just state the state name.

Response structure:

- I can say something like: "Based on the given coordinates, latitude 42.9018 and longitude -78.8487, this location is in the state of New York."

- Then, on a new line: "New York"

To make it clear.
