First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 42.6664 and longitude -73.7987 is located. I need to determine which US state that corresponds to.

Latitude 42.6664 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -73.7987 is in the western hemisphere, so it's in the US.

To find the exact location, I should recall or look up what area this coordinates point to. From my knowledge:

- Latitude around 42 degrees is in the northeastern US.

- Longitude around -73 degrees is also in the northeast, possibly New York or nearby states.

Let me think about major cities:

- New York City is around 40.7 N, -74 W, so a bit south.

- Albany, New York, is around 42.65 N, -73.78 W. That sounds very close.

Let me verify: Latitude 42.6664 and Longitude -73.7987.

Yes, that's approximately Albany, New York. Albany is the capital of New York state.

So, this location is in New York state.

I should confirm if it's exactly in New York or perhaps on the border. But based on standard coordinates, Albany is definitely in New York.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "The coordinates 42.6664 latitude and -73.7987 longitude are located in the state of New York."

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

Response structure:

- Start with a brief explanation.

- End with the final answer on a new line.
