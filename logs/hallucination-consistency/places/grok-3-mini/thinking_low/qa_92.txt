*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.2752 and longitude -76.8843 is located. I need to determine which US state this corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are coordinates. Latitude 40.2752 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -76.8843 is in the western hemisphere, which points to North America, likely the United States.

To find the exact location, I should recall or look up what city or area this is. I know that:

- Latitude around 40 is in the northeastern US.

- Longitude around -76 is in the eastern part of Pennsylvania.

I think this is Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Let me double-check:

- Harrisburg, PA has coordinates approximately 40.2737° N, 76.8844° W. That's very close to 40.2752 N, -76.8843 W.

So, yes, this is in Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania is a state in the US.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and clear. I can start with a brief explanation and then end with the answer.

Final answer: Pennsylvania

Make sure it's just the state name, as specified.

Response structure:

- Optional: A short explanation.

- Then, on a new line, the final answer.
