*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 26.6443 and longitude -81.9957 is located. I need to determine which US state or territory this corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are coordinates: 26.6443° N and -81.9957° W. Positive latitude is North, negative longitude is West.

I know that the United States has various states, and I need to pinpoint this location. Let me think about where these coordinates might be.

Latitude 26.6443 is quite south. For reference:

- Florida's southern tip is around 25° N.

- Miami is about 25.76° N.

- So, 26.6443° N is still in Florida, probably central or southern part.

Longitude -81.9957° W is in the eastern part of the US.

Florida's west coast is around -80° to -87° W. Let's be precise:

- The east coast of Florida is around -80° W.

- The west coast goes further west.

Miami is about -80.19° W, and Fort Myers is around -81.84° W. Let me confirm that.

Upon thinking, Fort Myers, Florida, is approximately at 26.64° N and -81.84° W. That sounds very close!

Let me double-check: The given coordinates are 26.6443 N and -81.9957 W.

Yes, that's very close to Fort Myers, which is in Lee County, Florida.

So, this should be in Florida.

To be thorough, is there any other state that could have these coordinates? Latitude 26° is only in southern Florida in the contiguous US. Hawaii is around 20° N, but its longitudes are around -155° to -160° W, which is way west.

Puerto Rico is around 18° N and -66° W, not matching.

So, definitely Florida.

The exact location: 26.6443 N, -81.9957 W. If I were to look it up, this is likely in or near Fort Myers, which is in southwestern Florida.

Therefore, the state is Florida.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.
