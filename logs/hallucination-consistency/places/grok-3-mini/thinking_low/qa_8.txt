*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked about the state for the coordinates: latitude 33.7628 and longitude -84.422.

I need to recall what these coordinates represent. Latitude 33.7628 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -84.422 is in the western hemisphere, which means it's in the United States.

To pinpoint the exact location, I should think about major cities or known places. Latitude around 33 degrees is in the southern part of the US. For example, Atlanta, Georgia is around 33.7490 N and 84.3880 W, which is very close to 33.7628 N and -84.422 W.

Let me double-check that. Yes, Atlanta's coordinates are approximately 33.76 N and -84.39 W. So, this is likely Atlanta, Georgia.

Georgia is a state in the US, so the state would be Georgia.

To be thorough, I should confirm if these coordinates are exactly in Georgia. The coordinates are very close to Atlanta, which is in Fulton County, Georgia. There's no chance it's in a neighboring state because Atlanta is inland and surrounded by Georgia.

Neighboring states to Georgia include Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida, but their latitudes and longitudes don't match this closely.

For example:

- Alabama is around 32-35 N and -85 to -88 W, but -84.422 is more east.

Longitude -84.422 is specifically in the eastern part of the US, and with latitude 33.7628, it's definitely Georgia.

I can think about the exact location: plugging these into a map mentally, it's right in the heart of Atlanta.

So, the state is Georgia.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and not just the answer. Maybe I can say something like: "Based on the coordinates you provided, latitude 33.7628 and longitude -84.422, this location is in the state of Georgia, United States."

Then, end with the final answer on a new line.

Final answer: Georgia

Make sure it's clear.
