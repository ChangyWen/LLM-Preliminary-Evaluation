*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked about the state for the coordinates: latitude 26.2252 and longitude -98.2467.

I need to recall how to determine the location from latitude and longitude. Latitude is north-south, and longitude is east-west. Positive latitude is north, negative is south. Positive longitude is east, negative is west.

So, latitude 26.2252 is north (since it's positive), and longitude -98.2467 is west (since it's negative). This places it in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere, likely in North America.

To find the exact state, I should think about which US states are around these coordinates. I know that the US is in the Western Hemisphere, and states like Texas, Florida, etc., have varying latitudes and longitudes.

Let me recall some approximate coordinates:

- Texas is roughly between 25° to 36° N latitude and 93° to 107° W longitude.

More precisely, the southern tip of Texas is around 26° N, and it extends west.

Longitude -98 is around the central part of the US. For example:

- New York is around 74° W.

- Chicago is around 87° W.

- Dallas, Texas is around 97° W.

- So, -98° W is very close to Texas.

Latitude 26° N is quite south. The southernmost point of the US mainland is in Florida, around 25° N, but Texas's southern border is also around 26° N near the Gulf of Mexico.

I think the coordinates 26.2252 N, 98.2467 W are in Texas. Specifically, that sounds like it's near McAllen or Edinburg in the Rio Grande Valley.

I can confirm this mentally: McAllen, Texas is approximately at 26.203 N, 98.23 W. That's very close to 26.2252 N, 98.2467 W.

So, yes, that's in Texas.

To be thorough, let's ensure it's not in another state. Mexico is south of Texas, but these coordinates are in the US. The US-Mexico border is along the Rio Grande, and 26.2252 N is north of that in Texas.

Longitude -98.2467 W is west of the Mississippi, so not in the eastern states.

Possible states: Texas is the most likely. Louisiana is further east, around 90-94° W, and its southern part is around 29-30° N. So, no.

Florida is around 80-87° W and 24-31° N, but that's east.

So, definitely Texas.

My final answer should be: Texas
