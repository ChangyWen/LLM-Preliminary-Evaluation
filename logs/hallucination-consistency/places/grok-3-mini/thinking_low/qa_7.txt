*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.0077 and longitude -75.1339 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 40.0077° N (since it's positive)

Longitude: -75.1339° (which means 75.1339° W)

This is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States has various states with coordinates in this range. Let me think about where this might be.

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is around there. I recall Philadelphia's coordinates are approximately 39.9526° N, 75.1638° W. That's close but not exact.

Let me double-check: 40.0077 N and -75.1339 W.

Upon a quick mental map, this is very close to Philadelphia. In fact, let's confirm if it's within Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania's latitude ranges roughly from about 39.7° N to 42.3° N, and longitude from about -74.7° W to -80.5° W. So, 40.0077 N and -75.1339 W falls within that.

Specifically, -75.1339 W is around the eastern part of Pennsylvania, near the border with New Jersey.

Is it exactly in Pennsylvania? Let me think about nearby cities.

Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania, and its coordinates are about 39.95° N, 75.16° W. The given coordinates are 40.0077 N, which is a bit north, and -75.1339 W, which is slightly east of Philadelphia's longitude.

Philadelphia's longitude is about -75.16, and this is -75.13, so yes, close.

Perhaps it's in the Philadelphia area. To be precise, I should confirm if it's in Pennsylvania or possibly New Jersey, since the border is nearby.

The Delaware River separates Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Philadelphia is on the Pennsylvania side.

Let me estimate: Latitude 40.0077 is north of Philadelphia's center. For example, the northern parts of Philadelphia or suburbs.

Upon second thought, this might be in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, still in Pennsylvania.

I can think of it as being in Pennsylvania.

To be accurate, I should recall that coordinates around 40 N and -75 W are in southeastern Pennsylvania.

For instance, Allentown, PA is around 40.6 N, -75.5 W, which is further north and west.

No: 40.0077 is very close to 40 N, and -75.1339 is almost exactly where Philadelphia is.

Perhaps it's in Montgomery County or Bucks County in Pennsylvania.

I know that the White House in Washington D.C. is at 38.8977 N, -77.0366 W, which is south.

New York City is at 40.7128 N, -74.0060 W, which is east.

40.0077 N and -75.1339 W is between NYC and D.C., specifically in PA.

I can confidently say it's in Pennsylvania.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be something like: After reasoning, the place is located in Pennsylvania.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

Response structure: I can say a brief explanation and then the answer.

For example: "Based on the coordinates provided, latitude 40.0077 and longitude -75.1339, this location is in the state of Pennsylvania."

Then, on a new line: Pennsylvania

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, perhaps: [Some text] 

Final answer: Pennsylvania

Yes.
