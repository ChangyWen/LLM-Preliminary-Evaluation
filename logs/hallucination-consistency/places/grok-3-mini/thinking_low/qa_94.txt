*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked about the state for the location with latitude 33.7977 and longitude -118.167. I need to determine which state in the US this corresponds to.

Latitude 33.7977 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -118.167 is in the western hemisphere, so it's in the US.

To pinpoint the exact location, I recall that Los Angeles is around there. Let me think: Los Angeles is approximately at 34°N and 118°W, which matches closely with 33.7977°N and 118.167°W.

More precisely, I know that Long Beach, California, is near that coordinate. Let me confirm: Yes, Long Beach, CA, is at about 33.77°N, 118.19°W, which is very close to 33.7977°N and -118.167°W.

So, this location is in California.

Is it exactly in California? Let me double-check if there's any border nearby. Latitude 33.7977 is south of Los Angeles proper, which is around 34°, so it's in the southern part of California, near the coast.

Longitude -118.167 is west of the 118th meridian, which runs through California.

Therefore, the state is California.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and clear. I can briefly explain how I arrived at the answer, but keep it concise.

Final answer: California

Make sure to put it on a new line at the end.
