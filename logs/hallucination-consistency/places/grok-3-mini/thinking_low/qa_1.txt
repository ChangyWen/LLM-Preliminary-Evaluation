*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.6943 and longitude -73.9249 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 40.6943° N (positive means North)

Longitude: -73.9249° (negative means West)

So, this is in the Northern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States has many locations in this range. Let me think about major cities or areas.

New York City is around 40.7° N and 74° W. Let me verify:

- New York City's approximate coordinates are 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W.

The given longitude is -73.9249, which is about 73.9249° W.

That's close to New York City. Let me pinpoint it more accurately.

I recall that Brooklyn, New York, has coordinates around 40.6782° N, 73.9442° W.

Let me calculate the exact match.

Latitude 40.6943 N and Longitude -73.9249 W.

This seems to be in Queens, New York, or perhaps near Jamaica, Queens.

I can use my knowledge: The coordinates 40.6943, -73.9249 are for Jamaica, Queens, in New York City.

New York City is in the state of New York.

To be precise, let's confirm if it's within the state boundaries.

The coordinates are definitely in New York State, as they fall within the NYC metropolitan area.

Other states nearby: New Jersey is to the west, but its eastern parts are around 74° W or further west.

Pennsylvania is further west and south.

So, 40.6943 N, -73.9249 W is squarely in New York State.

Final answer should be the state: New York.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

Response structure:

- Start with a confirmation or explanation.

- End with the answer on a new line.
