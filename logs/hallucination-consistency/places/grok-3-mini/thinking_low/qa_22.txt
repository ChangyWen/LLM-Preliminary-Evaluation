*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked about the state for the coordinates: latitude 36.2333 and longitude -115.2654.

I need to recall how to determine the location from latitude and longitude. Latitude is north-south, and longitude is east-west. Negative longitude means west of the Prime Meridian, so this is in the Western Hemisphere.

Latitude 36.2333 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -115.2654 is about 115 degrees west.

I know that the United States has various states with their coordinates. Let me think about where this might be.

Longitude around -115 is in the western US. For example, California is around -118 to -124, Nevada is around -114 to -120, Arizona is similar.

More precisely:

- Nevada is roughly between 114° W and 120° W longitude, and 35° N to 42° N latitude.

Latitude 36.2333 is about 36 degrees north, which is in the southern part of Nevada.

I recall that Las Vegas is in Nevada, and its coordinates are approximately 36.1699° N, 115.1398° W.

The given coordinates are 36.2333 N and -115.2654 W, which is very close to Las Vegas.

So, Las Vegas is in Clark County, Nevada.

Therefore, this location is in Nevada.

To be thorough, let's confirm if it's exactly in Nevada. The state borders:

- To the west is California.

- To the east is Arizona and Utah.

- To the north is Oregon and Idaho.

- To the south is Arizona and California.

Specifically, at latitude 36.2333 N and longitude -115.2654 W, that's well within Nevada. Las Vegas is inland, not near the borders that might confuse it with another state.

I can think about the exact point. If I were to plot it, it's probably in the Las Vegas area.

So, the state is Nevada.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

My response should be something like: [Explanation] and then on a new line: Nevada

Keep it clear and not verbose.
