First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.5834 and longitude -74.1496 is located. I need to determine which US state this corresponds to.

I know that latitude and longitude pinpoint a location on Earth. Latitude 40.5834 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -74.1496 is in the western hemisphere.

To find the exact location, I can think about major cities or landmarks. Latitude around 40 degrees north is common for the northeastern US, like New York.

Let me recall some known coordinates:

- New York City is approximately at 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W.

The given longitude is -74.1496, which is close to New York's longitude.

Let me calculate roughly:

Given: 40.5834° N, -74.1496° W

New York City: 40.7128° N, -74.0060° W

This is a bit south and west of NYC.

40.5834 is less than 40.7128, so it's south of NYC.

And -74.1496 is more negative than -74.0060, which means it's west of NYC.

So, perhaps in New Jersey, since NYC is on the border.

I think this might be in New Jersey. Let me think about Newark, NJ. I believe Newark is around 40.7357° N, -74.1724° W, which is north and west of the given coordinates.

That doesn't match. Let me double-check.

Actually, upon second thought, latitude 40.5834 is south of NYC's 40.7128.

Perhaps it's in Staten Island or somewhere in New York state, but wait.

Longitude -74.1496 is west of NYC, which would put it in New Jersey.

I recall that the coordinates for Elizabeth, NJ, or something nearby.

I can use my knowledge: The area around 40.58 N and -74.15 W is in New Jersey.

Specifically, I think that's near Perth Amboy or Woodbridge in New Jersey.

To confirm, the state boundary: New York City is on the east side, and just west is New Jersey.

Yes, the Hudson River separates them, but at that latitude, it's New Jersey.

More precisely, latitude 40.5834 N and longitude -74.1496 W is in Middlesex County, New Jersey.

So, the state is New Jersey.

To be thorough, let's ensure it's not in another state. Pennsylvania is further west, around -75 or more. Connecticut is east, around -73.

Yes, -74 longitude is definitely in New Jersey for that latitude.

Final answer should be New Jersey.
