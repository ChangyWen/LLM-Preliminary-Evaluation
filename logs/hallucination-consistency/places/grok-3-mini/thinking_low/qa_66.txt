*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 39.7805 and longitude -84.2003 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 39.7805 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -84.2003 is in the western hemisphere, which means it's in the United States.

To pinpoint the exact location, I should recall or look up what city or area this corresponds to. I know that Dayton, Ohio, is around there. Let me verify:

- Dayton, Ohio, has coordinates approximately 39.7589° N, 84.1916° W.

The given coordinates are 39.7805 N and 84.2003 W, which is very close to Dayton.

So, 39.7805 is a bit north of 39.7589, and 84.2003 is slightly west of 84.1916. This should still be in the Dayton area.

Dayton is in Montgomery County, Ohio. Ohio is a state in the US.

To be precise, I should confirm if these exact coordinates are within Ohio. Based on my knowledge, yes, that latitude and longitude fall within Ohio.

The state boundary: Ohio's southern border is around 38-39 degrees north, but more precisely, the coordinates given are well within Ohio.

Latitude 39.78 is north of Cincinnati (around 39.1) and south of Toledo (around 41.6), so definitely in Ohio.

Longitude -84.20 is around the western part of Ohio, near Indiana border, but still in Ohio.

So, the place is in Ohio.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and clear. I can say something like: "Based on the coordinates provided, latitude 39.7805 and longitude -84.2003, this location is in the state of Ohio."

Then, end with the final answer on a new line.

Final answer: Ohio

Make sure it's just the state name, as per the question.

The question says: "What state does the place with latitude 39.7805 and longitude -84.2003 located in?"

So, directly, the state is Ohio.
