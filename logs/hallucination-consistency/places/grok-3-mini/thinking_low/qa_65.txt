*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.5961 and longitude -75.4756 is located. I need to determine which US state this corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are coordinates. Latitude 40.5961 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -75.4756 is in the western hemisphere, which points to North America, likely the United States.

To find the exact location, I should recall or look up what city or area this is. I know that:

- Latitude around 40 is roughly the area of New York, Pennsylvania, etc.

- Longitude around -75 is along the East Coast.

Specifically, I think this might be in Pennsylvania. Let me think about major cities:

- Philadelphia is around 39.95° N, 75.16° W.

- New York City is about 40.71° N, 74.01° W.

- For 40.5961 N and -75.4756 W, that sounds like Allentown, Pennsylvania.

I believe Allentown, PA is approximately at 40.6083° N, 75.4903° W. That's very close to 40.5961 N and -75.4756 W.

So, yes, this is in Pennsylvania.

To be thorough, I should confirm if it's exactly in Pennsylvania or perhaps near the border. Pennsylvania borders New Jersey and New York, but given the coordinates, it's west of the Hudson River, so definitely in PA.

Finally, the user wants the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

Response structure:

- I can start with a brief explanation.

- End with the answer on a new line.
