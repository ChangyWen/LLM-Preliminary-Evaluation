*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 36.1715 and longitude -86.7842 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude: 36.1715° N (since it's positive)

Longitude: -86.7842° (which means 86.7842° W)

This is in the United States, as these coordinates are in the continental US range.

To pinpoint the exact location, I should recall or know that:

- Latitude around 36° is in the southern US.

- Longitude around -86° is in the central US, specifically around Tennessee or Kentucky.

I think these coordinates are for Nashville, Tennessee. Let me double-check:

From my knowledge, Nashville, Tennessee has approximate coordinates of 36.1627° N, 36.1715 is very close to that.

Yes, looking it up in my knowledge base: Nashville is at about 36.17° N, 86.78° W.

So, latitude 36.1715 N and longitude -86.7842 W is indeed in Nashville, Tennessee.

Therefore, the state is Tennessee.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and clear. I can say something like: "Based on the given coordinates, the location is in the state of Tennessee."

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.

Response structure:

- Start with a brief explanation.

- End with the final answer on a new line.
