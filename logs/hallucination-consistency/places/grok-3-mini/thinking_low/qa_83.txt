*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.2457 and longitude -111.6457 is located. I need to determine which US state that corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are coordinates. Latitude 40.2457 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -111.6457 is west of the Prime Meridian.

To find the state, I should recall or look up which states are around these coordinates. I know that:

- Latitude around 40 is in the central US.

- Longitude around -111 is in the western US.

Specifically, let's think about the Rocky Mountain states. Utah is around there. I believe Salt Lake City, Utah, is at approximately 40.7608° N, 111.8910° W. That's close but not exact.

The given coordinates are 40.2457° N, -111.6457° W.

Let me compare:

- Salt Lake City: 40.76° N, 111.89° W

- Given: 40.25° N, 111.65° W

That's very close. In fact, 40.2457 is south of Salt Lake City, and -111.6457 is a bit east of it.

Upon second thought, I should confirm with known locations. Provo, Utah, is near there. I think Provo is at about 40.2338° N, 111.6585° W. That's almost exactly the given coordinates!

Let me verify:

- Provo, Utah: Approximately 40.2338° N, 111.6585° W

- Given: 40.2457° N, -111.6457° W

Yes, that's very close. So, this is in Utah.

To be thorough, I should ensure it's not in a neighboring state. The borders:

- Utah borders Idaho to the north, Wyoming to the northeast, Colorado to the east, Arizona to the south, and Nevada to the west.

At latitude 40.2457, which is around the same as Denver (39.7392° N), but longitude -111.6457 is further west.

Denver is at -104.9903° W, which is east of -111° W. So, -111° W is west of Denver, in the Utah area.

Specifically, the point is in central Utah.

I can think about the exact location. Using a mental map or recall that this is in Utah County, near Provo.

So, the state is Utah.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

My response should be something like: [Explanation] and then on a new line: Utah

Keep it concise.
