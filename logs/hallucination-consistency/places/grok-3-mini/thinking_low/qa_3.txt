*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 41.8375 and longitude -87.6866 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 41.8375 N and longitude -87.6866 W. Negative longitude means it's west of the Prime Meridian, so in the Western Hemisphere.

I know that Chicago, Illinois, is around there. Let me verify: Chicago's coordinates are approximately 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W. That's close but not exact.

The given coordinates are 41.8375 N, -87.6866 W. Let me see if I can pinpoint this.

Using my knowledge, 41.8375 latitude and -87.6866 longitude is in the Chicago area. Specifically, let's think about it:

- Latitude 41.8 is around Chicago's latitude.

- Longitude -87.6 is also in that range.

Upon closer inspection, this might be Midway International Airport in Chicago. I recall Midway's coordinates are about 41.7860° N, 87.7524° W. That's not exact.

Perhaps it's O'Hare? O'Hare is 41.9742° N, 87.9073° W, which is north and west.

Let me calculate roughly. The given is 41.8375 N, -87.6866 W.

I believe 41.8375, -87.6866 is actually in Chicago, Illinois. Let me confirm with known points.

I can think of it as being in the United States, specifically in the Midwest.

To be precise, I should determine the state. Coordinates around 41-42 N and 87-88 W are in Illinois.

For example:

- Chicago is in Illinois.

- To confirm, let's see if it's within Illinois boundaries.

Illinois is bordered by Wisconsin to the north, Indiana to the east, Kentucky to the south, Missouri to the southwest, Iowa to the west, and the Mississippi River.

Given that, latitude 41.8 is south of Wisconsin's southern border, which is around 42.5 N.

Longitude -87.6 is east of the Mississippi River, which is around -90 W.

So, yes, 41.8375 N, -87.6866 W is definitely in Illinois.

Is it possibly in Indiana? Indiana is east of Illinois, so longitudes around -87 are still in Illinois. Chicago is at -87.6, and Indiana starts around -87.5 or so for its western border, but actually, Chicago is well within Illinois.

The state line between Illinois and Indiana is along the lake and then straight west, but for these coordinates, -87.6866 W is west of the state line.

Illinois's eastern border with Indiana is approximately at longitude -87.52 W for the Chicago area, but Chicago itself is at -87.62, so yes, -87.6866 is further west, so in Illinois.

Therefore, the place is in Illinois.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response.

So, my response should end with something like:

[Final Answer]

Illinois

Or just on a new line: Illinois

The instruction: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I'll structure it as: Explain briefly, then on a new line, the answer.
