*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 36.7335 and longitude -76.0435 is located. I need to determine which US state that corresponds to.

Latitude 36.7335 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -76.0435 is in the western hemisphere, which points to the United States.

To find the exact location, I should recall or look up what coordinates these are. I know that:

- Latitude around 36-37 degrees North is in the southeastern US.

- Longitude around -76 degrees is on the East Coast.

Specifically, longitude -76 is near the Chesapeake Bay area.

Let me think about major cities:

- Washington D.C. is around 38.907 N, -77.036 W.

- That's a bit north and west.

- Virginia Beach is in Virginia, and I believe it's around 36.85 N, -75.98 W. Let me verify that.

Upon double-checking my knowledge:

- Virginia Beach, Virginia, is approximately at 36.8529° N, 75.9780° W.

The given coordinates are 36.7335 N, -76.0435 W.

That's very close to Virginia Beach. Let me confirm:

- 36.7335 is a bit south of 36.8529, and -76.0435 is slightly west of -75.9780.

Longitude -76.0435 is west of -75.9780 because -76 is more negative, so further west.

But Virginia Beach is in southeastern Virginia, near the Atlantic Ocean.

Perhaps it's in Norfolk or another nearby city.

I can use a mental map or recall that this area is in Virginia.

To be precise, let's plot it:

- Latitude 36.7335 N: That's between Richmond, VA (around 37.54 N) and the North Carolina border (around 36.5 N).

- Virginia's southern border with North Carolina is around 36.5 N.

- So, 36.7335 N is definitely in Virginia.

- Longitude -76.0435 W: This is east of the Appalachian Mountains and near the coast.

Specific cities:

- Norfolk, VA is at approximately 36.8503° N, 76.2859° W.

- That's close: 36.85 N and -76.28 W.

The given is 36.7335 N and -76.0435 W.

-76.0435 is east of -76.2859 because -76.0435 is less negative.

Longitude increases eastward in the negative west: -76.0435 is east of -76.2859.

Perhaps it's in Chesapeake or Suffolk, Virginia.

I can confirm that the coordinates 36.7335, -76.0435 are in Virginia.

Upon quick mental search, I believe this is in the city of Chesapeake, Virginia, which is in the Hampton Roads area.

Yes, Chesapeake, VA is around there.

So, the state is Virginia.

To be thorough, let's ensure it's not in North Carolina. North Carolina starts around 36.5 N, but the exact border might vary.

The Virginia-North Carolina border is approximately at 36.5 N, but it follows the state line, not exactly a latitude line. However, for these coordinates, it's north of that.

Specifically, the city of Chesapeake is in Virginia, and these coordinates fall within it.

Therefore, the state is Virginia.

My final answer should be: Virginia
