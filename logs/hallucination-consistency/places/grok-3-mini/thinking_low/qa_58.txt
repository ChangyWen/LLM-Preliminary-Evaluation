First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 41.2627 and longitude -96.0529 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 41.2627 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -96.0529 is in the Western Hemisphere, specifically in the United States.

To pinpoint the exact location, I should recall or look up what city or area these coordinates correspond to. From my knowledge, latitude 41.2627 and longitude -96.0529 is very close to Omaha, Nebraska.

Let me double-check: Omaha, Nebraska has approximate coordinates of 41.2565° N, 96.0080° W. That's pretty close to 41.2627° N, -96.0529° W. So, yes, it's in Omaha.

Omaha is in the state of Nebraska.

To be precise, I should confirm if these exact coordinates are within Nebraska's boundaries. Nebraska is bordered by South Dakota to the north, Iowa to the east, Missouri to the southeast, Kansas to the south, Colorado to the southwest, and Wyoming to the west.

Given the longitude -96.0529, which is around 96 degrees west, that's in the central part of the US, and latitude 41.2627 is in the northern Midwest. This places it squarely in Nebraska.

I can think about nearby states: Iowa is to the east of Nebraska, and its western border is around 95-96 degrees west, but Omaha is on the eastern side of Nebraska, right on the border with Iowa. However, the coordinates given are still within Nebraska.

Upon second thought, the Missouri River forms the border between Nebraska and Iowa, and Omaha is on the west side of the river, so in Nebraska.

So, the place is in Nebraska.

The user asked to give the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can start with a brief explanation and then end with the answer.

Final answer: Nebraska
