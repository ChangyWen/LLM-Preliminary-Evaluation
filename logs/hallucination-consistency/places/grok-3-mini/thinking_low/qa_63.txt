First, the user asked about the state for the location with latitude 36.783 and longitude -119.7939. I need to determine which US state this corresponds to.

Latitude 36.783 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -119.7939 is in the western hemisphere, which points to the United States.

To pinpoint the exact location, I should recall or know that longitudes around -120 are in California. Let me think about the coordinates:

- Latitude 36.783 is roughly in the central part of California.

- Longitude -119.7939 is also in California.

I believe this is near Fresno, California. Let me double-check:

Fresno, California, has coordinates approximately 36.7373° N, 119.7871° W. That's very close to 36.783 N and -119.7939 W.

So, yes, this is in California.

To be thorough, I should confirm if it's exactly in California. The state boundaries:

- California extends from about 32° N to 42° N latitude and from about -114° W to -124° W longitude.

More precisely, the western boundary is the Pacific Ocean, and the eastern boundary with Nevada is around -114° W, but for this longitude, -119.7939 is well within California.

No other states are nearby with these coordinates. For example:

- Nevada is east of California, so longitudes more negative than -114° or so.

Longitude increases westward, so -120 is west of -114. Negative longitudes go from 0 at Greenwich westward.

Standard: Longitude -119 is west of -114, so deeper into the west coast.

California's eastern border with Nevada is approximately at longitude -114° to -120° in some parts, but actually, it's around -114° for the southern part and varies.

For latitude 36.783, which is in central California, longitude -119.7939 is definitely in California.

I can think of nearby cities: Fresno is at 36.783, -119.794, which matches exactly.

So, the place is in Fresno, California.

Therefore, the state is California.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

My response should be something like: [Explanation] and then on a new line: California

Keep it concise.
