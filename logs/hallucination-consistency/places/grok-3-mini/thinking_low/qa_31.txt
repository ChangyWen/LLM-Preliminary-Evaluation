*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked about the state for the coordinates: latitude 39.1413 and longitude -84.506.

I need to recall or know where these coordinates are. Latitude 39.1413 N and longitude -84.506 W. Negative longitude means west of the Prime Meridian, so that's in the Western Hemisphere, likely in the United States.

Let me think about US states. Latitude around 39 degrees North is in the central part of the US. For example, Ohio is around there. Cincinnati, Ohio, is near that area. I believe Cincinnati's coordinates are approximately 39.1031° N, 84.5120° W. That's very close to 39.1413° N, -84.506° W.

So, this should be in Ohio.

To be precise, I should confirm if it's exactly in Ohio or perhaps in a neighboring state. Kentucky is south of Ohio, and Indiana is west. The Ohio River borders Ohio and Kentucky, and Cincinnati is right on that border.

Let me double-check: Latitude 39.1413 is a bit north of Cincinnati's center, but still in the Cincinnati area. Longitude -84.506 is very close to Cincinnati's longitude.

Upon a quick mental map, this is definitely in Ohio. Specifically, it might be in or near Cincinnati.

The user asked for the state, so I don't need the city, just the state.

Finally, the response should end with the final answer on a new line.

So, my response structure: I can briefly explain, then give the answer.

Response: "The coordinates 39.1413 latitude and -84.506 longitude are located in the state of Ohio."

Then, on a new line: "Ohio"
