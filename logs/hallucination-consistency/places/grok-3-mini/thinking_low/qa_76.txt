*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 41.2279 and longitude -111.9682 is located. I need to determine which US state that corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are coordinates. Latitude 41.2279 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -111.9682 is west of the Prime Meridian.

To find the state, I should recall or look up which states are around these coordinates. I know that:

- The United States has states in various latitudes and longitudes.

- Latitude around 41 is in the northern part of the US, like in the Midwest or West.

- Longitude around -111 is in the western US, possibly Rocky Mountain states.

Let me think about specific states:

- Utah is around there. Salt Lake City, for example, has coordinates approximately 40.7608° N, 111.8910° W.

The given coordinates are 41.2279° N, -111.9682° W.

That's very close to Ogden, Utah, or perhaps somewhere in northern Utah.

I can confirm by knowing that:

- Utah's latitude ranges from about 37° N to 42° N.

- Longitude for Utah is from about -109° W to -114° W.

More precisely, Utah is between approximately 37° and 42° N latitude, and 109° and 114° W longitude.

So, 41.2279° N is within Utah's range, and -111.9682° W is also within Utah's longitude range.

To be more accurate, let's see if it's exactly in Utah.

I recall that the coordinates 41.2279, -111.9682 are for a place in Utah. Specifically, this might be near Ogden or Logan, Utah.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, I believe 41.2279° N, -111.9682° W is in Utah.

Is it possible it's in another state? Wyoming is north of Utah, around 41° to 45° N, but its longitude is more like -104° to -111° W, so -111° is on the western edge, which borders Utah.

Utah's western border is with Nevada, and eastern with Colorado, but northern with Idaho and Wyoming.

The exact point: longitude -111.9682° W is very close to the border.

Utah's border with Wyoming is at approximately 41° N for part of it, but let's clarify.

The 41st parallel is the boundary between Utah and Wyoming in some parts.

Wyoming's southern border is the 41st parallel north, from longitude about -104° to -111° W.

More precisely, Wyoming's southern border is the 41st parallel from the Utah border eastward.

So, for longitude around -111°, the 41st parallel is the border between Utah and Wyoming.

The given latitude is 41.2279° N, which is slightly north of 41° exactly.

41.2279° is greater than 41°, so it's north of 41°.

Wyoming starts at 41° N, so anything north of 41° at that longitude would be in Wyoming.

Is that accurate?

Wyoming's southern border is exactly 41° N from the Utah border to the intersection with the previous surveys.

For longitude -111.9682° W, which is west of that.

I need to be precise.

Upon second thought, the border between Utah and Wyoming is along the 41st parallel north, but only for the eastern part. Wait, no:

Actually, the border between Utah and Wyoming is a straight line along the 41st parallel from the point where it meets the previous border.

More accurately: Wyoming's southern border is the 41st parallel north from its eastern border with Colorado to its western border with Idaho, but Utah is south of that.

Utah's northern border with Wyoming is along the 42nd parallel for part, no.

I think I have it wrong.

Let me clarify: The state of Wyoming is bounded on the south by the 41st parallel north from 104°3' W to 111° W, and then it goes north.

Upon correction: Wyoming's southern border is the 41st parallel north from its eastern border (with Colorado and Nebraska) to the point where it meets Utah, which is at approximately 111° W.

The tripoint between Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming is at 41° N, 109° W or something? No.

Actually, upon standard knowledge: The border between Utah and Wyoming is along the 41st parallel north from longitude 111°02' W to the east, but I need to get this right.

Perhaps it's easier to use a known fact: The coordinates 41.2279 N, 111.9682 W are in Utah.

From my initial recollection, this is in Ogden, Utah, which is in Utah.

Let me confirm with approximate locations:

- Salt Lake City: 40.76 N, 111.89 W

- Ogden, Utah: Approximately 41.22 N, 111.97 W

Yes! Exactly, 41.2279 N, 111.9682 W is very close to Ogden, Utah.

Ogden is in Weber County, Utah.

So, it's definitely in Utah.

Therefore, the state is Utah.

My final answer should be: Utah
