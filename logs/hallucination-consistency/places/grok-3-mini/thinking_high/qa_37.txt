*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 39.9862 and longitude -82.9855 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are given: 39.9862 N and -82.9855 W. The negative longitude indicates it's west of the Prime Meridian, which is typical for the Americas.

I recall that the US has various states, and I need to pinpoint which one this is in. Latitude 39.9862 is around 40 degrees north, which could be in the Midwest or East Coast. Longitude -82.9855 is about 83 degrees west.

I know that:

- New York City is around 40.7 N, 74 W.

- Washington DC is about 38.9 N, 77 W.

- Chicago is around 41.8 N, 87.7 W.

This latitude is similar to Columbus, Ohio. I think Columbus, Ohio is around 40 N and 83 W. Let me confirm that.

Upon thinking, I believe Columbus, Ohio has coordinates approximately 39.9612 N, 82.9988 W. That's very close to the given 39.9862 N and -82.9855 W.

Let me calculate the difference:

- Latitude difference: 39.9862 - 39.9612 = 0.025 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.025 degrees is roughly 2.775 km, so very close.

- Longitude difference: -82.9855 - (-82.9988) = -82.9855 + 82.9988 = 0.0133 degrees. 1 degree longitude at this latitude is about 111 km * cos(40°) ≈ 111 * 0.766 ≈ 85 km, so 0.0133 degrees is about 1.13 km. Again, very close.

So, this coordinate is extremely close to Columbus, Ohio.

Ohio is a state in the US, and Columbus is its capital. Therefore, this place is likely in Ohio.

To be thorough, I should consider if it could be in a neighboring state. The coordinates are very precise and match Columbus closely, so it's probably within Ohio.

Neighboring states:

- To the east is West Virginia and Pennsylvania, but their longitudes are more east (less negative), e.g., Pittsburgh is around -80 W.

- To the west is Indiana, around -86 W or so.

- North is Michigan, but higher latitude.

- South is Kentucky, lower latitude.

Longitude -83 W is central Ohio. For example, the border with Indiana is around -84.8 W, and with Pennsylvania around -80.5 W. So -83 W is well within Ohio.

Latitude 40 N is also within Ohio's range, from about 38.4 N to 41.9 N.

Therefore, I'm confident this is in Ohio.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and clear. I can briefly explain how I determined it, but since the user didn't ask for reasoning, I can keep it concise. However, as an AI, providing a bit of context might be good.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
