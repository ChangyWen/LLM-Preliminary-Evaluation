*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 43.0822 and longitude -89.393 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 43.0822 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -89.393 is in the Western Hemisphere, since it's negative.

I recall that the United States has various states with different latitude and longitude ranges. Latitude 43 is roughly in the northern part of the US, possibly around the Great Lakes or Midwest.

Let me think about specific states:

- Wisconsin has a latitude around 42 to 47 degrees North. Madison, Wisconsin, is a city I know, and I think its coordinates are close to this.

I believe Madison, Wisconsin, is approximately at 43.0722° N, 89.4007° W. The given coordinates are 43.0822 N and -89.393, which is very close to that. -89.393 is the same as 89.393 W.

So, this is likely Madison, Wisconsin.

But the question is for the state, not the city. So, if it's Madison, it's in Wisconsin.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this is indeed in Wisconsin and not near a border.

Longitude -89.393 is west, and latitude 43.0822 is north. Nearby states:

- To the east is Michigan, but Michigan's western part is around longitude -86 or so, which is east of -89.

Longitude increases eastward, so -89 is west of -86. Negative longitude means west, so a more negative number is further west.

Standard longitude: -90 is west of -80, for example.

Wisconsin's longitude range is approximately from -86.9 to -92.9 W.

- Illinois is to the south and east, with Chicago around 41.8 N, 87.6 W.

- Minnesota is to the west, with Minneapolis around 44.9 N, 93.2 W.

- Latitude 43.0822 is between 42 and 44, which is Wisconsin's range.

Specifically, Madison is the capital of Wisconsin, and these coordinates match closely.

I could think about other states: Iowa is south and west, around 42 N, 93 W. Too west.

Michigan is east, around 42-47 N, but longitude around -82 to -90, but eastern part.

Upper Peninsula of Michigan might be close, but longitude is more east, like -84 to -90.

-89.393 is quite west, so likely Wisconsin.

To be precise, I can recall that the coordinates given are very close to Madison, WI.

In fact, looking it up in my knowledge, yes, Madison, Wisconsin is at approximately 43.0722° N, 89.4007° W. The given is 43.0822 and -89.393, which is a slight difference, but probably the same area or very close.

Difference in latitude: 43.0822 - 43.0722 = 0.01 degrees, which is about 1.11 km (since 1 degree latitude is about 111 km).

Longitude difference: -89.393 + 89.4007 ≈ -0.0077 degrees. At latitude 43, 1 degree longitude is about 111 km * cos(43°) ≈ 111 * 0.7317 ≈ 81.2 km, so 0.0077 degrees is about 0.625 km.

So, very close, within 1 km or so, definitely in Madison or nearby.

Therefore, the state is Wisconsin.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, I should structure my response accordingly.

Perhaps I can say something like: Based on the given latitude and longitude, 43.0822 N and -89.393 W, this location is in the state of Wisconsin in the United States.

Final answer: Wisconsin

To make it clear.
