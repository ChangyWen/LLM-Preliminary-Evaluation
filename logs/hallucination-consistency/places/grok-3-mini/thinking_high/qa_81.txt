*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 41.3113 and longitude -72.9246 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate falls into.

Latitude and longitude are given: 41.3113 N and -72.9246 W. The negative longitude indicates it's west of the Prime Meridian, which is typical for the Americas.

I know that the US has various states, and I need to pinpoint which one this is in. Latitude 41.3113 is around 41 degrees north, which could be in the northeastern US. Longitude -72.9246 is about 73 degrees west.

I recall some major cities and their coordinates to compare:

- New York City is around 40.7128 N, -74.0060 W.

- Boston is about 42.3601 N, -71.0589 W.

- Philadelphia is around 39.9526 N, -75.1652 W.

The given latitude is 41.3113, which is higher than NYC's 40.7, so it's north of NYC. Longitude is -72.9246, which is less negative than NYC's -74.0, meaning it's east of NYC because longitude decreases as you go west.

Longitude: -72.9246 vs -74.0060 for NYC. Since -72.9 is greater than -74.0 (because -72.9 is to the east), this point is east of NYC.

East of NYC and north could be Connecticut or perhaps parts of Massachusetts or Rhode Island.

I think Connecticut has coordinates around there. For example, Hartford, CT is approximately 41.7658 N, -72.6734 W. That's close: latitude 41.76 vs 41.31, and longitude -72.67 vs -72.92.

41.31 is a bit south of Hartford. Maybe it's in southern Connecticut.

New Haven, CT is a city I know. I think New Haven is around 41.308 N, -72.928 W. That sounds very close.

Let me verify: latitude 41.308 vs 41.3113, difference is very small. Longitude -72.928 vs -72.9246, also very close. So, this is likely in or near New Haven, Connecticut.

Therefore, the state should be Connecticut.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this coordinate is indeed within Connecticut's borders.

Connecticut's boundaries: it borders New York to the west, Massachusetts to the north, Rhode Island to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south.

Longitude -72.9246 is west of Rhode Island (which is around -71.5) and east of New York (which goes up to about -73.9 for NYC area).

New York's western longitude is more negative, but eastern part near Connecticut is around -73.5 or so for the border.

The border between New York and Connecticut is along the Hudson River and then a straight line. I think longitude around -73.7 is the border in some parts.

But -72.9246 is further east, so definitely in Connecticut.

Latitude 41.3113 is within Connecticut's range, which spans from about 40.95 N to 42.05 N.

Yes, so it's safely within Connecticut.

I could think about other states, but New Jersey is south and west, around 40 N and -74 W. Massachusetts is north, but longitude might not match. Rhode Island is east, but latitude is similar, but longitude -72.9 is west of Rhode Island's -71.5.

Rhode Island's western part is around -71.8, I think. Providence is -71.412, so -72.9 is west of that, so not in Rhode Island.

Thus, confirmed: Connecticut.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, I should structure my response: perhaps explain briefly how I arrived at it, but since the instruction is to reason step by step, I can include that, but keep it concise.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
