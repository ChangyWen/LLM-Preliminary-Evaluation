*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 34.7256 and longitude -92.3577 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 34.7256 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -92.3577 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different latitude and longitude ranges. Longitude -92 is roughly in the central part of the US, and latitude 34 is in the southern part.

Let me think about states around there. Arkansas is in the central south, and its capital is Little Rock. I think Little Rock has coordinates around 34.7 latitude and -92.3 longitude. That sounds familiar.

Confirming: Latitude 34.7256 and longitude -92.3577 â€“ that matches Little Rock, Arkansas. Little Rock is the capital of Arkansas, and I believe those are its approximate coordinates.

To be thorough, I should consider if this could be in another state. Nearby states include Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma. But latitude 34.7 is south of Missouri and north of Louisiana. Longitude -92.3 is west of Tennessee and east of Oklahoma.

Arkansas spans longitudes from about -89.5 to -94.6 and latitudes from 33 to 36.5. So, 34.7256 and -92.3577 fall within Arkansas.

Specifically, this point is very close to the center of Little Rock, which is in Pulaski County, Arkansas.

The user asked for the state, not the city or county. So, the state is Arkansas.

Finally, I need to put the final answer in a new line at the end of my response. So, I'll write a brief explanation and then state the answer clearly.
