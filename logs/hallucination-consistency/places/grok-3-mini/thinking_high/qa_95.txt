*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 39.5497 and longitude -119.8483 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

I know that latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 39.5497 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -119.8483 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western part of the world.

Since the coordinates are in the western hemisphere and likely in North America, I should focus on the United States. The longitude -119 is around the western US. Let me recall some state boundaries.

- California has longitudes from about -114 to -124.

- Nevada is east of California, so its longitudes might be around -114 to -120.

I think Nevada's western border is along the California border, and its longitude ranges roughly from -114° W to -120° W. Longitude increases westward, so -120 is further west than -114.

Standard longitude for US states:

- California: approximately 114° W to 124° W

- Nevada: shares border with California, so about 114° W to 120° W. Nevada's western border is at about 120° W, and it goes east to about 114° W.

Longitude -119.8483 is west, so let's see:

-119.8483 W is between -120 and -119.

Now, latitude 39.5497 N. Latitude 39 is around the middle of the US. For example, Denver, Colorado is at about 39.7 N, and San Francisco is at about 37.7 N.

So latitude 39.5 is a bit north of San Francisco. Reno, Nevada is around there. I think Reno is at approximately 39.5 N and -119.8 W. That sounds familiar.

Let me confirm: I believe Reno, Nevada is very close to these coordinates. Latitude 39.5296 N and longitude -119.8138 W or something like that. It's very close.

So, probably, this is in Nevada.

But to be precise, I should consider if it's exactly on the border or something. Nevada borders California to the west, and the border is along the 120th meridian in some parts, but it's not straight.

The California-Nevada border is not exactly on a longitude line; it follows the Sierra Nevada crest in some areas, but for longitude -119.8483, which is east of 120 W, it should be in Nevada.

Longitude -119.8483 is less negative than -120, so it's east of 120 W. Since west longitudes increase as you go west, -120 W is further west than -119 W.

Clarifying:

- Longitude -120 W is 120 degrees west.

- Longitude -119 W is 119 degrees west, which is east of -120 W because -119 is greater than -120 in numerical value, but in geographic terms, -119 W is east of -120 W.

No: in longitude, more negative means further west. So -120 W is west of -119 W. For example, -120 is smaller than -119, so locations with longitude -120 are west of those with -119.

Standard: longitude increases from east to west in the western hemisphere. So -119 W is east of -120 W.

Let's think numerically: longitude -120 is more west than -119. Because -120 < -119, so -120 W is further west.

For example, Los Angeles is around -118 W, San Francisco is -122 W. San Francisco is approximately -122.4 W, and Reno is east of that.

Reno, Nevada is at about -119.8 W, and latitude 39.5 N.

Yes, so longitude -119.8483 W is around there.

Now, the state boundary: Nevada's western border with California is approximately at 120 W in the north, but it jogs. Actually, for latitude around 39.5 N, the border is close to 120 W, but Reno is well east of that.

Reno is at -119.8 W, and 120 W is the approximate border, so -119.8 is east of -120, so it should be in Nevada.

To confirm, I can think of nearby cities. Latitude 39.5497 N, longitude -119.8483 W.

I know that Lake Tahoe is on the border, around 39 N, and longitude around -120 W. Lake Tahoe straddles the border, with the west side in California and east in Nevada.

But -119.8483 is east of -120, so likely in Nevada.

I can recall that the coordinate given is very close to Reno, which is in Nevada.

Moreover, if I were to use a map or knowledge, this should be Washoe County, Nevada.

But to be thorough, let's consider if it could be in another state. North is Oregon, but Oregon's southern border is around 42 N, so latitude 39.5 is way south of that. South is California, but as established, longitude suggests east of the border.

East is other parts of Nevada.

So, definitely Nevada.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should conclude with the state name.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
The coordinates provided (latitude 39.5497 N, longitude -119.8483 W) are located in the western United States. Based on geographic knowledge, this point is situated near Reno, which is in Washoe County. The longitude and latitude place it east of the California-Nevada border and within the boundaries of Nevada.

To confirm:
- Latitude 39.5497 N is consistent with central Nevada.
- Longitude -119.8483 W is east of the approximate 120 W meridian, which marks part of the California-Nevada border in this region, ensuring it falls within Nevada.

Nevada
