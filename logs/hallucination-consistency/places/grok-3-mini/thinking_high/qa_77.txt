*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 42.9619 and longitude -85.6562 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate falls into.

Latitude and longitude are given: 42.9619 N and -85.6562 W. The negative longitude indicates it's west of the Prime Meridian, which is typical for the Americas.

I know that the US has various states, and I need to recall which ones are around these coordinates. Latitude 42.9619 is roughly in the northern part of the US, and longitude -85.6562 is in the western part.

Let me think about the approximate locations:

- Latitude 42 is around the level of New York, Pennsylvania, but more west.

- Longitude -85 is around the Great Lakes region. For example, Michigan has longitudes around there.

Michigan is known for having parts around the Great Lakes. The western part of Michigan might have longitudes around -85 to -87.

I recall that Grand Rapids, Michigan, is around there. I think Grand Rapids has coordinates close to 42.9634 N, -85.6681 W. That sounds very familiar.

Comparing the given coordinates: 42.9619 and -85.6562. That's extremely close to what I remember for Grand Rapids.

To confirm, I should think about the state boundaries. Michigan's lower peninsula extends to latitudes around 41 to 45 N and longitudes from about -82 to -90 W.

- Eastern Michigan is around -83 (like Detroit), and western Michigan is around -86.

Longitude -85.6562 is west of Detroit. Detroit is about -83.0458, so -85 is further west.

In the US, at latitude 43 N, longitude -85 W, that should be in Michigan.

Could it be in another state? Let's check neighboring states.

- To the south is Indiana and Ohio, but their latitudes are lower. Indiana goes up to about 41.76 N, so 42.96 is north of that.

- To the north is Canada, but the coordinate is in the US.

- To the east is Ohio, but Ohio's western longitude is around -84.8, and latitude up to 41.97 N or so, but 42.96 is higher.

Ohio's northern border is around 41.5 to 42 N, but longitude -85 is west of Ohio. Ohio's western border is around longitude -84.8, so -85.6562 is west of that.

Standard US longitudes:

- New York City is about -74.

- Chicago is about -87.6.

- Detroit is -83.0.

- Grand Rapids, MI, is indeed around -85.6.

I think it's safe to say it's in Michigan.

But to be thorough, let's consider if it could be in Wisconsin or another state.

Wisconsin is further west and north. Wisconsin's eastern part is around longitude -87, and latitude up to 47 N, but at latitude 43 N, longitude -85 would be east of Wisconsin.

Longitude increases westward, so -85 is east of -87.

- Smaller longitude number means further east.

- So -85 is east of -87.

Wisconsin's eastern border is around longitude -86.9 for the eastern part, but actually, Lake Michigan is between.

Michigan's lower peninsula has longitudes from about -82.4 (southeast) to -86.7 (northwest tip), and latitudes from 41.7 to 45.5 N.

Given latitude 42.9619 and longitude -85.6562, it should be within Michigan.

Moreover, I recall that Grand Rapids is very close: looking it up in my knowledge, yes, Grand Rapids, MI, is at approximately 42.9634° N, 85.6681° W. The given is 42.9619 N, -85.6562 W, which is very close, perhaps a nearby point.

So, the state is Michigan.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, I should write a response that explains briefly and then state the answer.

Response structure:

- Acknowledge the query.

- State the location or how I determined it.

- Give the final answer on a new line.

Final answer should be just the state name.
