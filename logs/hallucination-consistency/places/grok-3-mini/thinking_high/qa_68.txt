*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 32.8168 and longitude -79.9687 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 32.8168 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -79.9687 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different coordinates. Latitude around 32-33 degrees north is typically in the southeastern US. For example, South Carolina has latitudes in that range.

Let me think about specific cities or known places. Longitude -79.9687 is close to -80, which is around Charleston, South Carolina. I think Charleston's coordinates are approximately 32.7765 N, -79.9310 W. That's very close to 32.8168 N, -79.9687 W.

Calculating the difference: Latitude difference is 32.8168 - 32.7765 = about 0.0403 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.0403 degrees is roughly 4.47 km. Longitude difference: -79.9687 - (-79.9310) = -0.0377 degrees. At latitude 32, 1 degree longitude is about 85 km (since it decreases towards poles), so 0.0377 degrees is about 3.2 km. So the given coordinates are very close to Charleston, probably within the city or nearby.

Charleston is in South Carolina. So, the state should be South Carolina.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this could be in another state. Nearby states: North Carolina is north, with latitudes starting around 33-36 N, but longitude -79 is more east, so it might overlap, but 32.8 N is definitely south of North Carolina's southern border. North Carolina's southern border is around 33.8 N to 36.5 N, so 32.8 N is below that. Georgia is south, with latitudes from 30-34 N, but longitude -79 is west of Georgia's eastern part. Georgia's longitude ranges from about -81 to -85 W, so -79 is east of that. Longitude increases westward, so -79 is east of -81. Standard: lower longitude numbers are east, higher negative are west.

Clarifying: Longitude -79 is west of the Prime Meridian. The US east coast: Florida is around -80 to -87, Georgia similar, South Carolina is around -78 to -83, North Carolina -75 to -84. Specifically, Charleston, SC is at -79.9, which is within South Carolina.

I can think of other cities: Savannah, GA is at about 32.08 N, -81.09 W, which is further south and west. So 32.8168 N, -79.9687 W is not in Georgia.

What about other states? Alabama is further west, Mississippi, etc., all have different longitudes.

Perhaps it's in a coastal area. Latitude 32.8 N could also be in parts of Louisiana or Texas, but those have longitudes around -90 to -95, which is much west. -79 is specifically east coast.

So, definitely in the eastern US, likely South Carolina.

To be precise, I can recall that the coordinates given are very close to Charleston, SC. In fact, looking it up in my knowledge (as an AI, I have access to general knowledge), Charleston is at 32.7765째 N, 79.9310째 W, and the given is 32.8168째 N, 79.9687째 W. Slight difference, but probably still within the Charleston area or nearby.

Perhaps it's a specific point, like a suburb or something, but the state remains South Carolina.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should conclude with the state name.
