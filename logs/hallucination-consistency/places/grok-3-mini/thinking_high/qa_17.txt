*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.6501 and longitude -73.9496 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

I know that latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 40.6501 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -73.9496 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that New York City is around latitude 40.7 and longitude -74.0. Let me check that. Actually, I think New York City's coordinates are approximately 40.7128 N, -74.0060 W. The given latitude is 40.6501, which is a bit south of that, and longitude -73.9496, which is east of -74.0060 because -73.9496 is less negative.

Longitude: -73.9496 vs. -74.0060. Since -73.9496 is greater than -74.0060 (because -73.9496 is closer to zero), that means it's east of New York City's longitude. In longitude, more negative means further west. So -74.0060 is west of -73.9496. Let's clarify:

- Longitude -74.0060 is more west than -73.9496 because -74.0060 < -73.9496.

Numerically, -74.0060 is less than -73.9496, so -74.0060 is further west. Therefore, -73.9496 is east of -74.0060.

But New York City's longitude is around -74.0060, so -73.9496 is slightly east of that.

Latitude 40.6501 vs. New York City's 40.7128. 40.6501 is less than 40.7128, so it's south of New York City.

So, this point is south and slightly east of central New York City.

Now, New York City is in New York State, but I need to confirm if this coordinate is still within New York State or perhaps in a neighboring state.

New York State borders several states: to the south is New Jersey, Pennsylvania, etc., but specifically, the area south of New York City might be New Jersey.

New York City is on an island and has boroughs. Latitude 40.6501 and longitude -73.9496.

I think this might be in Brooklyn or Queens, which are part of New York City, so still in New York State.

But let me verify the coordinates.

I can think about famous places. For example, JFK Airport is in Queens, New York, and its coordinates are approximately 40.6413 N, -73.7781 W. That's latitude 40.6413, longitude -73.7781.

Given is 40.6501 and -73.9496.

Compare longitude: -73.9496 vs. -73.7781. -73.9496 is more negative, so further west than -73.7781.

-73.7781 is east of -73.9496 because -73.7781 > -73.9496.

Numerically, -73.7781 is greater than -73.9496, so -73.7781 is east of -73.9496? No:

Longitude increases eastward. In the western hemisphere, longitude is negative, and as you go east, the number becomes less negative or positive.

Standard longitude: west longitudes are negative. So, -74 is west of -73.

So, -74.0000 is further west than -73.0000.

Given longitude -73.9496 and JFK's -73.7781.

-73.9496 < -73.7781, so -73.9496 is more negative, thus further west.

JFK Airport is at approximately -73.7781, which is east of -73.9496.

I should look up or recall better.

Perhaps this coordinate is for a specific location.

I can estimate.

New York City area: Manhattan is around 40.7831 N, -73.9712 W for Central Park, I think.

Central Park is about 40.785 N, -73.968 W.

Given latitude 40.6501, which is south of 40.785, so perhaps in Lower Manhattan or Brooklyn.

Longitude -73.9496 is close to -73.968, so similar.

Brooklyn Bridge is around 40.706 N, -73.997 W or something.

I can use the fact that latitude 40.6501 is approximately 40.65.

I know that the border between New York and New Jersey is the Hudson River, but for long island, it's all New York.

Longitude -73.9496 is likely on Long Island, which is part of New York State.

Let me confirm with known points.

For example, Brooklyn, NY, has coordinates around 40.6782 N, -73.9442 W.

Given is 40.6501 N, -73.9496 W.

Very close to Brooklyn.

40.6501 vs. 40.6782, slightly south, and longitude -73.9496 vs. -73.9442, very close.

Probably in Brooklyn, which is in New York City, Kings County, New York State.

To be precise, I should confirm if this exact coordinate is within New York State.

Since the user asked for the state, and this is clearly within the New York metropolitan area, likely New York.

But just to be thorough, let's consider if it could be in another state.

The latitude 40.6501 is north, and longitude -73.9496 is west.

Neighboring states: to the east is the Atlantic Ocean, to the south is the ocean or New Jersey, but New Jersey is west and south.

New Jersey's eastern border is along the Hudson and parts of New York Harbor, but Long Island is entirely in New York.

Longitude -73.9496: I think the western end of Long Island is around -74.0 or so, but Brooklyn is at -73.9 to -74.0.

Actually, upon second thought, I can use online tools or knowledge, but since I'm an AI, I have access to knowledge.

I recall that the coordinate 40.6501, -73.9496 is very close to the Brooklyn area.

In fact, plugging it into a map mentally, it's probably near the Brooklyn Navy Yard or something, but definitely in Brooklyn, NY.

To confirm, the state boundary: New York State includes all of Long Island, and this longitude is within Long Island's range.

Long Island's western tip is near Manhattan, but Brooklyn is part of it.

So, I think it's safe to say it's in New York State.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should conclude with the state name.

Just to be absolutely sure, let's think if there's any chance it's in another state.

For example, if it were slightly west, it might be in New Jersey, but -73.9496 is east of the Hudson River.

Hudson River is around -74.0 or so for Manhattan.

Manhattan's west side is around -74.0, east side -73.9 or so.

Longitude decreases as you go west.

So, Hudson River on the west side of Manhattan is around -74.0, and as you go east, longitude increases (less negative).

So, -73.9496 is quite east, so in Brooklyn, which is east of Manhattan.

Yes, definitely in New York State.

So, the state is New York.

Now, for the response, I should be helpful and perhaps explain a bit, but the user said "please give me your final answer in a new line at the end," so I'll do that.

Final answer: New York
