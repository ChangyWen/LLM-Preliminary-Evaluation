*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 28.4773 and longitude -81.337 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude 28.4773 and longitude -81.337. Latitude is positive, so it's in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude is negative, so it's in the Western Hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different coordinates. Longitude -81 is around the eastern part of the US. For example, Florida is known for having latitudes around 25 to 31 degrees North and longitudes from about -80 to -87 degrees West.

Let me pinpoint this. Latitude 28.4773 N is roughly in the southern part of the US. Longitude -81.337 W is close to -81 degrees.

I think this might be in Florida. Orlando, Florida, is a famous city, and I believe its coordinates are around 28.5 N and -81.4 W. Let me confirm that.

From my knowledge, Orlando's approximate coordinates are 28.5383 N, -81.3787 W. The given coordinates are 28.4773 N, -81.337 W, which is very close to Orlando.

So, if it's near Orlando, it should be in Florida.

But to be precise, I should confirm if this exact point is within Florida's boundaries. Florida extends from about 24.5 N to 31 N latitude and from -80 W to -87.5 W longitude roughly.

Latitude 28.4773 is within that range, and longitude -81.337 is also within Florida's longitude range.

Moreover, -81.337 longitude is east of the Mississippi River, so it's definitely in the eastern US, and given the latitude, it's likely Florida or perhaps Georgia or South Carolina, but let's check.

Georgia's southern part is around 30-31 N, and longitude from -81 to -85. Latitude 28.4773 is south of that; Georgia's lowest latitude is about 30.3 N for the panhandle, but most of Georgia is north of 30 N. Actually, Florida shares a border with Georgia around 30.5 N or so, but 28.4773 is definitely south of that.

Confirming: the Florida-Georgia border is approximately at 30.75 N latitude in some parts, but generally, latitudes below 30 N are in Florida for longitudes around -81.

Longitude -81.337: Florida's east coast is around -80 to -81, and it goes west.

Actually, Orlando is inland, so -81.337 should be well within Florida.

I can think of nearby cities. For example, Kissimmee or other areas near Orlando are in Florida.

To be thorough, I should consider if it could be in another state. For instance, is there any part of another state with similar coordinates? Latitude 28 N is too far south for most states except Florida and parts of Texas, but Texas is at longitudes around -95 to -107, which is much west. -81 is east, so not Texas.

Other states like Alabama or Mississippi have higher latitudes. Alabama's southern tip is around 30 N, longitude -88, which is west.

So, definitely, latitude 28.4773 N and longitude -81.337 W is in Florida.

Now, the user asked for the state, so I should say Florida.

Finally, the response should have the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should be something like: After analyzing the coordinates, the place is located in Florida.

Then, on a new line: Florida

But to make it clear, I can say: The coordinates 28.4773 latitude and -81.337 longitude correspond to a location in the state of Florida.

Final answer:

Florida

I think that's it.
