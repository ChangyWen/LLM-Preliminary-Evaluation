First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.2752 and longitude -76.8843 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

I know that latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 40.2752 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -76.8843 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere, likely in North America.

To find the state, I should recall or look up which states are around these coordinates. I'm familiar with some major cities and their coordinates.

Latitude 40 is around the level of Philadelphia or New York City. New York City is about 40.7128 N, so 40.2752 is a bit south of that. Longitude -76.8843 â€“ New York City is around -74, so this is further west.

I think this might be in Pennsylvania. Harrisburg, the capital of Pennsylvania, is around there. I recall Harrisburg is approximately at 40.2737 N and -76.8844 W. That sounds very close to 40.2752 and -76.8843.

Let me confirm that. If I calculate the difference: latitude difference is 40.2752 - 40.2737 = 0.0015, which is very small. Longitude difference is -76.8843 - (-76.8844) = 0.0001, also very small. So, this is essentially the location of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

To be thorough, I should ensure there are no other states nearby that this could be mistaken for. Latitude 40.2752 is north, so it's not in states like Maryland or Virginia which are south. Longitude -76.8843 is west, so not in states like New Jersey or Delaware which are east.

The coordinates are very precise and match Harrisburg closely. Harrisburg is in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.

Just to double-check, I can think about the state boundaries. Pennsylvania's eastern border is with New Jersey, but at this longitude, it's well within Pennsylvania. The western part of Pennsylvania goes to around -80 longitude, so -76 is towards the east of the state.

Yes, definitely Pennsylvania.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and clear. I can say something like: "Based on the given latitude and longitude, the location is in Pennsylvania."

Then, end with the final answer on a new line.

Final answer: Pennsylvania
