*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 35.1054 and longitude -106.6465 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 35.1054 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -106.6465 is in the Western Hemisphere, since it's negative.

I recall that the United States has various states with different latitude and longitude ranges. I need to figure out which state this falls into.

Let me think about the longitude: -106.6465. That's around the central part of the US. For example, the Rocky Mountains are in that area. States like Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona might have longitudes around there.

Now, latitude 35.1054. That's fairly south in the US. For reference, the southern border of the US is around 25-30 degrees north, and the northern border is up to 49 degrees. So 35 degrees is in the southern half.

Combining both, longitude around -106 and latitude around 35 sounds like it could be in New Mexico or perhaps Texas or Oklahoma.

I think Albuquerque, New Mexico is around there. I remember that Albuquerque has coordinates close to that. Let me verify mentally.

From my knowledge, Albuquerque, NM is approximately at 35.0844° N, 106.6504° W. The given coordinates are 35.1054 N and -106.6465 W. That's very close: 35.1054 vs 35.0844 is a small difference, and -106.6465 vs -106.6504 is also very close. So it's likely in or near Albuquerque.

Albuquerque is in New Mexico. So the state should be New Mexico.

But to be thorough, I should confirm if this exact point is within New Mexico's borders. Given the closeness to Albuquerque's coordinates, it's almost certainly in New Mexico.

I can think about the bounding boxes of states. New Mexico's latitude range is from about 31.3° N to 37° N, and longitude from about -103° W to -109° W. Let me recall:

- Western border: around -109° W

- Eastern border: around -103° W

- Southern border: around 31.3° N

- Northern border: around 37° N

Given latitude 35.1054 is between 31.3 and 37, and longitude -106.6465 is between -103 and -109 (since -106 is west of -103, and -109 is further west, so -106 is within -109 to -103? Wait no.

Longitude decreases as you go west. So -103° W is east of -109° W. New Mexico's longitude range: westernmost is about -109.05° W, easternmost is about -103.00° W. So -106.6465 is between -109 and -103, yes.

Similarly, latitude is fine.

Now, are there any other states nearby? Arizona is west, with longitude more negative, like -109 to -114. Colorado is north, with higher latitude. Texas is east, with longitude less negative.

So, -106.6465 longitude is squarely in New Mexico.

Moreover, the specific coordinates match Albuquerque, which is a city in New Mexico.

Therefore, the state is New Mexico.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, I should structure my response accordingly. Maybe I can say something like: "Based on the given latitude and longitude, the location is in New Mexico."

And then on a new line, just "New Mexico".

To make it clear, I can add a bit of explanation, but keep it concise.

Final answer should be: New Mexico

I should ensure there's no trick here. Is there any possibility it's in a different state? For example, if it's exactly on a border, but given the coordinates, it's not on a border; it's well within New Mexico.

Also, confirm the coordinates: 35.1054 N, -106.6465 W. Yes, Albuquerque is at approx 35.11 N, 106.63 W, very close.

So, I'm confident.
