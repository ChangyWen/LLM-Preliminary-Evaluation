*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 36.7335 and longitude -76.0435 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are given: 36.7335 N and -76.0435 W. The negative longitude indicates it's west of the Prime Meridian, which is typical for the Americas.

I recall that latitude 36.7335 is around 36 degrees north, and longitude -76.0435 is about 76 degrees west. This sounds familiar; I think this might be in the eastern part of the United States.

Let me think about major cities or known locations. Longitude around -76 degrees west could be near the East Coast. For example, Washington D.C. is around 38.9 N, -77 W, which is a bit north and west. New York City is about 40.7 N, -74 W, so this is south of that.

Latitude 36.7335 N – that's similar to Virginia or North Carolina. Virginia's northern border is around 39 N, and it goes down to about 36.5 N at its southern tip. The state of Virginia has latitudes from about 36.5 N to 39.4 N. Longitude -76 W – Virginia's eastern part is along the Chesapeake Bay.

I think this might be Norfolk, Virginia. I recall that Norfolk is a city in Virginia, and its coordinates are approximately 36.85 N, -76.28 W. Let me check that.

The given latitude is 36.7335, which is about 36.73 N, and longitude -76.0435, which is about -76.04 W. That seems close to Norfolk or perhaps another city in the area.

I can use my knowledge of US geography. The coordinate 36.7335 N, -76.0435 W.

- Latitude 36.7335 N: This is in the southeastern US.

- Longitude -76.0435 W: This is on the East Coast, probably around Virginia or North Carolina.

Specific check: The city of Virginia Beach is at approximately 36.85 N, -75.98 W. Let's calculate the difference.

Given: 36.7335 N, -76.0435 W.

Virginia Beach is roughly 36.8529 N, -75.9780 W. That's close but not exact. 36.7335 is a bit south of 36.8529.

36.7335 vs 36.8529 – that's a difference of about 0.1194 degrees in latitude. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.1194 * 111 ≈ 13.25 km south.

Longitude -76.0435 vs -75.9780 – difference of about -0.0655 degrees. 1 degree longitude at this latitude is approximately 111 km * cos(latitude). Cos(36.7335) ≈ cos(37) ≈ 0.7986, so 111 * 0.7986 ≈ 88.6 km per degree. So 0.0655 * 88.6 ≈ 5.8 km west.

So the given point is about 13.25 km south and 5.8 km west of Virginia Beach coordinates I recalled. But Virginia Beach's exact center might be different, but it's in the vicinity.

Perhaps it's another location. Let me think of cities around there.

Chesapeake, Virginia, is nearby. Or perhaps it's in the Hampton Roads area.

I can confirm that this longitude and latitude fall within Virginia.

The state boundaries: Virginia's eastern border is the Atlantic Ocean, and its southern border with North Carolina is at approximately 36.5 N latitude for part of it, but it zigzags.

The Virginia-North Carolina border is not exactly at a latitude line; it's more complex, but generally around 36.5 N.

Upon second thought, latitude 36.7335 N is north of 36.5 N, so it should be in Virginia, not North Carolina.

North Carolina starts around 36.5 N in some parts, but the border isn't straight. However, at longitude -76 W, which is east, the border might be different.

Longitude -76 W is around the Chesapeake Bay area. The Chesapeake Bay is in Virginia and Maryland.

Specifically, at longitude -76 W, latitude 36.7335 N.

I think this is likely in southeastern Virginia.

To be precise, I can recall that the coordinate 36.7335 N, -76.0435 W is very close to the location of Norfolk International Airport or something similar.

Upon thinking, I believe 36.7335 N, -76.0435 W is approximately the location of Norfolk, Virginia.

Let me verify approximate coordinates: Norfolk is about 36.8467 N, -76.2925 W? No, that's not right.

I think I have it wrong. Let me correct myself.

Actually, looking back, I think Virginia Beach is 36.8529 N, -75.9780 W, but the given is 36.7335 N, -76.0435 W.

36.7335 N is less than 36.8529, so south.

Perhaps it's Suffolk or another city.

Maybe it's in North Carolina. Let's check the border.

The Virginia-North Carolina border at that longitude: Longitude -76 W is west of the coast. The coast at that latitude: Virginia's coast is around there.

I can use the fact that I know the area. The Hampton Roads metropolitan area includes Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, etc., all in Virginia.

Let me estimate: Latitude 36.7335 N – for reference, Richmond, VA is about 37.54 N, so this is south of Richmond.

Norfolk is about 36.85 N, as I said.

Perhaps the coordinate is for a specific point. Maybe it's in Chesapeake city.

Chesapeake, VA, has parts that go down to lower latitudes.

Upon better recollection, I think 36.7335 N, -76.0435 W might be close to the city of Portsmouth or something.

But to cut it short, I believe this coordinate is within the state of Virginia.

To confirm, let's think about adjacent states. West is towards longitude -77 W, which could be North Carolina or Virginia interior.

But at latitude 36.73 N, longitude -76.04 W, it's definitely on the East Coast side.

Another way: I can think of the time zone or known locations.

I recall that the coordinate 36.7335 N, -76.0435 W is very close to the location of the Great Dismal Swamp or areas in southeastern Virginia.

But practically, looking it up in my mind, I think it's in Virginia.

Finally, I should conclude that it's in Virginia.

The user asked for the state, and assuming it's in the US, which it likely is, given the coordinates.

Just to be thorough, is there any chance it's in another country? Latitude 36.7335 N is north, so not in the southern hemisphere, and longitude -76 W is in the Americas. Specifically, it could be in the US or Canada, but latitude 36.7 N is too south for Canada; Canada starts around 42-45 N in the east. So definitely US.

Now, states around there: Virginia, North Carolina, etc.

I think it's safe to say Virginia.

So, my final answer is Virginia.
