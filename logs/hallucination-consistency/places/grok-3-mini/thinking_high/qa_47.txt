*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 35.1087 and longitude -89.9663 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate falls into.

Latitude and longitude are given: 35.1087 N and -89.9663 W. The negative longitude indicates it's west of the Prime Meridian, which is typical for the Americas.

I know that latitude 35 is roughly in the southern US, and longitude around -90 is in the central US. Let me recall the states in that area.

Longitude -90 is approximately the Mississippi River. Memphis, Tennessee, is around there. I think Memphis has coordinates close to 35.1495 N, -90.0489 W. Let me compare:

Given: 35.1087 N, -89.9663 W

Memphis: Approximately 35.1495 N, -90.0489 W

The given latitude is a bit south of Memphis's typical latitude, and longitude is a bit east (since -89.9663 is less negative than -90.0489).

Longitude -89.9663 is west, but less negative means closer to the Prime Meridian, so actually east of -90. Let's clarify:

- A more negative longitude means further west. So -90.0489 is west of -89.9663. No:

Longitude increases westward when negative. Standard is: longitude west is negative, so -90 is further west than -89.

-89.9663 is approximately -90 + 0.0337, so it's slightly east of -90.

Typically, longitude -90 is the Mississippi River. Memphis is on the river, so around -90.

Given longitude -89.9663 is about -90, very close.

Latitude 35.1087 is close to 35.1, while Memphis is 35.15, so slightly south.

But Memphis is in Tennessee. Is this point still in Tennessee?

I should use a more precise way. I can think about state boundaries.

Tennessee's western border is the Mississippi River, around longitude -90.

Arkansas is west of the river, so longitudes more negative, like -90.5 or so.

Mississippi state is south, but longitude similar.

Let's think about the coordinates.

I can recall that the point might be in Memphis or nearby.

Perhaps it's in Tennessee.

But let's confirm the exact location.

I know that latitude 35 and longitude -90 is Memphis, TN.

The given point is 35.1087, -89.9663.

Difference in latitude: 35.1495 - 35.1087 = 0.0408 degrees south.

Difference in longitude: -90.0489 - (-89.9663) = -90.0489 + 89.9663 = -0.0826, so about 0.0826 degrees west? No:

Longitude of given point is -89.9663, Memphis is -90.0489.

So -89.9663 - (-90.0489) = -89.9663 + 90.0489 = 0.0826 degrees.

Since longitude is measured west, a higher number (less negative) means east.

So the given point is 0.0826 degrees east and 0.0408 degrees south of Memphis center.

Memphis is in Tennessee, and the city spans a bit, but the coordinates might still be within Tennessee.

Tennessee's border with Arkansas is the Mississippi River, so west of longitude -90 approximately.

Longitude -90 is the river, but it meanders.

At latitude 35.1, what is the exact border.

Perhaps this point is east of the river, so in Tennessee.

Longitude -89.9663 is east of -90, since -89.9663 > -90.

-89.9663 is greater than -90, so it's east of the 90th meridian west.

The Mississippi River is around -90, but slightly varies.

In Memphis area, the river is west of downtown Memphis.

Downtown Memphis is east of the river, in Tennessee, and the river is the border.

So longitude for Memphis city is around -90, but specific points.

Perhaps I can estimate.

I know that Graceland, Elvis's home, is in Memphis, and its coordinates are approximately 35.0427 N, -89.9787 W or something. Let me think.

Upon second thought, I should assume it's in Tennessee.

But to be precise, let's think about nearby cities.

Latitude 35.1087, longitude -89.9663.

Convert to decimal degrees, it's already given.

Each degree of latitude is about 111 km, so 0.1 degree is 11.1 km.

Longitude varies, at latitude 35, cosine(35) ≈ 0.8192, so 1 degree longitude is about 111 * 0.8192 ≈ 90.9 km.

So the point is at 35.1087 N, -89.9663 W.

Compared to Memphis center 35.1495 N, -90.0489 W.

Delta lat = 35.1495 - 35.1087 = 0.0408 deg south, so about 0.0408 * 111 ≈ 4.53 km south.

Delta long = -90.0489 - (-89.9663) = -90.0489 + 89.9663 = -0.0826 deg.

Since longitude, delta long negative means west? No.

Longitude of Memphis is -90.0489, given is -89.9663.

So given longitude is larger (less negative), so east.

Delta long = -89.9663 - (-90.0489) = +0.0826 deg east.

At lat 35, 0.0826 deg long * 90.9 km/deg ≈ 7.51 km east.

So the point is about 4.53 km south and 7.51 km east of Memphis center.

Memphis center is in Tennessee, and since it's east, it's likely still in Tennessee, as the river is west.

The Mississippi River forms the western border, so points east of the river are in Tennessee.

Longitude -90 is roughly the river, but -89.9663 is east of -90, so definitely east of the river.

-89.9663 is greater than -90, so yes, east.

For example, -90.000 is on the meridian, but the river meanders, but in Memphis area, downtown is at about -90.05 or so, but east of that is still TN.

Perhaps this coordinate is for a specific place in Memphis.

I think it's safe to say it's in Tennessee.

But let's make sure there's no mistake.

Is there any chance it's in another state? Mississippi state is south, but latitude 35.1 is north of Mississippi's northern border.

Mississippi state is south of Tennessee, so latitude higher means north.

Tennessee's southern border is with Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia.

Tennessee spans from about lat 35 to 36.5 or so.

Memphis is at lat 35.1, which is the southwestern corner of Tennessee.

South of that is Mississippi state.

The border between Tennessee and Mississippi is the state line, which I think is along latitude or something? No, it's irregular.

Actually, the western part, the border with Mississippi is along the Mississippi River for part, but no.

Tennessee's western border is with Arkansas and Missouri along the Mississippi River, and southern border with Mississippi, Georgia, etc.

Specifically, Memphis is in Tennessee, and just south is Mississippi.

The state line between Tennessee and Mississippi is approximately at latitude 35 degrees or something? I think it's not a straight line.

Upon recall, the border is the 35th parallel north for part of it, but I'm not sure.

I think the border between Tennessee and Mississippi is along the Mississippi River for the western part? No.

Tennessee's southern border with Mississippi is a straight line, I think along latitude 35 degrees for some part.

Upon thinking, I believe the border between Tennessee and the states to the south is not exactly on latitude, but in the west, near Memphis, the border might be close.

Memphis is at lat 35.1, and Mississippi starts south of that.

For example, Southaven, Mississippi, is just south of Memphis, with latitude around 34.99 or something.

Memphis lat 35.15, Southaven might be 34.95 or so.

Standard knowledge: Memphis, TN is at approx 35.1 N, and the state line is south of that.

Upon better recall, the Tennessee-Mississippi border in that area is approximately at latitude 35 degrees, but Memphis is north of 35.

Latitude 35 degrees north is the border in some parts.

I think the 35th parallel is the border between Tennessee and Mississippi in the western part.

Yes, I believe so. The border is set at 35 degrees north latitude.

So, latitude 35.0000 N is the border.

Given latitude is 35.1087 N, which is north of 35.0000, so it should be in Tennessee.

35.1087 is greater than 35.0000, so north of the 35th parallel.

If the border is at 35 N, then north of it is Tennessee, south is Mississippi.

Yes.

Now, confirm the longitude. Longitude -89.9663 W.

The border should be consistent across longitudes in that area, I think it's a straight line at 35 N.

So, any point with lat > 35.0000 N and west longitude around there should be in Tennessee, as long as it's east of the Mississippi River.

The Mississippi River is the western border, so for longitude, it needs to be east of the river.

The river's longitude varies, but at lat 35.1, the river is around -90.1 or something.

But given longitude -89.9663 is about -90, but as calculated earlier, it's east of Memphis center, which is east of the river.

So, definitely in Tennessee.

To be thorough, I can think about the exact coordinate.

Perhaps this is the coordinate for Memphis International Airport or something.

Upon quick search in my mind, I think Memphis airport is at approximately 35.0424 N, -89.9767 W or close.

Given is 35.1087 N, -89.9663 W.

35.1087 is higher than 35.0424, so north.

Perhaps it's downtown Memphis.

Downtown Memphis is around 35.149, as I said.

35.1087 is between 35.042 and 35.149, so still within the metro area.

All within Shelby County, Tennessee.

So, I think it's safe to say Tennessee.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should conclude with the state name.

Also, ensure it's correct.

Is there any possibility it's in another state? For example, if it's very close to the border.

But lat 35.1087 is well north of 35.0000, since 35.1087 - 35.0000 = 0.1087 degrees, which is about 12 km north, so definitely in Tennessee.

Longitude is fine.

So, the state is Tennessee.
