*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 45.5371 and longitude -122.65 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude 45.5371 and longitude -122.65. Latitude is north-south, and longitude is east-west. Negative longitude means it's west of the Prime Meridian, so in the Western Hemisphere.

I know that the United States has various states, and I need to pinpoint which one this is in. Latitude around 45 degrees is in the northern part of the US. For example, the 45th parallel runs through states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, and up to Oregon and Washington.

Longitude -122.65 is around 122 degrees west. I recall that the Pacific Northwest has longitudes around there. Seattle, Washington, is around 47.6 N latitude and 122.3 W longitude. Let me think about Portland, Oregon. I think Portland is close to latitude 45.5 and longitude -122.6.

Yes, I believe Portland, Oregon, has coordinates approximately 45.52 N and 122.68 W. Let me confirm that in my knowledge.

From what I remember:

- Portland, Oregon: Latitude about 45.52, Longitude about -122.68.

The given coordinates are 45.5371 N and -122.65 W. That's very close to Portland's coordinates.

So, this should be in Oregon.

But I need to make sure it's not in Washington or another state. The Columbia River forms the border between Oregon and Washington. Portland is right on that border, but most of Portland is in Oregon.

Latitude 45.5371 is slightly north of 45.52, but still around the same area. Longitude -122.65 is very close.

I can think about the state boundaries. The state of Oregon includes Portland, and Washington is north of the Columbia River.

Portland itself is mostly in Oregon, with a small part in Washington, but the coordinates given are likely within Oregon.

To be precise, I should confirm if this exact point is in Oregon.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll use my knowledge. I know that the city of Portland is in Oregon, and these coordinates match closely.

Moreover, longitude -122.65 is west, and latitude 45.5371 is north, placing it in the Pacific Northwest.

Other states: California is further south, around 34-42 N, so too south. Idaho is east, around -114 to -117 W. Washington state goes up to about 49 N, but at longitude -122, it's the western part.

Actually, at longitude -122.65, the border between Oregon and Washington is the Columbia River, which runs roughly east-west.

Portland is situated where the Willamette River meets the Columbia, and it's in Oregon.

I can recall that the coordinates for Portland International Airport or something similar might be close.

But based on standard knowledge, this is in Oregon.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be clear, and end with the state name.

Final answer: Oregon

To be thorough, let's make sure there's no trick. Is there any chance it's in Washington? For example, if it's north of the Columbia River.

But latitude 45.5371: the 45th parallel is the border in some parts, but in this longitude, the border is the Columbia River, not exactly the 45th parallel.

Actually, the 49th parallel is the US-Canada border, and the 45th is not a state border here.

In Oregon-Washington, the border is the Columbia River up to a point, and then it follows the 46th parallel or something? No, I think the Columbia River is the border until it meets the Snake River, but in the Portland area, it's the Columbia River.

Portland is south of the Columbia River? No, Portland is on the Columbia River, but the city is in Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, is across the river.

Latitude-wise, Portland is around 45.5 N, and the Columbia River at that point is at similar latitude.

But typically, coordinates given for Portland refer to Oregon.

Moreover, looking at the exact coordinates: 45.5371 N, -122.65 W.

I can think of it as approximately the location of downtown Portland or nearby.

Yes, I'm confident it's in Oregon.

So, my response should be: After reasoning, the place is located in Oregon.

And then, in a new line, just "Oregon".
