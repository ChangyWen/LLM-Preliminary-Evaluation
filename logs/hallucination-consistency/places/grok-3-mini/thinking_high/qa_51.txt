*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 35.4676 and longitude -97.5136 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 35.4676 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -97.5136 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different latitude and longitude ranges. I need to figure out which state this falls into.

Let me think about the longitude: -97.5136. This is around the central part of the US. For example, the Mississippi River is around -90, so -97 is further west, probably in the Great Plains or Midwest.

Now, latitude 35.4676. That's in the southern part of the US. For reference, the southern states like Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas are around there.

I think these coordinates might be for Oklahoma City. I've heard that Oklahoma City is around 35.4676 N and 97.5136 W. Let me confirm that.

Upon thinking, yes, I believe 35.4676, -97.5136 is the approximate location of Oklahoma City, which is in Oklahoma.

To be thorough, I should consider if it could be in another state. Let's check the boundaries.

Oklahoma is bordered by Texas to the south, Arkansas and Missouri to the east, Kansas and Colorado to the north, and New Mexico and Texas to the west. Its latitude range is roughly from 33.6° N to 37° N, and longitude from about -94.43° W to -103° W.

- Latitude 35.4676 is within 33.6 to 37, so that's fine.

- Longitude -97.5136: Oklahoma's eastern border is around -94.43, and western is -103, so -97.5136 is within that range.

Now, is there any other state that this could be in? For example, Texas is south of Oklahoma, with latitudes from 25.8° N to 36.5° N, and longitudes from -93.5° W to -106.6° W. So latitude 35.4676 could be in Texas, but longitude -97.5136: Texas's eastern part is around -94, but -97 is more central-west. The panhandle of Texas might overlap, but let's see.

Texas's northern border with Oklahoma is around latitude 36.5° N, but Oklahoma extends to 37° N. The coordinates given are 35.4676, which is south of that, so it should be within Oklahoma.

Moreover, the specific point 35.4676, -97.5136 is very close to the center of Oklahoma City, which is definitely in Oklahoma.

I could think about adjacent states:

- Kansas is north, latitudes around 37° N and up, so 35.4676 is too south.

- Arkansas is east, longitudes around -94° W, so -97.5136 is too west.

- Texas is south, but as mentioned, the border is such that this longitude is in Oklahoma.

So, it's safe to say it's in Oklahoma.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "Based on the given latitude and longitude, the location is in the state of Oklahoma."

Then, end with the answer on a new line.

Final answer should be just the state name, I think. The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So probably something like:

Final answer: Oklahoma

Yes.

I should make sure I'm not assuming too much. Is there any chance it's not in the US? Latitude 35.4676 and longitude -97.5136 are definitely in North America, and specifically in the US, as the coordinates fall within the continental US.

No issues there.
