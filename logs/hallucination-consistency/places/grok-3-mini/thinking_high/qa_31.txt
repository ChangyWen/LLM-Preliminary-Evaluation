*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 39.1413 and longitude -84.506 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate falls into.

Latitude and longitude are given: 39.1413 N and -84.506 W. The negative longitude indicates it's west of the Prime Meridian, which is typical for the Americas.

I know that latitude 39.1413 is around 39 degrees north, and longitude -84.506 is about 84.5 degrees west. This sounds familiar; I think this might be in the Midwest or eastern US.

I recall that Cincinnati, Ohio, is around there. Let me confirm: Cincinnati is approximately at 39.1° N, 84.5° W. Yeah, that matches closely.

To be precise, I should verify if this is indeed in Ohio or perhaps a neighboring state. Longitude -84.506 is west, and latitude 39.1413 is north.

Considering the states around that area:

- Ohio is bordered by Kentucky to the south, Indiana to the west, and so on.

The Ohio River forms the border between Ohio and Kentucky. Cincinnati is right on that border.

If the coordinate is exactly at 39.1413, -84.506, I need to know if this is north or south of the river.

From memory, Cincinnati's downtown is in Ohio, but some areas might be close to Kentucky.

I can think about the approximate coordinates:

- Cincinnati, OH: about 39.1031° N, 84.5120° W

The given latitude is 39.1413, which is a bit higher (more north) than 39.1031.

39.1413 vs 39.1031 – 39.1413 is north of 39.1031.

Standard Cincinnati coordinates are around 39.10 N, but let's calculate the difference.

39.1413 - 39.1031 = about 0.0382 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.0382 * 111 ≈ 4.24 km north.

So, 4.24 km north of typical Cincinnati center.

But Cincinnati spans a area, and the Ohio River is the border.

Perhaps this coordinate is still in Ohio.

Longitude is -84.506, similar to -84.5120, so very close.

I think the coordinate 39.1413, -84.506 might be in Ohio, possibly in a suburb or something.

To be accurate, I should consider if it's across the river.

The Ohio River roughly follows latitude, but it's not straight.

I can recall that the border between Ohio and Kentucky is the Ohio River, and Cincinnati is on the north bank, so in Ohio.

A point at lat 39.1413, long -84.506 – let's see if it's north of the river.

Typical river latitude in Cincinnati area is around 39.09 to 39.11 or so, but I'm not sure.

Perhaps I can use general knowledge.

I know that latitude 39 N crosses several states: from west to east, it goes through California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, etc.

But longitude -84.5 W is specifically in the east.

Longitude -84 is around the area of Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana.

- Specific longitudes:

- New York City is around -74, Washington DC -77, Chicago -87, so -84 is between DC and Chicago, so Midwest.

States at longitude -84:

- Around -84, it's Ohio and Kentucky.

For example, Columbus, OH is at about -83, Cincinnati is further west at -84.5.

Yes.

Now, to pinpoint: latitude 39.1413 N.

In Cincinnati, the city is mostly between lat 39.0 and 39.2 or so.

I think 39.1413 is within the Cincinnati metropolitan area, likely in Ohio.

But to be precise, let's think about the border.

The Ohio-Kentucky border is the Ohio River. The river's path: in Cincinnati, it flows from east to west, so latitude decreases slightly as you go west, but roughly around 39.1 N.

Upon second thought, a quick mental search: I believe the coordinate given is very close to Cincinnati, and since latitude 39.1413 is slightly north, it might be in Ohio.

Perhaps it's in a specific location.

I can consider that Covington, Kentucky, is across the river, which might have similar longitude but slightly south latitude.

Covington, KY is at about 39.083, -84.508 or something. Let's estimate.

Typical Covington is south of the river, so lower latitude.

39.083 vs 39.1413 – 39.1413 is higher, so more north, likely in Ohio.

Difference: 39.1413 - 39.083 = 0.0583 degrees, about 6.5 km north, which would place it well north of the river.

So, probably in Ohio.

To confirm, I can think of other cities.

For example, Dayton, OH is further north at about 39.76 N, so 39.14 is south of that.

Hamilton, OH is northwest of Cincinnati, around 39.3 N or something. Cincinnati is 39.1, Hamilton might be 39.4 or so.

Actually, Hamilton, OH is at about 39.39 N, -84.56 W, so latitude 39.39 is higher than 39.14.

39.39 vs 39.14 – 39.14 is lower latitude? No, latitude increases north, so 39.14 is south of 39.39.

Standard: higher latitude number is further north.

39.1413 is approximately 39.14, and Cincinnati center is 39.10, so 39.14 is north of 39.10.

Hamilton, OH is at about 39.399 N, which is further north.

But longitude -84.506 is very close to Cincinnati's longitude.

Cincinnati long is -84.512, so almost the same.

So, a point at lat 39.1413, long -84.506 is likely just north of downtown Cincinnati, still within Ohio.

Perhaps in a neighborhood like Clifton or something, but definitely in Ohio.

To be thorough, I should consider if it could be in Indiana or Kentucky.

Indiana is west, longitude more negative, like -85 or so for Indianapolis.

Indianapolis is -86.16, so -84.5 is east of that.

Kentucky is south, but across the river.

The closest point in Kentucky would have lower latitude.

So, I think it's safe to say it's in Ohio.

Therefore, the state is Ohio.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, I'll structure my response.

I should probably just give the answer, but since it's a reasoning exercise, I'll keep it concise.

Final answer: Ohio

But to make sure, is there any chance it's in another state?

What about the exact border? Is there a possibility it's on the river or something?

But latitude 39.1413 is likely north of the river.

I can recall that the Ohio River at Cincinnati is approximately at latitude 39.09 to 39.11, so 39.1413 is about 0.05 degrees north, which is roughly 5.5 km north, and Cincinnati extends north, so yes.

So, I'm confident.
