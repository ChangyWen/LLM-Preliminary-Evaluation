*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 32.7935 and longitude -96.7667 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 32.7935 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -96.7667 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different latitude and longitude ranges. I need to think about which state this might be in.

Longitude -96.7667 is around the central part of the US. For example, the Mississippi River is around -90, so -96 is further west. That puts it in the central or western states.

Latitude 32.7935 is relatively low, so it's in the southern part of the US. States like Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas are in that latitude range.

I think Dallas, Texas is around there. I remember Dallas has coordinates close to 32.7767 latitude and -96.7970 longitude or something similar. Let me verify that.

Upon thinking, 32.7935 latitude and -96.7667 longitude sounds very close to Dallas, Texas. I believe Dallas is approximately at 32.7767 N, 96.7970 W. Wait, that's slightly different, but close.

Let me calculate the difference: Given latitude is 32.7935, Dallas is about 32.7767, so difference is about 0.0168 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.0168 * 111 ≈ 1.86 km, so very close.

Longitude: Given -96.7667, Dallas -96.7970, difference is about 0.0303 degrees. 1 degree longitude at that latitude is about 111 km * cos(latitude). Cos(32.8) is roughly cos(33) ≈ 0.838, so 111 * 0.838 ≈ 93 km, then 0.0303 * 93 ≈ 2.82 km. So again, very close, within 3 km.

So, this is likely in Dallas, Texas.

But to be precise, I should confirm if this exact coordinate is within Texas. Since Dallas is in Texas, and the coordinates are very close, it's probably in Texas.

I know that longitude -96 is the boundary between Oklahoma and Texas in some parts, but -96.7667 is west, so likely Texas.

The 100th meridian is around -100, so -96 is east of that. Texas spans from about -93 to -107 longitude, and latitude from 26 to 36 N.

Yes, 32.7935 is within Texas's latitude range.

To be thorough, I should consider if it could be in another state. For example, Louisiana is east, around -92 to -94, so longitude -96.7667 is too west for Louisiana.

Arkansas is around -94 to -90, still east.

Oklahoma is west of Arkansas, longitude from -94.5 to -103, latitude 33.5 to 37 N or so. Latitude 32.7935 is a bit south for Oklahoma; Oklahoma's southern border is around 34 N, I think. Wait, no, Oklahoma's southern part goes down to about 33.6 N, I believe. Let me think.

Actually, the Red River forms the border, and Texas extends south. Latitude 32.7935 is below 33, and Oklahoma's southernmost point is around 33.6 N, so 32.7935 is south of that, so it should be in Texas.

Moreover, the longitude -96.7667: the border between Texas and Oklahoma along the Red River is around -95 to -97 or so, but specifically, at latitude 32.7935, which is south, it's definitely in Texas.

I can recall that Dallas is a major city in Texas, and these coordinates match.

So, the state is Texas.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So I should structure my response accordingly.
