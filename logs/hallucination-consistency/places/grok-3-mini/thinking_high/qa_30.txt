*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.4397 and longitude -79.9763 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 40.4397 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -79.9763 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different coordinates. Longitude around -80 is typically in the eastern part of the US. Latitude around 40 is common for states like Pennsylvania, New York, or Ohio.

Let me think about specific cities or known places. Latitude 40.4397 and longitude -79.9763 sound familiar. I think that's close to Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is in Pennsylvania, and I believe its coordinates are approximately 40.4406 N, 79.9959 W. That's very close to the given coordinates.

Confirming: 40.4397 vs. 40.4406 is almost identical, and -79.9763 vs. -79.9959 is also very close. Probably a slight variation, but it's definitely Pittsburgh or very near it.

Pittsburgh is in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. So, the state should be Pennsylvania.

To be thorough, I should ensure there are no other states nearby that could have similar coordinates. For example, West Virginia is south of Pennsylvania, and its latitudes might be lower. Ohio is west, but longitude -79 is east of Ohio's typical longitudes. New York is north, but longitude might not match.

Rough estimates:

- Pennsylvania: latitudes from about 39.7 to 42.3 N, longitudes from -74.7 to -80.5 W.

- Specifically, Pittsburgh is at about 40.44 N, 80.00 W, which matches.

I could think about the coordinate system. Longitude -79.9763 is very close to -80, which is the approximate longitude for Pittsburgh.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll stick to my knowledge. I'm confident it's Pittsburgh, PA.

The user asked for the state, not the city. So, even if it's exactly on the border, but given the coordinates, it's squarely in Pennsylvania.

Finally, the response should end with the answer on a new line. So, I'll write my reasoning and then put the state name.

Answer: Pennsylvania
