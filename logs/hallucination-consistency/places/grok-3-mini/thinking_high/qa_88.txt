*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 33.4015 and longitude -111.7178 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 33.4015 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -111.7178 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different latitude and longitude ranges. Longitude -111 is around the western part of the US. Let me think about the states in that area.

Arizona has longitudes around -109 to -114. Phoenix, Arizona, is a major city, and I think its coordinates are close to this. Let me verify that.

I remember Phoenix, Arizona, has coordinates approximately 33.4484° N, 112.0740° W. The given latitude is 33.4015 and longitude -111.7178. That's close but not exactly the same. Longitude -111.7178 is east of -112.0740, since -111 is less negative.

Longitude decreases as you go west, so -112 is west of -111. Negative longitude means west, so -111.7178 is actually east of -112.0740 because -111.7178 is greater than -112.0740 (since -111.7178 > -112.0740).

Let's calculate the difference. Phoenix is at about -112.0740, and the given is -111.7178. The difference is -111.7178 - (-112.0740) = -111.7178 + 112.0740 = 0.3562 degrees east. Since 1 degree of longitude is about 111 km at the equator, but less at higher latitudes, roughly 0.3562 * 111 km ≈ 39.5 km, so about 40 km east of Phoenix.

Phoenix is in Arizona, so this point might still be in Arizona. But I need to confirm the exact location.

I can think about the state boundaries. Arizona borders several states: Utah to the north, New Mexico to the east, Nevada and California to the west, and Mexico to the south.

The latitude 33.4015 is around the southern part of Arizona. Phoenix is at about 33.45, so similar latitude.

Longitude -111.7178: Arizona's eastern border is with New Mexico at around longitude -109, and western border with California and Nevada at around -114. So -111.7178 is within Arizona's longitude range.

To be precise, I should check if it's not crossing into another state. For example, is there a state boundary at that longitude?

Arizona's boundaries: the western border is with California along the Colorado River, which might not be a straight line, but generally, longitudes from about -114.8 to -109.045.

More accurately, Arizona's westernmost point is around -114.8, easternmost at -109.045 with New Mexico.

So -111.7178 is between -114.8 and -109.045, so definitely within Arizona longitudinally.

Now latitudinally, Arizona goes from about 31.332 to 37.004 degrees north. Latitude 33.4015 is within that, as Phoenix is at 33.45.

But to be thorough, could it be in a neighboring state? North is Utah, which starts around latitude 37, so no. South is Mexico, but latitude 33.4 is north of the border. The US-Mexico border in Arizona is around latitude 31.3 to 32.5 or so, but actually, it varies. The southernmost point of Arizona is about 31.33N, so 33.4 is well north.

East is New Mexico, but New Mexico's western border is at longitude -109.048, approximately. The given longitude is -111.7178, which is west of -109.048 (since -111.7178 < -109.048), so it's west of the Arizona-New Mexico border, thus in Arizona.

West is California, but California's eastern border with Arizona is along the Colorado River, which is around longitude -114. something. The border between Arizona and California is at longitude -114. something, but it's not a straight line; it's the Colorado River. However, longitude -114 is west of -111.7178.

Longitude increases eastward in negative values? No: longitude -114 is more west than -111, because -114 < -111.

Numerically, -114 is less than -111, so points with longitude -114 are west of points with -111.

The Arizona-California border is approximately at longitude -114.5 or so, but it follows the river. Generally, longitudes west of -114 are in California, east are in Arizona.

Standard: longitude -114 is about the border. For example, Yuma, Arizona is at around -114.6, and points east are Arizona.

Given longitude -111.7178 is much east of -114, so definitely in Arizona.

Moreover, the coordinates 33.4015, -111.7178 sound familiar. I think this might be near Mesa or something in Arizona. Let me recall: Mesa, Arizona is a city near Phoenix.

Upon thinking, I believe these coordinates are for a place in Arizona. Perhaps I can estimate: latitude 33.4015 is slightly south of Phoenix's 33.4484, and longitude -111.7178 is east of Phoenix's -112.0740.

Difference in longitude: as I calculated, about 0.3562 degrees. At latitude 33, the distance per degree longitude is cos(33°) * 111 km ≈ cos(33) is about 0.8387, times 111 ≈ 93 km per degree. So 0.3562 * 93 ≈ 33 km east.

Latitude difference: 33.4484 - 33.4015 = 0.0469 degrees south. Distance per degree latitude is about 111 km, so 0.0469 * 111 ≈ 5.2 km south.

So approximately 33 km east and 5 km south of Phoenix city center. Phoenix metropolitan area includes cities like Tempe, Mesa, etc. Mesa is east of Phoenix.

I think Mesa, Arizona has coordinates around 33.4152° N, 111.8310° W. 111.8310 W is -111.8310.

Given is -111.7178, which is less negative, so east of that.

-111.7178 vs -111.8310: -111.7178 > -111.8310, so east.

Difference: -111.7178 - (-111.8310) = 0.1132 degrees east. At lat 33, about 0.1132 * 93 ≈ 10.5 km east.

And latitude 33.4015 vs Mesa's 33.4152, difference 0.0137 degrees south, about 1.5 km south.

So roughly near Mesa or perhaps another city.

But importantly, it's still within Arizona.

To confirm, I can think that the entire area around Phoenix is in Maricopa County, Arizona.

So, the state is Arizona.

The user asked for the state, not the city or county.

Just to be absolutely sure, is there any chance it's in another state? For example, if it were very close to a border, but as per calculations, it's comfortably within Arizona.

I could recall that latitude 33.4 and longitude -111.7 is definitely Arizona.

Finally, the user said to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should end with the state name on a new line.
