*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.7834 and longitude -73.9662 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 40.7834 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -73.9662 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the Western Hemisphere.

I recall that New York City is around latitude 40 and longitude -74. Let me think about specific coordinates. I know that Central Park in New York City is approximately at 40.785, -73.968. That sounds very close to 40.7834, -73.9662.

Let me double-check that. Yes, looking at my knowledge, the coordinates given are very close to those of the Empire State Building or somewhere in Manhattan. Specifically, 40.7834 N, 73.9662 W is likely in New York City.

Now, New York City is in the state of New York. But I should confirm if this exact point is within the state boundaries. Given that it's in Manhattan, which is part of New York state, it should be fine.

To be thorough, let's consider if this could be in another state. Latitude 40.7834 is around the same as Philadelphia or other cities, but longitude -73.9662 is distinctly east coast, and -73 is specific to the New York area. For example, Philadelphia is around -75 longitude, which is further west. So, no, it's not in Pennsylvania or any other state.

I can think about the approximate locations:

- New York City: 40.7128 N, -74.0060 W (that's for the center, but Manhattan varies).

The given coordinates: 40.7834 N, -73.9662 W. Comparing to known points:

- Central Park: about 40.785 N, -73.968 W. Yes, very close.

- So, this is likely in Upper Manhattan or nearby.

Therefore, the state is New York.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and clear. I can briefly explain how I arrived at the answer, but since the user didn't ask for reasoning, I can keep it concise. However, as an AI, it's good to provide a bit of context.

Final answer should be just the state name on a new line.

So, response structure:

- Optionally, a short explanation.

- Then, the answer on a new line.

Answer: New York
