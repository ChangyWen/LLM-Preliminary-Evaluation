*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.7498 and longitude -73.7976 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 40.7498 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -73.7976 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the Western Hemisphere.

I recall that New York City has coordinates around 40.7128 latitude and -74.0060 longitude. Let me compare:

- Given latitude: 40.7498

- Given longitude: -73.7976

New York's latitude is about 40.7128, which is close but a bit lower. Longitude -74.0060 is more west than -73.7976. Negative longitude means west, so -74.0060 is further west than -73.7976 because -74 is smaller than -73.

Longitude increases as you go east, so -73.7976 is east of -74.0060. Let me calculate the difference.

Difference in longitude: -73.7976 - (-74.0060) = -73.7976 + 74.0060 = 0.2084 degrees east.

So, the given point is east of New York City.

Now, what area is east of NYC? NYC is in New York state, but there might be other states nearby.

Latitude 40.7498 is slightly north of NYC's 40.7128.

I think this might be in Long Island or somewhere in New York state.

I know that:

- New York City is in New York state.

- Latitude 40-41 and longitude -74 to -73 covers parts of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, etc.

But specifically, longitude -73.7976 is around -74, which is NYC area.

I recall that Central Park in NYC is around 40.785, -73.968. Let me think.

Actually, I think the coordinates given might be for a specific place. Let me try to recall or estimate.

Perhaps it's in Queens or Brooklyn.

I can think about the approximate location.

Latitude 40.7498: NYC is 40.7128, so about 0.037 degrees north. Since 1 degree latitude is about 111 km, 0.037 * 111 ≈ 4.1 km north of NYC center.

Longitude -73.7976 vs NYC's -74.0060: difference of 0.2084 degrees. 1 degree longitude at equator is about 111 km, but at latitude 40, it's cos(40) * 111 ≈ 0.766 * 111 ≈ 85 km per degree.

So, 0.2084 * 85 ≈ 17.714 km east.

So, approximately 17.7 km east and 4.1 km north of NYC center.

NYC center is around Manhattan. East and north might be towards Queens or Bronx.

Actually, north of Manhattan is Harlem, Bronx, but east is towards Brooklyn and Queens.

From Times Square (approx 40.757, -73.985), but earlier I used 40.7128, -74.0060, which might be a different point.

Standard NYC coordinates are often given as 40.7831, -73.9712 for Central Park or something. I need better reference.

I think latitude 40.7498 and longitude -73.7976 sounds familiar. I think this might be LaGuardia Airport or something.

LaGuardia Airport is in Queens, New York, with coordinates approximately 40.7772, -73.8726. That's close but not exact.

Given is 40.7498, -73.7976.

Perhaps it's Citi Field or something in Queens.

I can use the fact that most of this area is in New York state.

But to be precise, let's think about state boundaries.

New York state borders New Jersey to the south, Connecticut and Massachusetts to the east, etc.

Longitude -73.7976 is west of -73.5, which is around the Hudson River or east.

The Hudson River is around longitude -74 to -73.9 or so.

Manhattan is between -74.0 and -73.9 approximately.

Longitude -73.7976 is about -73.8, which is east of Manhattan, so likely in Queens or Long Island.

Long Island is part of New York state.

So, probably in New York state.

But is there any chance it's in another state? For example, if it's far east, it could be Connecticut, but latitude 40.75 is south of Connecticut's main part.

Connecticut's southern border is around latitude 41, I think. No, New York City is at 40.7, and Connecticut starts north of that.

Actually, the state line between New York and Connecticut is around longitude -73.7 or so in some parts.

Westchester County in New York is north of NYC, and Connecticut is further east.

For latitude 40.75, which is similar to NYC, the longitude -73.7976.

I think at that latitude, longitude around -73.8 is still within New York City, specifically Queens or Brooklyn.

Brooklyn is west, Queens is east.

Perhaps I can recall that the eastern part of Queens is still NY, and it doesn't cross into Connecticut until further north and east.

Connecticut's western border with New York is along the Byram River and then straight north, but at latitude 40.75, which is south, it's all New York or New Jersey.

New Jersey is south of NYC, across the Hudson.

Latitude 40.75 is north-south position. NYC is at about 40.7, so 40.75 is slightly north.

Long Island Sound is between Long Island and Connecticut.

Long Island is part of New York state, and its eastern end goes into Suffolk County, still NY.

But at longitude -73.7976, which is not very east.

Let's estimate the longitude.

New York City's easternmost point, like in Queens, longitude might be around -73.7 or so.

For example, JFK Airport is at approximately 40.6413, -73.7781. Latitude 40.6413 is south, longitude -73.7781 is close to -73.7976.

Given latitude is 40.7498, which is north of JFK's 40.6413.

JFK is at 40.64, given is 40.75, so about 0.11 degrees north, which is about 12 km north.

Longitude -73.7976 vs JFK's -73.7781, difference of -73.7976 + 73.7781 = -0.0195, so about 0.02 degrees west, since -73.7976 is more negative, wait no.

-73.7976 and -73.7781: -73.7976 is smaller (more west) than -73.7781.

Numerically, -73.7976 < -73.7781, so it's west of JFK.

Difference: -73.7781 - (-73.7976) = 0.0195 degrees east from the given point to JFK? No.

Longitude increases east, so -73.7976 to -73.7781 is an increase of 0.0195 degrees, so the given point is west of JFK.

But JFK is at longitude -73.7781, given is -73.7976, so given is more negative, thus further west.

West difference: |-73.7976| > |-73.7781| in magnitude but since negative, it's west.

Distance: 0.0195 degrees * 85 km/deg ≈ 1.66 km west of JFK's longitude.

But latitudes are different: given 40.7498 vs JFK 40.6413, difference 0.1085 degrees, about 12 km north.

So, north and slightly west of JFK.

JFK is in Queens, so north of JFK might still be Queens or perhaps near other areas.

Queens extends north to around latitude 40.8 or so.

LaGuardia Airport is at 40.777, -73.874, which is close.

Given: 40.7498, -73.7976

LaGuardia: approximately 40.777, -73.874

Difference latitude: 40.777 - 40.7498 = 0.0272 degrees south.

Longitude: -73.874 vs -73.7976, difference -73.7976 - (-73.874) = 0.0764 degrees east.

So, the given point is south and east of LaGuardia.

Still in the Queens area, I believe.

Perhaps it's near Flushing or something.

But importantly, all this is within New York state, specifically New York City, borough of Queens.

So, the state is New York.

To confirm, is there any possibility it's in another state? For example, if it were further east, say longitude -72, it might be Connecticut, but -73.8 is definitely within New York.

The border with Connecticut is around longitude -73.7 for the sound, but land border is further north.

At latitude 40.75, the area is solidly within Long Island, which is New York.

So, I think it's safe to say New York state.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should end with the state name.

Also, I should not ramble too much in the response, but since this is my reasoning, in the actual response, I can be concise.

The user said "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I need to provide some explanation or just directly answer?

Looking back: "What state does the place with latitude 40.7498 and longitude -73.7976 located in? Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

I should probably give a brief response and then the answer.

But as an AI, I can say something like: Based on the coordinates, this location is in the state of New York.

Then, final answer.

To be precise, I can confirm the exact location.

Upon second thought, I can search my knowledge or recall that these coordinates might be for a specific place.

Latitude 40.7498, longitude -73.7976.

I think this is very close to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens, which is where the US Open is held.

But regardless, it's in Queens, New York.

So, state is New York.

Final answer should be New York.

Now, to format the response.
