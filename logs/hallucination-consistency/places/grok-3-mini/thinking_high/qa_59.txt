*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 31.8476 and longitude -106.43 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 31.8476 is in the northern hemisphere since it's positive, and longitude -106.43 is west of the Prime Meridian because it's negative.

I recall that the United States has various states with different coordinates. I need to think about which state is around latitude 31.8476 N and longitude 106.43 W.

Considering the approximate latitudes and longitudes of US states:

- Texas is in the south, with latitudes around 26° to 36° N.

- New Mexico is also in the southwest, with latitudes similar to Texas.

Longitude -106.43 W sounds familiar. I think that's around the area of El Paso, Texas.

I remember that El Paso, Texas, is near the border with Mexico and New Mexico. Let me confirm the coordinates of El Paso.

From my knowledge, El Paso is approximately at latitude 31.7619 N and longitude -106.4850 W. That's very close to the given coordinates: 31.8476 N and -106.43 W.

Calculating the difference:

- Latitude difference: 31.8476 - 31.7619 ≈ 0.0857 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.0857 * 111 ≈ 9.5 km, so it's very close.

- Longitude difference: -106.43 - (-106.4850) = 0.055 degrees. 1 degree of longitude at this latitude is roughly 111 km * cos(31.8476°) ≈ 111 * 0.85 ≈ 94.35 km, so 0.055 * 94.35 ≈ 5.19 km. Again, very close.

So, the coordinates are likely in El Paso, Texas.

Now, is El Paso in Texas or New Mexico? El Paso is definitely in Texas. The city is in Texas, but it's right on the border with New Mexico.

Confirming the exact location: Latitude 31.8476 N and longitude -106.43 W.

I should check if this could be in New Mexico. New Mexico's western border is around longitude -109 W, and eastern around -103 W. Longitude -106.43 W is within New Mexico's range.

New Mexico's longitude range is approximately from -103° W to -109° W. -106.43 W is within that.

Latitude for New Mexico is from about 31.3° N to 37° N, so 31.8476 N is also within New Mexico.

But the coordinates given are very close to El Paso, which is in Texas.

El Paso, Texas, is at the western tip of Texas, and just across the state line is New Mexico.

I need to determine exactly which side of the border this point is on.

From the coordinates I recalled, El Paso is at -106.4850 W, and the given is -106.43 W, which is slightly east of that.

Longitude -106.43 W is less negative than -106.4850 W, so it's east of El Paso.

Longitude decreases as you go west, so -106.43 is greater than -106.4850 (since -106.43 > -106.4850), so it's east of El Paso.

Numerically, -106.43 is greater than -106.4850, but in terms of direction, since longitude west is negative, a higher number (less negative) means east.

Standard longitude: increasing east, decreasing west.

In decimal degrees, longitude west is negative, so -106.43 W is at 106.43 degrees west.

Compared to El Paso's approx -106.485 W, -106.43 is actually east because -106.43 > -106.485, meaning it's closer to 0, so less west, thus east.

Difference in longitude: -106.43 - (-106.485) = +0.055, so 0.055 degrees east of El Paso's longitude.

El Paso is in Texas, and to the east is still Texas until you hit other states, but Texas extends east.

The state border between Texas and New Mexico is along a meridian.

I think the border between Texas and New Mexico is at longitude 103° W or something? No.

Actually, the western border of Texas is along the 103rd meridian west for part of it, but with New Mexico, it's a straight line.

Upon thinking, the border between Texas and New Mexico is not a simple meridian. Texas's western border with New Mexico is along the 103rd meridian from 36.5° N north, but south of that, it's different.

Historically, the border is along the 103rd meridian, but I think for the southern part, it's straight.

El Paso is in Texas, and the Rio Grande forms part of the border with Mexico, but with New Mexico, it's to the north.

New Mexico is north and west of El Paso.

El Paso County, Texas, is bordered by New Mexico to the north and west.

The city of El Paso is in Texas, and just north is New Mexico.

But the coordinates given are latitude 31.8476 N, which is similar to El Paso's 31.76 N, so slightly north.

El Paso's latitude is about 31.76 N, given is 31.8476 N, so about 0.0876 degrees north.

1 degree latitude is 111 km, so 0.0876 * 111 ≈ 9.72 km north of El Paso's center.

El Paso is at the southern end, so moving north might cross into New Mexico.

The state line between Texas and New Mexico in that area is at approximately latitude 32° N or something? No.

Actually, the border between Texas and New Mexico is a straight line along the 32nd parallel or? No.

Upon recollection, the border between Texas and New Mexico is not along a parallel of latitude; it's a meridian.

Texas's western border with New Mexico is along the 103rd meridian west from the 36°30' parallel north to the Red River, but south of that, it's the 103rd meridian down to the international border with Mexico.

I think the 103rd meridian is further west.

El Paso's longitude is around -106.5 W, and 103 W is east of that? No.

Longitude: 103 W is less west than 106 W, so 103 W is east of 106 W.

Standard: lower longitude number is east.

103 W is at 103 degrees west, 106 W is at 106 degrees west, so 106 W is west of 103 W.

Numerically, 106 > 103, but since both west, 106 W is further west.

Degrees west: higher number means further west.

So, 103 W is closer to the east, 106 W is further west.

The border between Texas and New Mexico: I believe it's along the 103rd meridian west.

Yes, the western boundary of Texas is the 103rd meridian west from the parallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes north down to the 32nd parallel, and then it follows the Red River, but for the southern part, from the 32nd parallel south to the Rio Grande, it's along the 103rd meridian.

Upon second thought, I think the 103rd meridian is the border, but El Paso is at 106 W, which is west of 103 W.

103 W is longitude 103 degrees west, El Paso is at 106.5 W, so 106.5 W is west of 103 W, meaning El Paso is in Texas, but the border should be at 103 W.

That doesn't make sense because New Mexico extends to about 109 W on the west.

I think I have it wrong.

Let me correct: the eastern border of New Mexico is along the 103rd meridian west with Texas.

Yes: New Mexico's eastern border is the 103rd meridian west, which is the western border of Texas.

So, longitude 103 W is the border.

El Paso's longitude is approximately -106.5 W, which is west of -103 W.

-106.5 is more negative, so further west.

If the border is at 103 W, and El Paso is at 106.5 W, that means El Paso is west of the border, so it should be in New Mexico, but I know that's not right.

I must have the longitude wrong.

Standard knowledge: Texas's westernmost point is El Paso, at about 104.8 W or something? No.

Let's think: Denver, Colorado is at about 105 W, and New Mexico is west of that.

Actually, longitude for El Paso: I think it's around 106 W, and the border with New Mexico is to the north, not west.

Geography: El Paso, Texas, is located in the far west of Texas. To the west is Mexico, across the Rio Grande. To the north is New Mexico state.

The state line between Texas and New Mexico runs north-south, and it's not along a meridian of longitude in a simple way for that area.

Upon recollection, the border between Texas and New Mexico is along the 32nd parallel north from the 103rd meridian, but I think for the El Paso area, the border is irregular.

Actually, upon thinking, the straight-line border between Texas and New Mexico is along the 103rd meridian from 36.5 N down, but for the southern part, Texas extends west to include El Paso.

Historical fact: Texas's western border was defined by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and other agreements, and El Paso is part of Texas.

The longitude of the Texas-New Mexico border in the El Paso area is not 103 W; 103 W is further east.

Let's estimate: Albuquerque, New Mexico, is at about 106.6 W longitude, and El Paso is at 106.5 W, so they are close.

Albuquerque is north of El Paso.

El Paso latitude 31.8 N, Albuquerque 35.1 N, both around 106.5 W longitude.

The state line between Texas and New Mexico runs along the 32nd parallel or something? No.

Upon correct recollection, the border between Texas and New Mexico is a straight line along the meridian, but I think it's the 103rd meridian for the northern part, but for the southern part, Texas's western border with New Mexico is along the 32nd parallel from the 103rd meridian south to the Rio Grande, but that doesn't make sense.

I think I have it: the western boundary of Texas is the 103rd meridian west from the parallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes north south to the 32nd parallel, and then from the 32nd parallel west along that parallel to the Rio Grande, which forms the border with Mexico.

Yes, that's it.

So, the 32nd parallel north is latitude 32 N.

The given latitude is 31.8476 N, which is less than 32 N, so south of 32 N.

According to the border description, south of 32 N, the border between Texas and New Mexico is along the 32nd parallel only for the part west, but wait.

From the 103rd meridian south to 32 N along the meridian, then from 32 N west along the parallel to the Rio Grande.

But the Rio Grande is the border with Mexico, and El Paso is on the Rio Grande.

For latitudes south of 32 N, in the El Paso area, what is the state?

El Paso is at latitude about 31.76 N, which is south of 32 N, and it's in Texas.

According to the border, from 32 N west to the Rio Grande, that line is the border between Texas and New Mexico.

So, along latitude 32 N, from longitude 103 W west to the Rio Grande, that is the border.

South of 32 N is Texas, north of 32 N is New Mexico, in that longitudinal range.

The border is along the 32nd parallel from the 103rd meridian west to the Rio Grande. So, for longitudes west of 103 W, the line at 32 N is the border, with north being New Mexico and south being Texas.

Yes.

Now, the given coordinates: latitude 31.8476 N, which is less than 32 N, so south of 32 N.

Longitude -106.43 W, which is about 106.43 W.

Now, is 106.43 W west of 103 W? Yes, 106.43 > 103, so further west.

And the Rio Grande is at around that longitude in El Paso.

So, since latitude is 31.8476 N < 32 N, and longitude is around -106.43 W, which is within the range where the border is defined by the 32nd parallel.

Therefore, south of 32 N is Texas.

So, the point at 31.8476 N, -106.43 W should be in Texas.

Moreover, earlier calculation showed it's very close to El Paso, which is in Texas.

To confirm, I can think of known places. For example, the University of Texas at El Paso or other landmarks.

I could also consider that the coordinates are likely within El Paso city limits or nearby, all in Texas.

Just to be thorough, let's check if it could be in Mexico. The US-Mexico border is the Rio Grande, and El Paso is on the north side.

The Rio Grande at El Paso is approximately at latitude 31.75 N or so, but the river meanders.

Generally, north of the river is US, south is Mexico.

Given latitude 31.8476 N is north, and longitude -106.43 W, it should be in the US.

Now, within the US, as per state border, south of 32 N and west of 103 W but east of the river's path, it's Texas.

Longitude -106.43 W: the Rio Grande in that area might have specific paths, but typically, El Paso area is around there.

I think it's safe to say it's in Texas.

Finally, the state is Texas.

So, my answer should be Texas.
