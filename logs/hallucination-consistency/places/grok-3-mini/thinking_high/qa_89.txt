*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.5834 and longitude -74.1496 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

I know that latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 40.5834 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -74.1496 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that New York City is around latitude 40.7128 and longitude -74.0060. This given coordinate is close: latitude 40.5834 is a bit south of NYC, and longitude -74.1496 is slightly west.

Longitude -74.1496 is more negative, so it's further west than NYC's -74.0060. NYC is around -74, so -74.1496 is indeed west of that.

Now, thinking about states: New York state includes NYC, but there are other states nearby. To the west of NYC is New Jersey. I think New Jersey has coordinates around there.

I remember that the Statue of Liberty is in New York, but it's on an island in New York Harbor, which is actually in New Jersey water or something? No, the state boundary might be relevant.

Perhaps I can think about major cities. Latitude 40.5834 and longitude -74.1496 – let's see if this rings a bell.

I think this might be close to Newark, New Jersey. Newark Airport is in New Jersey, and I believe its coordinates are around 40.6925 N, -74.1685 W or something like that. Wait, let me recall.

Actually, upon second thought, latitude 40.5834 seems a bit low. NYC is 40.7128, so 40.5834 is about 0.13 degrees south. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.13 degrees is roughly 14.4 km south of NYC.

Longitude difference: -74.1496 vs -74.0060 for NYC, difference of about 0.1436 degrees. 1 degree longitude at equator is about 111 km, but at 40 degrees latitude, it's less: cos(40) ≈ 0.766, so about 85 km per degree. So 0.1436 degrees is roughly 12.2 km west.

So, approximately 14.4 km south and 12.2 km west of NYC center. NYC is in New York state, but moving south and west might cross into New Jersey.

The Hudson River separates New York and New Jersey. The state line is roughly along the river.

I think the coordinate given might be in New Jersey. Let me think about specific places.

Perhaps I can recall that the latitude and longitude point to a location in New Jersey. For example, is this near Elizabeth or Newark?

I can use my knowledge that the area around latitude 40.5 to 40.6 and longitude -74.1 to -74.2 is in northern New Jersey.

Confirming with known points: Trenton, NJ is around 40.217, -74.76, which is further south and west. No, Trenton is south of NYC.

NYC is 40.7, Trenton is about 40.2, so yes, 40.5834 is between them.

Perhaps this is near Perth Amboy or something. But I think it's likely in New Jersey.

I can think about the fact that longitude -74.1496 is west of the Hudson River. The Hudson River is around longitude -74.0 or so for parts of it.

Actually, the Hudson River mouth is around -74.0, and west of that is New Jersey.

Given longitude -74.1496, which is more negative, so further west, definitely in New Jersey.

Latitude 40.5834: NYC harbor area. I think this might be in the area of Staten Island or something, but Staten Island is part of New York City, so New York state.

Staten Island is in New York state, but it's surrounded by water, and the coordinate might be on the mainland.

Let's calculate roughly: latitude 40.5834, NYC is 40.7128, so south. Staten Island's southern part might be around there.

I think Staten Island's latitude ranges from about 40.5 to 40.6 or so. Let me recall: the Verrazano Bridge is around there.

Perhaps I should consider that the coordinate is likely in New Jersey because of the longitude.

I can think about the state boundaries. The boundary between New York and New Jersey is the Hudson River, and for this longitude, it should be clear.

Upon second thought, longitude -74.1496: let's convert to decimal. It's -74.1496, which is about 74 degrees 8.976 minutes west.

But perhaps I can use a mental map. I know that Central Park in NYC is at 40.785, -73.968, which is east.

-73.968 is less negative, so east of -74.1496.

Longitude increases eastward as the number decreases in negativity? No: longitude -73.968 is west of -74.1496? No.

Numerically, -73.968 is greater than -74.1496, so -73.968 is east of -74.1496 because -73.968 is closer to zero.

Longitude: more negative means further west. So -74.1496 is west of -74.0060 (NYC), and -74.0060 is west of -73.968 (Central Park).

Central Park is at approximately -73.965, which is east.

So, -74.1496 is further west.

The Hudson River: its longitude varies, but around Manhattan, it's from about -73.95 to -74.02 or something. Actually, the western shore of Manhattan is around -74.0.

For example, Jersey City, NJ is across from lower Manhattan, and its longitude is around -74.077, latitude around 40.717.

Given latitude 40.5834 is south of that. So, south of Jersey City.

Moving south, the state line is still the river, but as you go south, you hit the Arthur Kill or something, which separates New Jersey from Staten Island (NY).

Staten Island is part of New York, so if the coordinate is west of the Arthur Kill, it might be in New Jersey.

Latitude 40.5834: let's see where that is. I think the southern part of Manhattan is around 40.70, and Staten Island extends south to about 40.50 or so.

Staten Island's southern tip is around 40.49, and northern part around 40.63 or something. I'm not sure.

Perhaps this coordinate is in New Jersey, near Elizabeth or Linden.

I recall that Newark Liberty International Airport is at approximately 40.6925 N, 74.1687 W. So latitude 40.6925, longitude -74.1687.

The given coordinate is 40.5834 N, -74.1496 W. So latitude is lower: 40.5834 vs 40.6925, difference of about 0.1091 degrees, which is about 12.1 km south (since 1 deg lat = 111 km).

Longitude -74.1496 vs -74.1687, difference of 0.0191 degrees. At latitude 40, 1 deg long = 85 km, so 0.0191 deg ≈ 1.62 km east (since -74.1496 is less negative than -74.1687, so east).

-74.1496 is greater than -74.1687, so it's east of Newark Airport.

Newark Airport is at 40.6925, -74.1687, given is 40.5834, -74.1496.

So, about 12.1 km south and 1.62 km east of Newark Airport.

Newark Airport is in New Jersey, specifically in Newark, Essex County, NJ.

Moving south from Newark, still in New Jersey. The area south of Newark might be Elizabeth or other towns in Union County, NJ.

Latitude 40.5834 is still north of, say, Rahway or other places.

I think the entire area around there is in New Jersey.

But is there any chance it's in New York? Staten Island is to the east, across the Arthur Kill.

The Arthur Kill is between Staten Island (NY) and New Jersey. The longitude of Arthur Kill: I think it's around -74.2 or something.

Staten Island's western shore is along the Arthur Kill, and its longitude might be around -74.25 or so for the western part.

For example, the Verrazano Bridge is at the north of Staten Island, longitude around -74.05 or something. I'm confusing myself.

Perhaps I can estimate: if Newark is at -74.17, and Staten Island is east of that, no, Staten Island is south and a bit west or east.

Actually, Staten Island is southwest of Manhattan. From Manhattan, go south and west to Staten Island.

But longitude: Manhattan is around -74.0, Staten Island might have longitudes from -74.05 to -74.25 or so.

Upon thinking, the eastern part of Staten Island is closer to -74.1, and western part more negative.

But the given longitude is -74.1496, which is about -74.15.

I think the Arthur Kill is around longitude -74.2 to -74.25. I'm not sure.

Perhaps the coordinate 40.5834, -74.1496 is likely in New Jersey.

To be precise, I can think that since it's close to Newark and south of it, and Newark is in NJ, and there's no state line crossing there abruptly, it should be in New Jersey.

Moreover, latitude 40.5834 is approximately the latitude of, say, Woodbridge or Carteret in NJ.

I can confirm with a known point. For example, I know that the location might be near Rahway, NJ, which is around 40.605, -74.277 or something. Wait, no.

Upon second thought, I think the coordinate is very likely in New Jersey.

But to make sure, let's consider the distance. From NYC center, it's south and west, crossing the Hudson into NJ.

The state of New York includes parts up to the river, but west of the river is NJ.

Given longitude -74.1496, which is west of the Hudson River's typical longitudes.

The Hudson River at the latitude of, say, 40.6, what is its longitude? Near the southern end, around 40.7, it's about -74.0, and as you go south, it might vary, but generally, west of -74.0 is NJ.

Actually, at latitude 40.5834, which is south of Manhattan, perhaps near the area where the river opens to the bay.

But I think safely, with longitude -74.1496, it's in New Jersey.

Moreover, I can think that the coordinate might be for a specific place, but since the user didn't specify, I just need the state.

So, I believe it's in New Jersey.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should conclude with the state name.

Just to double-check, is there any possibility it's in another state? Pennsylvania is further west and south, Delaware, etc., no, this is clearly in the NYC metro area.

Connecticut or other states are not nearby.

So, yes.
