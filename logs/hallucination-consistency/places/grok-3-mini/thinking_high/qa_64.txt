*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 36.1283 and longitude -95.9042 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 36.1283 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -95.9042 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I need to recall which states are around these coordinates. Latitude 36 is roughly around the middle of the US, and longitude -95 is in the central part.

Let me think about US states:

- Oklahoma is around latitude 35-37 and longitude -94 to -100.

- Specifically, Tulsa, Oklahoma is a city I know. I think Tulsa has coordinates around 36.15 latitude and -96 longitude. Let me verify that.

Upon thinking, I recall that Tulsa, Oklahoma is approximately at 36.1539 latitude and -95.9928 longitude. The given coordinates are 36.1283 latitude and -95.9042 longitude. That's very close to Tulsa's coordinates.

Let me calculate the difference:

- Latitude difference: 36.1539 - 36.1283 = 0.0256 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.0256 degrees is roughly 2.84 km.

- Longitude difference: -95.9928 - (-95.9042) = -95.9928 + 95.9042 = -0.0886 degrees. Longitude degrees vary, but at latitude 36, 1 degree is about 111 km * cos(36°) ≈ 111 * 0.809 ≈ 89.8 km, so 0.0886 degrees is about 7.96 km.

So the distance is small, meaning it's very close to Tulsa.

Now, Tulsa is in Oklahoma. So probably, this point is also in Oklahoma.

But I should confirm if it's exactly in Oklahoma or perhaps near a border.

Oklahoma's borders: North is Kansas, South is Texas, East is Arkansas and Missouri, West is Texas and New Mexico.

Latitude 36.1283 is just below 36.5, which is the northern border of Oklahoma with Kansas. The 36th parallel is the northern border of Oklahoma.

The 36th parallel north is the boundary between Oklahoma and Kansas. Latitude 36.0000 is exactly the border.

The given latitude is 36.1283, which is north of 36.0000, so it's south of the border, meaning it's in Oklahoma.

Longitude -95.9042: Oklahoma's eastern border is around -94.43 to -95.something. Arkansas is east, and the border might be around -94.5 or so.

Tulsa is in northeastern Oklahoma, so longitude -95.9 is within Oklahoma.

To be precise, I can think about nearby cities or use general knowledge.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I should rely on what I know.

I know that:

- Latitude 36.1283 N, Longitude -95.9042 W.

Common US cities:

- Denver is around 39.7, -105, too far.

- Dallas is 32.7, -96.8.

- Kansas City is around 39.1, -94.6.

- St. Louis is 38.6, -90.2.

- Memphis is 35.1, -90.0.

- Little Rock is 34.7, -92.3.

- Oklahoma City is 35.5, -97.5.

Oklahoma City is at 35.5 N, -97.5 W.

Given is 36.1283 N, -95.9042 W.

So closer to the northeast.

Tulsa is indeed around there.

I can estimate the state.

Longitude -95 is between -90 (Mississippi River) and -100 (roughly Texas panhandle).

States in that longitude range: Oklahoma, parts of Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas.

But latitude 36.1283 is specific.

Kansas starts at latitude 37 north for its southern border, I think. No, Kansas southern border is with Oklahoma at 37 degrees north? No.

Standard US borders:

- The 36°30′ parallel north forms part of the boundary between Missouri and Arkansas, and also between Tennessee and Kentucky, but for Oklahoma, the northern border is 37 degrees north with Colorado, but no.

Oklahoma's northern border is the 37th parallel with Colorado? No.

Actually, Oklahoma's panhandle has different borders, but the main part: northern border with Kansas is along the 37th parallel? No.

I think I'm confusing it.

Upon recollection: The Kansas-Oklahoma border is not a simple latitude. Actually, the southern border of Kansas is irregular, but generally around 37 degrees.

No: Kansas extends south to about 37 degrees north.

Latitude lines:

- 36th parallel is the historical Mason-Dixon like for the US, but specifically, the 36°30′ parallel was part of the Missouri Compromise, but for Oklahoma, the northern border with Kansas is approximately 37 degrees north.

I think Kansas's southern border is with Oklahoma, and it's not exactly on a latitude line, but close to 37 degrees.

Actually, upon thinking, the 100th meridian and such, but for latitude.

I know that Tulsa is in Oklahoma, and coordinates match.

To confirm, I can think that latitude 36.1283 is between 36 and 37, and longitude -95.9 is east of -100.

States at lat 36: California has higher latitudes, no.

Lat 36: Southern California is around 34, Nevada 36-42, but longitude -115 to -120.

Longitude -95 is central US.

List of states by approximate coordinates:

- Oklahoma: lat 33.5 to 37, long -94.5 to -103.

Yes, longitude -95.9042 is within -94.5 to -103.

Latitude 36.1283 is within 33.5 to 37.

Moreover, it's not near any border that would put it in another state.

For example, the eastern border of Oklahoma with Arkansas is along the meridian, but I think it's around -94.5, while -95.9 is west of that, so deep in Oklahoma.

Longitude increases westward? No, longitude west is negative, so -95.9 is more west than -94.5.

Standard: lower longitude numbers are east, higher negative are west.

Longitude -94.5 is east of -95.9, since -94.5 > -95.9 numerically, but in direction, -94.5 is east of -95.9.

Clarify: Longitude lines: -90 is east of -100.

So -94.5 is approximately the eastern border of Oklahoma.

Oklahoma's easternmost point is around -94.43, I think.

-95.9042 is west of that, since -95.9042 < -94.43 (more negative), so further west.

Yes, so definitely within Oklahoma.

Nearest cities: As I thought, Tulsa is very close.

In fact, looking up in my mind, 36.1283, -95.9042 might be a specific point in Tulsa or nearby.

But regardless, it's in Oklahoma.

So the state is Oklahoma.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So I should respond with some reasoning, but since the instruction is to reason step by step, I'll do that, and then box the answer.

In this format, I need to provide the response.

Final answer should be the state name.

So, I'll conclude.
