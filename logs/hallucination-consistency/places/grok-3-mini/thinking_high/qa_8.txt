*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 33.7628 and longitude -84.422 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 33.7628 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -84.422 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that major US cities have known coordinates. For example, Atlanta, Georgia, is around there. Let me confirm: Atlanta's coordinates are approximately 33.7490 N, -84.3880 W. The given coordinates are 33.7628 N, -84.422 W, which is very close to Atlanta.

33.7628 vs. 33.7490 – that's a difference of about 0.0138 degrees in latitude. Since 1 degree of latitude is roughly 111 km, 0.0138 degrees is about 1.53 km. For longitude, -84.422 vs. -84.388 – difference of 0.034 degrees. Longitude degrees vary, but at this latitude, 1 degree is about 111 km * cos(33.7628°) ≈ 111 * 0.832 ≈ 92.35 km, so 0.034 degrees is about 3.14 km.

So, the given coordinates are roughly 1.5 km north and 3.1 km west of standard Atlanta coordinates. That still places it within the Atlanta metropolitan area.

Atlanta is in the state of Georgia. So, the state should be Georgia.

To be thorough, I should ensure there are no other states nearby that this could be mistaken for. Latitude 33.7628 is south of states like Tennessee or North Carolina, and north of Florida. Longitude -84.422 is east of the Mississippi River, so it's in the eastern US.

Nearby states: Georgia borders Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida. But the coordinates are squarely in Georgia.

I can think about other cities: For example, Charlotte, North Carolina, is around 35.227 N, -80.837 W, which is farther north and west. Or Birmingham, Alabama, is about 33.5207 N, -86.8025 W, which is similar latitude but much farther west in longitude.

So, definitely Atlanta area.

The user asked for the state, not the city. Since Atlanta is in Georgia, the state is Georgia.

Finally, the response should end with the answer on a new line. So, I'll write my reasoning, then put the answer.

The instruction is: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So, I need to have the answer on a new line.

Also, keep it clear and not verbose, but since I'm an AI, I can provide a brief explanation.

Response structure:

- Acknowledge the query.

- Briefly explain how I determined it.

- State the answer on a new line.
