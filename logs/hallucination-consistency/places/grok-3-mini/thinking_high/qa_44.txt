*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.7776 and longitude -111.9311 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate falls into.

I know that latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 40.7776 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -111.9311 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western part of the world.

Since the coordinates are in the range that typically covers the United States, I should focus on US states. Longitude -111 is around the Rocky Mountains area. I recall that Utah has longitudes around there. Let me think about the boundaries.

I know that:

- Colorado has longitudes from about -102 to -109.

- Utah is between approximately -109 and -114 longitude, and latitudes from 37 to 42 north.

Latitude 40.7776: That's roughly 40.8 degrees north. Utah's northern border is around 42 degrees, and southern is 37, so 40.8 is within Utah.

Longitude -111.9311: Utah's eastern border is around -109, and western is about -114. -111.9311 is west of -109, so it should be in Utah.

But let me double-check with nearby states. For example, Wyoming is north of Utah, with latitudes up to 45, but its longitude might overlap. Wyoming's longitudes are from -104 to -111, so -111.9311 is very close to the western edge of Wyoming, but Wyoming's western longitude is about -111, so -111.9311 might be just west of that.

Longitude decreases as you go west. So, -111 is west of -109. Standard longitude for states:

- Utah: Longitude from approximately -109.05 (east) to -114.05 (west).

- Specifically, the coordinate -111.9311: Let's see, Salt Lake City is around there. I think Salt Lake City, Utah, has coordinates close to 40.7608 N, -111.8910 W. That's very close to 40.7776 N, -111.9311 W.

40.7776 and -111.9311 â€“ comparing to Salt Lake City: 40.7608 and -111.8910. It's very similar, just a bit north and west, but still in the same area.

Salt Lake City is definitely in Utah. So, this coordinate is likely in Utah.

To be precise, I should confirm if it's exactly in Utah or perhaps in a neighboring state.

Neighboring states:

- North: Idaho and Wyoming. Idaho is west, with longitudes around -111 to -117, latitudes 42 to 49. Latitude 40.7776 is south of 42, so not Idaho.

Wyoming: Latitudes 41 to 45 north, longitudes -104.05 to -111.05. Longitude -111.9311 is west of -111.05? -111.9311 is more negative, so it's west of -111.05.

Wyoming's western border is at approximately -111 degrees longitude. I think it's along the 111th meridian.

Upon recollection, the border between Utah and Wyoming is along the 41st parallel north for part, but actually, Wyoming's western border is with Idaho, and Utah is south.

Standard knowledge: The coordinate given is very close to Salt Lake City, which is in Utah.

I can think about the longitude: -111.9311 is about 111.9311 degrees west.

Utah's eastern border is at 109 degrees west with Colorado, and it extends west to the Nevada border.

Specifically, the point -111.9311 W is within Utah.

To confirm, let's think about cities: Latitude 40.7776 N could be around Ogden or something in Utah.

Ogden, Utah is around 41.22 N, -111.97 W, close but a bit north.

Salt Lake City is 40.76 N, -111.89 W, as I said.

The given lat 40.7776 is slightly north of SLC's 40.76, and lon -111.9311 is slightly west of -111.89.

Still within the Salt Lake Valley, which is in Utah.

No other state has this combination. For example, Colorado is east, with longitudes less negative, like -105 to -102 for Denver area.

Nevada is west, but its longitudes are more negative, like -114 to -120, and latitudes similar, but the longitude -111.9311 is not that far west.

Nevada starts around -114.5 or so for the eastern border.

Utah's western border is with Nevada at approximately -114 degrees longitude.

So, -111.9311 is well within Utah, not near the border.

Therefore, the state is Utah.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should conclude with the answer on a new line.
