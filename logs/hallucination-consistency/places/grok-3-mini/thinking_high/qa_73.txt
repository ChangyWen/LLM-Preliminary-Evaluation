*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 42.1155 and longitude -72.5395 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate falls into.

Latitude and longitude are given: 42.1155 N and -72.5395 W. The negative longitude indicates it's west of the Prime Meridian, which is typical for the Americas.

I know that latitude 42 is roughly in the northern part of the US, and longitude -72 is in the eastern part. Let me recall some state boundaries.

- New York has latitudes around 40-45 N and longitudes from -71 to -79 W.

- Massachusetts is around latitude 42 N and longitude -70 to -73 W.

- Connecticut is south of Massachusetts, around latitude 41-42 N and longitude -72 to -73.5 W.

Longitude -72.5395 is west, so it's in the eastern US.

Latitude 42.1155 is about 42.1 N.

I think this might be in Massachusetts or Connecticut. Let me think about the border.

I recall that the border between Massachusetts and Connecticut is around latitude 42 N. Specifically, the southern border of Massachusetts is at 42° N in some parts.

Upon thinking, the Massachusetts-Connecticut border is not exactly at 42° N; it's a bit irregular. But latitude 42.1155 is slightly north of 42°, so it might be in Massachusetts.

Longitude -72.5395. Let's see:

- Hartford, Connecticut is around 41.76 N, -72.68 W.

- Springfield, Massachusetts is around 42.10 N, -72.59 W.

Springfield, MA is very close to 42.1155 N and -72.5395 W.

Let me verify approximate coordinates:

- Springfield, MA: I think it's about 42.1015 N, 72.5855 W. Wait, close but let's check.

Actually, from memory, 42.1155 and -72.5395 sounds familiar for Springfield area.

I can think about the state boundaries.

Massachusetts extends to about longitude -73 W on the west and -69.9 W on the east, with latitude from 41.18 N to 42.88 N or something like that.

More accurately:

- Southernmost point of Massachusetts is around 41.18 N in the west.

- But the border with Connecticut: in the Connecticut River valley, it's approximately at 42° N.

Specifically, the town of Springfield is in Massachusetts, and it's north of the border.

Latitude 42.1155 is greater than 42, so it's north, likely in Massachusetts.

Longitude -72.5395 is around there.

I can consider that this coordinate is very close to Springfield, Massachusetts, which is in Hampden County, Massachusetts.

To be thorough, I should confirm if it's possibly in another state.

Adjacent states:

- North: Vermont and New Hampshire, but their longitudes are more west and east respectively.

Vermont is around -72 to -73 W, latitude higher.

But latitude 42.1155 is not high enough for Vermont; Vermont starts around 42.7 N or so in some parts, but the southern border is at 42.75 N or something? No.

Vermont's southern border is with Massachusetts and it's irregular, but generally, latitude 42.1155 is south of most of Vermont.

Vermont's lowest latitude is around 42.7 N in the southwest, I think. No, actually, the Massachusetts-Vermont border is around 42.5 to 43 N.

I'm getting confused.

Standard knowledge: Latitude 42 N runs through New York, Massachusetts, etc.

Specifically, for longitude -72.5 W:

- At longitude -72.5 W, latitude 42 N is the border between Massachusetts and Connecticut in the Connecticut River area.

The straight line border is at 42° N from the New York border to the Connecticut River, and then it follows the river.

Springfield is north of that, in Massachusetts.

Coordinate 42.1155 N is 42 degrees and about 7 minutes north (since 0.1155 * 60 ≈ 6.93 minutes), so slightly north of 42° exactly.

The border is exactly at 42° N for part of it, so 42.1155 should be in Massachusetts.

Longitude -72.5395 W is west, so in the western part.

I think it's safe to say it's in Massachusetts.

But to be precise, I can recall that Springfield, MA has coordinates approximately 42.101, -72.583, which is very close to 42.1155, -72.5395. Slight difference, but probably the same area.

Perhaps it's a nearby town.

But in any case, it's within Massachusetts.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should be concise, and end with the state name.

I should make sure it's correct.

I can think about using a map or knowledge: latitude 42.1155, longitude -72.5395.

Converting to degrees: it's in the northeast US.

States in that area: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, etc.

Rhode Island is east, around -71.5 W.

Longitude -72.5 is west of Rhode Island.

New York is west, but latitude might be different.

Albany, NY is around 42.65 N, -73.75 W, which is further west and north.

So, no.

Thus, definitely Massachusetts.

I think the answer is Massachusetts.
