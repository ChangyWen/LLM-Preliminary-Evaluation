*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 30.3005 and longitude -97.7522 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 30.3005 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -97.7522 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different coordinates. Longitude -97 is around the central part of the US. For example, Texas is known to have longitudes around there.

Let me think about Texas. Austin, Texas, is a city I know. I think Austin's coordinates are approximately 30.2672 latitude and -97.7431 longitude. That sounds very close to 30.3005 and -97.7522.

Comparing:

- Given latitude: 30.3005

- Austin latitude: about 30.2672 (I might be slightly off, but it's close)

Actually, I should confirm the exact coordinates. From memory, Austin, Texas, is at approximately 30.2672° N, 97.7431° W. The given coordinates are 30.3005° N, 97.7522° W.

Let me calculate the difference:

- Latitude difference: 30.3005 - 30.2672 = 0.0333 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.0333 degrees is roughly 3.7 km.

- Longitude difference: -97.7522 - (-97.7431) = -0.0091 degrees. 1 degree of longitude at this latitude is about 111 km * cos(30°) ≈ 111 * 0.866 ≈ 96 km, so 0.0091 degrees is roughly 0.87 km.

So the given point is very close to Austin, Texas—about 3.7 km north and 0.87 km west, which is still within the Austin area or very nearby.

Austin is in Texas, so the state should be Texas.

But to be thorough, I should confirm if this exact point is still in Texas. Texas borders Oklahoma to the north, Arkansas and Louisiana to the east, but at latitude 30.3, it's well within Texas. The northern border of Texas is around 36.5 degrees north, so 30.3 is southern Texas.

Longitude -97.75 is central Texas. The western border is around -106, eastern around -94, so -97.75 is definitely within Texas.

I can think about nearby cities or landmarks. Latitude 30.3 and longitude -97.75 is squarely in the Austin metropolitan area.

Therefore, the state is Texas.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can briefly explain how I arrived at the answer, but since the user didn't ask for reasoning, I can keep it concise.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
