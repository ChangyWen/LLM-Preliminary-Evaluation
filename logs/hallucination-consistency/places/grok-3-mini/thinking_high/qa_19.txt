*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 39.762 and longitude -104.8758 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 39.762 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -104.8758 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different latitude and longitude ranges. Latitude 39.762 sounds familiar; I think Denver, Colorado is around there. Let me confirm that.

I know that Denver, Colorado has coordinates approximately 39.739° N, 104.990° W. The given latitude is 39.762, which is very close to 39.739, and longitude -104.8758 is close to -104.990. The negative sign indicates west, so -104.8758 W.

Calculating the difference: Latitude difference is 39.762 - 39.739 = 0.023 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.023 degrees is roughly 2.55 km. Longitude difference: -104.8758 - (-104.990) = 0.1142 degrees. At latitude 39.762, 1 degree of longitude is about 111 km * cos(39.762°) ≈ 111 * 0.77 ≈ 85.47 km, so 0.1142 degrees is about 9.76 km. So, the point is very close to Denver, probably within the city or nearby.

Denver is in Colorado, so the state should be Colorado.

To be thorough, I should consider if this could be in a neighboring state. Colorado is bordered by Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona. The latitude 39.762 is around the central part of Colorado, and longitude -104.8758 is also central-eastern Colorado.

Let me recall the boundaries:

- Colorado's northern border is around 41°N, southern around 37°N, eastern around -102°W, western around -109°W.

More precisely:

- Northern latitude: about 41°N

- Southern: 37°N

- Eastern longitude: about -102°W

- Western: -109°W

Given latitude 39.762 is between 37 and 41, and longitude -104.8758 is between -102 and -109, so definitely within Colorado.

Now, to confirm it's not in a different state, let's check adjacent states:

- To the east is Kansas, which starts around -102°W, but -104.8758 is west of that, so still in Colorado.

Longitude increases westward with negative values, so -104.8758 is more west than -102 (since -104.8758 < -102, meaning further west).

In terms of numerical value, -104.8758 is less than -102, but since it's negative, it's actually west of -102°W. Longitude: more negative means further west.

-102°W is east of -104°W because -102 is greater than -104 in numerical value, but in geography, -102°W is east of -104°W.

Standard longitude: increasing eastward from -180 to 180, but with negative for west.

So, -102°W is at 102 degrees west, and -104°W is at 104 degrees west, so -104°W is further west than -102°W.

Colorado's eastern border is approximately -102°W, so longitude -104.8758 is west of that, meaning inside Colorado.

Similarly, latitude 39.762 is within Colorado's range.

Moreover, the point is very close to Denver, which is unambiguously in Colorado.

I could think about using a map or database, but since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll stick with this.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should conclude with the state name on a new line.

Answer: Colorado
