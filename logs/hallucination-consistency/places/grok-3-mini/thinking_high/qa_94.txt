*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 33.7977 and longitude -118.167 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 33.7977 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -118.167 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different coordinates. Longitude -118 is around the west coast. Specifically, California has longitudes around there. Los Angeles is in California, and I think its coordinates are close to this.

I remember that Los Angeles is approximately at latitude 34.0522 N and longitude -118.2437 W. The given latitude is 33.7977 and longitude -118.167. That's a bit south and east of downtown LA, but still in the LA area.

33.7977 latitude is slightly south of LA, and -118.167 longitude is close. Perhaps it's in Southern California.

To be precise, I should think about which state this falls into. Longitude -118 is definitely in California. The western border of California is around -124 longitude, and it goes east to about -114. So -118 is well within California.

Now, latitude 33.7977: California's southern border is with Mexico, and the latitude there is around 32-33 degrees north. San Diego is at about 32.715 N, and Los Angeles is at 34.0522 N. So 33.7977 is between San Diego and LA, probably in Orange County or somewhere in Southern California.

I think latitude 33.7977 and longitude -118.167 might be close to Long Beach or something in California.

But to confirm, is there any chance it's in another state? Nevada is east of California, with longitudes around -114 to -120, but Nevada's western border is with California, so longitude -118 should still be in California. Longitude increases eastward, so -118 is west of -114. California's eastern border is around -114, and western is -124. So -118 is within California.

Latitude-wise, 33.7977 is north of Mexico, so it's in the US.

Arizona has longitudes from about -109 to -114, which is east of -118, so no. Utah and other states are further east.

So, definitely in California.

But to be thorough, let's think about the exact location. I can recall that the coordinates 33.7977, -118.167 might be in Long Beach, California. I think Long Beach is around there.

Yes, upon thinking, Long Beach, CA has coordinates approximately 33.7701 N, 118.1937 W, which is very close to 33.7977 N, -118.167 W. Slight difference, but probably the same area.

So, the state is California.

The user asked for the state, not the city, so I don't need to specify the city.

Finally, the response should end with the answer on a new line.

So, my final answer is California.
