*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 26.2252 and longitude -98.2467 is located. I need to determine which state in the US this corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are coordinates. Latitude 26.2252 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -98.2467 is west of the Prime Meridian. Negative longitude means it's in the western hemisphere.

I know that the US has states in various latitudes and longitudes. Latitude 26 is quite south. For reference, Miami, Florida, is around 25.76 latitude, so this is a bit north of that. Longitude -98 is around the central US. Texas has longitudes from about -93 to -107, so -98 is within Texas.

I recall that the southern tip of Texas is around 26 degrees north. Brownsville, Texas, is close to that latitude. Let me confirm the coordinates.

I think Brownsville, Texas, has coordinates approximately 25.9017 latitude and -97.4975 longitude. The given latitude is 26.2252, which is a bit higher, and longitude -98.2467, which is more west.

Perhaps it's still in Texas. Let me think about the states bordering Texas. To the east is Louisiana, but that's more east with longitudes around -92 to -94. To the west is New Mexico, with longitudes around -104 to -109. South is the Gulf of Mexico, but since latitude is 26, it's likely on land.

Latitude 26 is south, so in the US, that would be Florida or Texas. Florida's longitudes are from about -80 to -87, which is east of -98. -98 is much further west, so it can't be Florida.

Confirming: Florida's westernmost point is around Pensacola, which is about -87 longitude, while -98 is way west. So definitely not Florida.

Now, Texas: Texas spans from about 26N to 36N latitude and -94W to -107W longitude. Longitude -98 is within that range. Specifically, -98 longitude cuts through Texas.

I think cities like Corpus Christi or San Antonio might be around there. San Antonio is about 29.4N and -98.5W, which is close. Latitude 29.4 vs 26.2, so 26.2 is further south.

The southern part of Texas: Brownsville is 25.9N, -97.5W. So latitude 26.2252 is just north of Brownsville, and longitude -98.2467 is a bit west of -97.5.

Perhaps it's in the Rio Grande Valley area. Maybe near McAllen or something.

I can think about the state boundaries. The latitude 26.2252 and longitude -98.2467.

I know that the US-Mexico border is around there. The Rio Grande river forms the border.

Upon a quick mental map, longitude -98 is in Texas, probably in the southern part.

To be precise, I should confirm if it's in Texas or possibly another state, but I think Texas is the only state with latitudes that low in the west.

California has latitudes down to about 32N, which is higher than 26N, so no. Arizona and New Mexico are even higher latitudes.

Latitudes increase northward, so lower latitude means further south. 26N is south, 32N is north of that.

California's southernmost point is around 32.5N, which is higher latitude, so further north than 26N. So definitely not California or other western states.

Only Texas and Florida have latitudes below 30N in the contiguous US. Florida is out because of longitude.

So, it must be Texas.

But to be thorough, let's estimate the location.

Latitude 26.2252 N, longitude 98.2467 W.

I recall that the city of McAllen, Texas, is around 26.2N and -98.2W. Let me think: yes, McAllen is approximately 26.203, -98.23, which is very close to 26.2252 and -98.2467.

So, it's likely in or near McAllen, Texas.

Therefore, the state is Texas.

The user asked for the state, and to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should be helpful, perhaps explain a bit, but end with the answer.

Also, ensure that it's accurate. I should confirm if there's any chance it's in another state, but I don't think so.

Mexico is south, but the coordinates are likely in the US, as the latitude is above the border in some parts, but the Rio Grande border: at longitude -98.2467, I think it's still in Texas.

The US-Mexico border along the Rio Grande: at around latitude 26.2, longitude -98.2, it should be in Texas.

Yes, McAllen is in Texas.

So, I'm confident.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
The coordinates you provided—latitude 26.2252 and longitude -98.2467—correspond to a location in the southern part of Texas, United States. This area is near the city of McAllen, which is situated in the Rio Grande Valley region. Texas is the only U.S. state with latitudes this low and longitudes in this range, as other southern states like Florida have significantly different longitudes.

Final answer:  
Texas
