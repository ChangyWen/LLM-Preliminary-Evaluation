First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 39.7771 and longitude -86.1458 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 39.7771 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -86.1458 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different latitude and longitude ranges. I need to figure out which state this falls into.

Let me think about the longitude: -86.1458. This is around the central part of the US. For example, Indiana has longitudes around -84 to -88. I know that Indianapolis is in Indiana, and its coordinates are approximately 39.7684 latitude and -86.1581 longitude. That sounds very close to the given coordinates: 39.7771 and -86.1458.

Comparing:

- Given latitude: 39.7771

- Indianapolis latitude: about 39.7684 (very close)

- Given longitude: -86.1458

- Indianapolis longitude: about -86.1581 (also very close)

So, this is likely Indianapolis, Indiana.

To confirm, I should make sure there aren't other states nearby. Latitude 39.7771 is around the level of states like Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, etc. Longitude -86 is specifically in the eastern part of the Midwest.

- Ohio: longitudes around -80 to -84.5

- Indiana: longitudes from about -84.8 to -88.1

- Illinois: longitudes from about -87.5 to -91.5

Longitude -86.1458 falls within Indiana's range. Specifically, western Indiana might be around -87, and eastern around -84.8, so -86 is central Indiana.

Moreover, the latitude 39.7771 is consistent with central Indiana.

I can think about nearby cities or known points. Indianapolis is a major city, and its coordinates match closely.

Just to be thorough, let's check if this could be in another state. For example, Kentucky is south, with latitudes around 36-39, but longitude might overlap, but latitude 39.7771 is higher, so more north. Ohio is east, but longitude -86 is west of Ohio's -82 to -84.5 range. Wait, Ohio's western border is around -84.8, so -86 is west of that, in Indiana.

Longitude increases westward in the negative direction? No: longitude lines go east-west, but negative longitude means west. So, -84 is east of -86, since -84 is less negative.

Clarifying: Longitude -86 is west of -84. Because -86 is more negative, so further west.

Standard longitude: moving west, longitude decreases (becomes more negative).

- Ohio's longitude range: approximately -80.5 (east) to -84.8 (west)

- Indiana's: approximately -84.8 (east) to -88.1 (west)

So, longitude -86.1458 is between -84.8 and -88.1, so definitely in Indiana.

Latitude: Indiana's latitude range is about 37.8 to 41.8 north. 39.7771 is within that.

Specifically, Indianapolis is at about 39.77 N, -86.15 W, which matches.

So, the state is Indiana.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

My response should be helpful and clear. I can briefly explain how I arrived at the answer, but since the instruction is to reason step by step (in this simulation), I'll keep it concise in the actual response.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
