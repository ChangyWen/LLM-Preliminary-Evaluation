*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 36.2333 and longitude -115.2654 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are given: 36.2333 N and -115.2654 W. The negative longitude indicates it's west of the Prime Meridian, which is typical for the Americas.

I know that latitude 36.2333 is around 36 degrees north, and longitude -115.2654 is about 115 degrees west. This sounds familiar; I think this is in the western United States.

Let me recall the states in that area. Nevada is known for Las Vegas, and I think Las Vegas has coordinates around there. I believe Las Vegas is approximately at 36.1699 N, -115.1398 W. That's close but not exact.

The given latitude is 36.2333, and longitude is -115.2654. Let me see if this is still in Nevada.

Nevada's boundaries: It borders California to the west, Arizona and Utah to the east, Oregon and Idaho to the north, and a bit of something else. Longitude-wise, Nevada spans from about 114° to 120° W, and latitude from about 35° to 42° N. So, 36.2333 N and -115.2654 W should be within Nevada.

But to be precise, let's think about nearby cities or landmarks. Longitude -115.2654 is west of Las Vegas. Las Vegas is at about -115.14, so -115.2654 is a bit further west.

I think this might be in the area of North Las Vegas or something similar. Perhaps it's in Nevada.

To confirm, I should consider if it could be in another state. Adjacent states:

- To the west is California, which starts around longitude -120° or so, but Nevada's western border is around -120°, wait no.

Actually, Nevada's western border with California is along the 120th meridian in some parts, but it's irregular. Longitude -115 is east of that. Las Vegas is in southern Nevada, and longitude -115 is within Nevada.

Latitude 36.2333 is south of the 37th parallel, which might be a boundary, but Nevada extends south to about 35° N.

The 36th parallel is the boundary between some states. For example, the 36°30' parallel is part of the Missouri Compromise, but that's for eastern states. In the west, the boundary between Nevada and Arizona is along the Colorado River, not a simple latitude line.

Arizona is to the southeast of Nevada. The border between Nevada and Arizona follows the Colorado River, which is not straight.

But longitude -115.2654 W and latitude 36.2333 N: I think this is still in Nevada. Perhaps near the Spring Mountains or something.

I can think about the city. Latitude 36.2333 and longitude -115.2654 – if I calculate, 36.2333 is very close to 36.2333, which might be a specific point.

I recall that the coordinates for Las Vegas McCarran International Airport are around 36.0804 N, -115.1523 W, but that's not it.

Perhaps it's North Las Vegas. Upon second thought, I think 36.2333 N, -115.2654 W is likely in Nevada.

To be thorough, let's consider the bounding boxes.

Nevada: Min lat ~35.0018 N, max lat ~42.0022 N; min lon ~-120.006, max lon ~-114.004.

Longitude -115.2654 is between -120 and -114, yes. Latitude 36.2333 is between 35 and 42.

Now, check adjacent states:

- California: West of Nevada, longitudes more negative, like -114 to -124 or so. California's eastern border is with Nevada, around -114 to -120.

Specifically, the border between Nevada and California is mostly along longitude 120° W in the north, but in the south, it's different. Actually, southern Nevada's western border is with California along a line that includes parts of longitude 114-120.

Longitude -115.2654 W is within Nevada because Nevada's eastern border is with Utah and Arizona at around -114° W for parts.

Nevada's longitude range is approximately from 114°04' W to 120°00' W. So -115.2654 is between -114.04 and -120, yes.

Latitude 36.2333 is fine.

Now, is there any part where it might be in Arizona? Arizona's western border is with California and Nevada, but the Nevada-Arizona border is along the Colorado River, which is around longitude -114.5 or so in the south.

At latitude 36.2333 N, the Colorado River is the border. I think the river crosses latitude 36 at around longitude -114.5 or something.

Actually, Hoover Dam is at about 36.016 N, -114.737 W, which is on the border.

Given longitude -115.2654 W, which is more west (more negative) than -114.737, so it's west of the Colorado River, thus in Nevada, not Arizona.

Longitude -115.2654 is west of -114.737? No: -115.2654 is more negative, so it's further west.

Longitude increases westward when negative. No: in standard notation, longitude -115 is west of -114, since -115 is a larger magnitude west.

Numerically, -115.2654 is less than -114.737, but in terms of position, -115.2654 W is west of -114.737 W because the numbers are more negative.

Let's clarify: longitude lines: -114 W is east of -115 W. So -115.2654 W is west of -114.737 W.

Hoover Dam is at approx -114.737 W, which is longitude 114.737 W.

-115.2654 W is 115.2654 W, so numerically larger in magnitude, so further west.

The Colorado River border between Nevada and Arizona is around -114.5 to -114.8 or so in that area.

At latitude 36.2333 N, which is north of Hoover Dam (36.016 N), so further north.

The border follows the river, but at higher latitudes, Nevada extends west.

Actually, north of the Colorado River, the border between Nevada and Arizona is along the river until it meets the Utah border, but Utah is further east.

Perhaps I should look up the exact boundary.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I can assume that at longitude -115.2654 W and latitude 36.2333 N, it's likely in Nevada.

Moreover, I think this coordinate is very close to the location of Nellis Air Force Base or something in Nevada.

Perhaps it's in the Las Vegas area.

To confirm, I can think that the city of Las Vegas is at 36.1716 N, -115.1391 W, so given 36.2333 N is a bit north, and -115.2654 W is a bit west, so perhaps in the northwest part of the Las Vegas metropolitan area, still in Nevada.

Clark County, Nevada, includes Las Vegas and surrounding areas.

So, I believe it's in Nevada.

Now, the user asked for the state, and to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my answer should be Nevada.

But just to be absolutely sure, is there any chance it's in another state? For example, if it's exactly on the border, but -115.2654 W is well within Nevada.

Latitude 36.2333 N is not on any state border in that longitude.

So, I think it's safe.
