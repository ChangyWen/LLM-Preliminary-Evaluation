*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where a specific latitude and longitude are located. The coordinates given are latitude 30.442 and longitude -91.1311.

I need to recall that latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude measures north-south position, and longitude measures east-west. Negative longitude indicates west of the Prime Meridian, which is in the Western Hemisphere.

Latitude 30.442 is positive, so it's north of the equator. Longitude -91.1311 is negative, so it's west, likely in the Americas.

Now, I need to figure out which state in the US this is in. The coordinates seem to be in the US, probably, since the user is asking for a state. Let me think about where these coordinates might be.

Latitude around 30 degrees north could be in the southern US. For example, Florida is around 25-31 degrees north, Texas is around 26-36, Louisiana is around 29-33, etc.

Longitude -91 is west longitude. The US spans from about -67 (Maine) to -125 (Washington state). So -91 is somewhere in the central US.

Let me narrow it down:

- Longitude -90 is roughly the Mississippi River.

- Longitude -91 is just west of that.

Latitude 30.442 is about 30 degrees north.

I know that New Orleans, Louisiana, is around latitude 30 and longitude -90. Let me confirm that.

Upon thinking, New Orleans is approximately 29.95 N, 90.07 W. So latitude 30.442 is a bit north of New Orleans, and longitude -91.1311 is a bit west.

So, moving north and west from New Orleans.

Louisiana's capital is Baton Rouge, which I think is around there. Let me recall: Baton Rouge is approximately 30.45 N, 91.15 W. That sounds very close.

Let me verify the numbers: User gave 30.442 latitude and -91.1311 longitude. Baton Rouge is often cited as 30.4515 N, 91.1545 W or something similar. It's very close.

So, probably, this is in Louisiana.

But to be precise, I should confirm if it's exactly in Louisiana or perhaps in a neighboring state.

Neighboring states: East is Mississippi, west is Texas, north is Arkansas.

Longitude -91: Mississippi River is around -90 to -91, but Louisiana extends to about -94 longitude.

Arkansas starts around latitude 33 north, I think. Arkansas's southern border is around 33 N, but it dips down in some places.

Latitude 30.442 is quite south. The southern US states like Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama are in that latitude.

Longitude -91.1311: Let's see the state boundaries.

I can think of major cities or use general knowledge.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll assume I don't have real-time access to a map, but based on memory.

Latitude 30.442 N, longitude -91.1311 W.

- Baton Rouge, LA: approx 30.45 N, 91.18 W â€“ very close.

- Perhaps it's exactly Baton Rouge or nearby.

To confirm the state: Louisiana.

Is there any chance it's in another state? For example, if it's on the border.

But 30.442 N is south of Arkansas's border. Arkansas's southernmost point is around 33 N, I believe. Wait, no: Louisiana's northern border with Arkansas is around 33 N, but latitude decreases south, so 30 N is deep in Louisiana.

Latitude increases north, so 30 N is south, 33 N is north.

US states:

- Louisiana: latitudes from about 29 N (south) to 33 N (north).

- At longitude -91, which is west of Mississippi River.

Mississippi state is east of the river, so longitude around -88 to -91 or so, but mostly east.

Mississippi River longitude varies, but around Baton Rouge, it's -91 W.

West of the river is Louisiana.

So, longitude -91.1311 W should be in Louisiana.

To be thorough, let's think about the exact location.

I can recall that the coordinates are likely for Baton Rouge, which is the capital of Louisiana.

So, the state should be Louisiana.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should conclude with the state name.
