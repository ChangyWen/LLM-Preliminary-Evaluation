*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 33.5722 and longitude -112.0892 is located. I need to determine which US state this corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are coordinates. Latitude 33.5722 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -112.0892 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the US has states in various latitudes and longitudes. Latitude 33 is roughly around the southern US, like parts of Arizona, New Mexico, or Texas. Longitude -112 is in the western US.

Let me think about specific states:

- Arizona has longitudes around -109 to -114 and latitudes from about 31 to 37. Phoenix, Arizona, is a major city, and I think its coordinates are close to this.

I believe Phoenix, Arizona, has coordinates approximately 33.45 latitude and -112.07 longitude. Let me check that.

Upon recalling, yes, Phoenix is at about 33.4484° N, 112.0740° W. The given coordinates are 33.5722 N and -112.0892 W. That's very close to Phoenix.

33.5722 vs 33.4484 – that's a difference of about 0.1238 degrees in latitude. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.1238 degrees is roughly 13.7 km. Similarly, longitude difference: -112.0892 vs -112.0740 is about 0.0152 degrees. 1 degree of longitude at this latitude is about 111 km * cos(33.5722°) ≈ 111 * 0.832 ≈ 92.3 km, so 0.0152 degrees is about 1.4 km.

So, the given point is very close to Phoenix, Arizona, probably within the city or nearby.

Now, to confirm the state: Arizona is the state that contains Phoenix.

But I should make sure there are no boundary issues. Is this exactly on a state border? Longitude -112 is right around Arizona. Arizona's western border is at about -114.8, eastern at -109, northern at 37, southern at 31.5. Latitude 33.5722 is well within Arizona's range.

Moreover, longitude -112.0892: Arizona spans from about -109.045 to -114.818, so -112 is central Arizona.

Nearest cities: Phoenix is at -112.074, so very close. Other states: California is west, starting around -114, but California's eastern border is around -114. something, wait no:

- California's longitude: from about -114.13 (southeast) to -124.41 (northwest).

Arizona's western border is with California, and the border is along the Colorado River, which might have specific coordinates.

But -112.0892 is east of that. The point is at -112.0892, which is longitude 112.0892 W.

California's easternmost point is around -114.13 for the southern part, but actually, the border with Arizona is at approximately -114.5 or so for the southern section, but it varies.

The Arizona-California border is along the Colorado River, and at latitude 33-34, it's around longitude -114.5 to -114.8 or something. I need better recall.

I know that Phoenix is unambiguously in Arizona, and the coordinates given are very close to Phoenix.

To be precise, I can think about the exact location. Latitude 33.5722 N, longitude -112.0892 W.

If I were to use a map or knowledge, this is likely in Maricopa County, Arizona, which includes Phoenix.

Perhaps it's a specific suburb or area, but the state is definitely Arizona.

Just to double-check, is there any chance it's in another state? Nevada is north and west, but Nevada's southern border is at about latitude 35-37, and longitude from -114 to -120. Nevada's eastern border is with Utah and Arizona, but Arizona and Nevada share a border at the Colorado River as well, but further north.

The Arizona-Nevada border is at the Colorado River, around latitude 36, which is north of 33.57. So at latitude 33.57, it's deep in Arizona, not near Nevada.

Similarly, Utah is east, New Mexico is east, Mexico is south.

So, no doubt, it's in Arizona.

Therefore, the state is Arizona.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be helpful, perhaps explain a bit, but end with the answer.

Final answer: Arizona

Make sure the format. "in a new line at the end", so probably just write it on a new line.

Also, ensure it's clear.
