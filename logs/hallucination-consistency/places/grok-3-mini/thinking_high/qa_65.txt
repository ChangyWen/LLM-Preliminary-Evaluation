*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.5961 and longitude -75.4756 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are given: 40.5961 N and -75.4756 W. The negative longitude indicates it's west of the Prime Meridian, which is typical for locations in the Americas.

I recall that latitude 40 is around the level of New York City or Philadelphia. Longitude -75 is also in that area. Let me think about major cities:

- New York City is approximately 40.7128 N, -74.0060 W.

- Philadelphia is about 39.9526 N, -75.1652 W.

The given latitude is 40.5961, which is a bit north of Philadelphia, and longitude -75.4756, which is west of Philadelphia.

Philadelphia's longitude is -75.1652, so -75.4756 is more negative, meaning further west.

Now, considering states in that region: Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, etc.

Latitude 40.5961 and longitude -75.4756 sounds familiar. I think this might be Allentown, Pennsylvania. Let me confirm that.

From my knowledge, Allentown, PA has coordinates around 40.6084 N, -75.4903 W. That's very close to 40.5961 N and -75.4756 W. Probably the same place or very nearby.

So, if it's Allentown, it's in Pennsylvania.

To be thorough, I should consider if it could be in another state. The longitude -75.4756 is west of the Hudson River, so it's likely in Pennsylvania, not New Jersey or New York.

New Jersey's eastern border is around longitude -74 to -75, but -75.4756 is probably in PA.

I can think about state boundaries. Pennsylvania's eastern border is along the Delaware River, which is around longitude -75.

Yes, Allentown is in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania.

To double-check, I can think about nearby cities. For example, if it were slightly east, it might be in New Jersey, but -75.4756 is west of that.

Longitude increases westward when negative, so -75.4756 is west of -75.1652 (Philadelphia).

Philadelphia is at -75.1652, so -75.4756 is about 0.31 degrees west. Since 1 degree of longitude is roughly 69 miles at that latitude, 0.31 degrees is about 21 miles west of Philadelphia.

West of Philadelphia, still in Pennsylvania, towards areas like Norristown or further to Allentown.

Allentown is about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, which matches.

I can confirm that the coordinate is indeed in PA.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be clear and direct.

Finally, state the answer: Pennsylvania.

I should make sure it's not in another state. For example, is there any part of New Jersey or Delaware that could have this longitude? Delaware is further south, latitude around 39, so no. New Jersey's western border is the Delaware River, so longitudes around -75 might be on the border, but latitude 40.5961 is north, so it's PA.

Yes, definitely Pennsylvania.
