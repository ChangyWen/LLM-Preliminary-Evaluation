*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.0077 and longitude -75.1339 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 40.0077 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -75.1339 is in the Western Hemisphere, since it's negative.

I recall that the United States has various states with different coordinates. Longitude -75 is around the East Coast. For example, New York City is around 40.7128 latitude and -74.0060 longitude, which is close but not exact.

Let me think about Philadelphia. I believe Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania, and its coordinates are approximately 39.9526 latitude and -75.1652 longitude. That's very close to 40.0077 and -75.1339.

Calculating the difference: Latitude 40.0077 vs 39.9526 is a difference of about 0.0551 degrees. Longitude -75.1339 vs -75.1652 is a difference of about 0.0313 degrees.

Each degree of latitude is about 111 kilometers, so 0.0551 degrees is roughly 6.12 km. For longitude, it varies, but at 40 degrees latitude, one degree is about 85-90 km, so 0.0313 degrees is around 2.7-2.8 km. So the point is very close to Philadelphia, probably within the city or nearby.

Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania. So, the state should be Pennsylvania.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this exact coordinate is still in Pennsylvania or if it might be in a neighboring state. Neighboring states to Pennsylvania include New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, etc.

New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, across the Delaware River. Longitude -75.1339 is west of -75, and Philadelphia is on the eastern side of Pennsylvania. Actually, longitude increases as you go west in the negative scale, but -75.1339 is slightly east of Philadelphia's approximate center.

Standard Philadelphia coordinates are about -75.1652, which is more west than -75.1339. Longitude -75.1339 is less negative, so it's east of -75.1652. On the number line, -75.1339 is greater than -75.1652, so it's east.

Confirming: Lower longitude numbers (more negative) are west, higher (less negative) are east. So -75.1339 is east of -75.1652.

Philadelphia's center is at about -75.1652, so -75.1339 is about 0.0313 degrees east, which is roughly 2.7 km east. Philadelphia spans a range, and the Delaware River is to the east.

The Delaware River forms the border between Pennsylvania and New Jersey. If this coordinate is east of the river, it might be in New Jersey.

I need to be precise. Let me recall or estimate the coordinates of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey border.

The Delaware River's longitude varies, but around Philadelphia, it's roughly around -75.1 to -75.2 or so. I should look this up, but since I'm an AI, I can recall or reason.

I know that the Benjamin Franklin Bridge or areas in Philadelphia might have coordinates around there. Perhaps I can think of famous landmarks.

Since the coordinates are very close to Philadelphia's known coordinates, and Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania, it's likely in PA. But to be accurate, let's assume I have access to knowledge.

From my training data, latitude 40.0077 and longitude -75.1339 is approximately the location of the Philadelphia Zoo or something similar. Actually, I think it's near the center of Philadelphia.

Upon second thought, I can use a reverse geocoding approach in my mind. Common knowledge: Latitude 40.0077 N, Longitude 75.1339 W.

I recall that the White House in DC is at 38.8977, -77.0365, which is south and west. New York is north.

Perhaps I can compare to known points.

I know that the state of Pennsylvania includes Philadelphia, and the coordinates given are within the metro area.

To confirm, let's think about the exact location. If I were to plot this, latitude 40.0077 is slightly north of Philadelphia's center (39.9526), wait no, 40.0077 is higher than 39.9526, so it's north.

39.9526 to 40.0077 is a difference of 0.0551 degrees north. Philadelphia's latitude range: the city extends from about 39.9 to 40.1 or so.

Actually, northern Philadelphia might be around 40.05 or something. Let me correct.

Standard Philadelphia city hall is at approximately 39.9526 N, 75.1652 W. But latitude 40.0077 is about 40.0077 - 39.9526 = 0.0551 degrees north, which is about 6 km north.

Philadelphia's northern boundary: I think it goes up to about 40.1 or so. For example, the Philadelphia neighborhood of Chestnut Hill is around 40.05 N.

Upon better recollection, latitude 40.0077 N and longitude -75.1339 W is likely in the Germantown area or something in Philadelphia, still within Pennsylvania.

Longitude -75.1339 vs -75.1652 is 0.0313 degrees east, about 2.7 km east.

The Delaware River is at approximately -75.12 to -75.14 in some parts near Philadelphia. Actually, the river's longitude: the Benjamin Franklin Bridge crosses at around -75.13 or so.

I think the coordinate 40.0077, -75.1339 might be very close to the river or possibly on the New Jersey side.

This is tricky. Perhaps I should assume it's in Pennsylvania unless specified.

I can think of it as the location of Temple University or something. Temple University in Philadelphia is at about 39.98 N, -75.15 W or so.

Let's calculate: 40.0077 N is north of that.

Perhaps it's in the Fairmount Park area.

To resolve this, I can use the fact that most of Philadelphia is west of the river, but the river is the border.

Upon standard knowledge, latitude 40.0077 N, longitude -75.1339 W is within Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. For example, if I recall, this might be near the Art Museum or something.

The Philadelphia Museum of Art is at approximately 39.9655 N, 75.1813 W, which is south and west.

Perhaps it's north. Let's estimate.

I can use online tools in my mind, but since I'm AI, I know that reverse geocoding for 40.0077, -75.1339 points to Philadelphia, PA.

In fact, I believe this coordinate is within the city limits of Philadelphia, which is in Pennsylvania.

To be precise, the state is Pennsylvania.

Just to double-check, is there any chance it's in Delaware or New Jersey? Delaware is south, around 39.7 N, and New Jersey is east, but across the river.

The longitude -75.1339: the Delaware River at latitude 40.0077 might be around -75.13 or so. Actually, at 40 N, the river is a bit west.

I think the coordinate is still in PA. For instance, if I think of coordinates, 40.0077 N, -75.1339 W is likely in the Manayunk neighborhood or something, still in Philly.

So, I think it's safe to say Pennsylvania.

Finally, the user asked for the final answer in a new line at the end. So I'll respond with the reasoning and then the answer.
