*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 30.3322 and longitude -81.6749 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 30.3322 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -81.6749 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different coordinates. Longitude -81 is roughly in the eastern part of the US. For example, Florida is known for having latitudes around 25 to 31 degrees north and longitudes from about -80 to -87 degrees west.

Let me think about Florida specifically. Jacksonville, Florida, is a city I know. I think its coordinates are around 30.3322 N and -81.6749 W. That sounds familiar. I should confirm if that's accurate.

Upon thinking, yes, I believe 30.3322 latitude and -81.6749 longitude correspond to Jacksonville, Florida. Jacksonville is in the northeastern part of Florida.

To be thorough, I should consider if this could be in another state. Latitude 30.3322 is about 30 degrees north, which is consistent with southern states like Florida, Georgia, or even parts of Alabama or Mississippi, but the longitude -81.6749 is key.

Longitude -81 is west, so:

- Florida's east coast has longitudes around -80 to -81.

- Georgia is a bit west, around -81 to -85.

But latitude 30.3322 is quite south. Georgia's southern border is around 30-31 degrees north, but Jacksonville is right on the border or just south.

Actually, the city of Jacksonville, Florida, straddles the St. Johns River and is known for its coordinates being approximately 30.3322 N, 81.6749 W. I think that's standard.

To double-check, I can think about nearby cities or landmarks. For example, if it's near the Atlantic Ocean, which it should be, as longitude -81 is close to the coast.

Yes, Florida's Atlantic coast has cities like Miami (around 25.76 N, -80.19 W), Orlando (28.54 N, -81.38 W), and Jacksonville is further north.

Orlando is at about 28.5 N, 81.4 W, so Jacksonville at 30.3 N, 81.7 W makes sense as it's north of Orlando.

Now, is there any part of Georgia or another state at this exact coordinate? The state line between Florida and Georgia is around 30.75 N or something, but I think Jacksonville is firmly in Florida.

Actually, the Florida-Georgia border is along the St. Marys River, and Jacksonville is south of that, so definitely in Florida.

Moreover, longitude -81.6749 is very close to the coordinates I recall for Jacksonville.

So, the state should be Florida.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So I need to structure my response accordingly.

I should keep my response clear and not verbose, as per the instruction.

So, perhaps I can say something like: "Based on the given latitude and longitude, the location is in the state of Florida."

Then, on a new line, just "Florida".

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I can have a brief explanation and then the answer.

Finally, confirm: Latitude 30.3322 N, Longitude -81.6749 W is indeed Jacksonville, Florida, USA.

Yes.
