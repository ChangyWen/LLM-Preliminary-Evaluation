*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 39.7805 and longitude -84.2003 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

I know that latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 39.7805 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -84.2003 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere, likely in North America.

To find the state, I should recall or look up which states are around these coordinates. I don't have real-time access to external databases, so I need to use my knowledge.

Latitude 39.7805 is around 40 degrees north. I know that:

- New York City is about 40.7128 N, so this is similar.

- But longitude -84.2003 is about 84 degrees west.

New York City is around -74 longitude, so this is further west.

Considering the US, states in the Midwest or Ohio area might fit.

I think Ohio has cities around there. For example, Columbus, Ohio is approximately 40 N and -83 W. Let me recall:

- Columbus, Ohio: latitude about 39.9612 N, longitude -82.9988 W.

The given latitude is 39.7805, which is close to 40, and longitude -84.2003.

-84 is a bit west of -83, so perhaps it's in western Ohio or nearby.

I think Dayton, Ohio is around there. Let me think: Dayton is known for being in Ohio, and I believe its coordinates are close.

Upon recalling, Dayton, Ohio has coordinates approximately 39.7589 N, -84.1916 W. That sounds very close to 39.7805 N, -84.2003 W.

Let me compare:

Given: 39.7805 N, -84.2003 W

Dayton: approximately 39.7589 N, -84.1916 W

Difference in latitude: 39.7805 - 39.7589 = 0.0216 degrees. Since 1 degree latitude is about 111 km, 0.0216 degrees is roughly 2.4 km.

Longitude difference: -84.2003 - (-84.1916) = -0.0087 degrees. 1 degree longitude at this latitude is about 111 km * cos(40°) ≈ 111 * 0.766 ≈ 85 km, so 0.0087 degrees is about 0.74 km.

So, the given point is very close to Dayton, Ohio, probably within a few kilometers.

Therefore, it's likely in Ohio.

But to be precise, I should confirm if this exact point is in Ohio or perhaps in a neighboring state.

Neighboring states to Ohio include Indiana to the west, Kentucky to the south, etc.

Longitude -84.2003: Indiana's western border is around -87 to -86, I think. No:

Ohio's western border is along the Indiana border. The border between Ohio and Indiana is approximately at longitude -84.8 or something? Wait no.

Actually, the western border of Ohio is irregular, but around Cincinnati, which is in the southwest, longitude is about -84.5, and Dayton is further east.

Dayton is in western Ohio, and its longitude is around -84.2, which is still within Ohio.

The border with Indiana: Indiana starts west of Ohio. The state line is roughly at longitude -84.82 for the northern part, but it jogs.

Actually, upon thinking, Dayton is definitely in Ohio, and coordinates around -84.2 are well within Ohio.

Latitude 39.78 is south of Columbus, which is at 40, and north of Cincinnati, which is at about 39.1.

Cincinnati is 39.1031 N, -84.5120 W.

So, latitude 39.78 is between Cincinnati and Columbus, and longitude -84.20 is east of Cincinnati's -84.51, so yes, in the central part of Ohio.

Moreover, I can think of other cities: for example, if it were in Kentucky, Kentucky's northern border is the Ohio River, and latitudes around 39 are possible, but longitude -84.2 would be east, probably in Ohio.

Kentucky's longitude ranges from about -81.9 to -89.5, so -84.2 is within, but the northern part near Ohio River.

However, the Ohio River border: at longitude -84.2, the river is the border, but Dayton is inland, not on the river.

Actually, the point 39.7805, -84.2003 is likely on land in Ohio.

I could consider the exact location. Since it's very close to Dayton, and Dayton is a city in Ohio, it's safe to say it's in Ohio.

But to be thorough, perhaps I can think if there's any chance it's in another state.

Indiana: Indiana's eastern border is with Ohio, and longitudes start from about -84.8 to -88. something. Wait, the easternmost point of Indiana is around -84.8 W, I think near the Ohio border.

Actually, the border between Ohio and Indiana is not a straight line; it follows the Greenville Treaty Line or something, but generally, longitude -84.2 is east of that border.

For example, Richmond, Indiana is near the border, at about 39.828 N, -84.890 W, which is longitude -84.89, west of -84.2.

Longitude decreases as you go west, so -84.89 is more west than -84.2.

Numerically, -84.89 is less than -84.2, but in terms of position, higher negative longitude is further west.

Standard: longitude -84.2 is east of -84.89.

Let's clarify:

- Longitude -84.2 means 84.2 degrees west.

- Longitude -84.89 means 84.89 degrees west, so further west.

So, Ohio's western border: in the north, it's around longitude -84.82 W for the state line with Michigan and Indiana, but actually, Ohio-Indiana border varies.

Upon better recollection, the city of Dayton is at -84.19, and the Indiana border is further west, around -84.8 or so in some parts.

For instance, the point directly west of Dayton would cross into Indiana, but at latitude 39.78, the border is approximately at longitude -84.82 W or something.

I think Dayton is about 20-30 miles from the Indiana border.

Given that the coordinates are very close to known Dayton coordinates, and Dayton is unambiguously in Ohio, I can conclude it's in Ohio.

Moreover, the user might be referring to a specific place, but based on the coordinates, it's in Ohio.

Finally, the response should be just the state name, in a new line at the end.

So, my answer is Ohio.

But to make sure, perhaps I can think if there's any other possibility.

Another way: I know that latitude 39-40 N and longitude -80 to -85 W is roughly Ohio, Pennsylvania, etc., but -84 is central.

Yes.

So, I'm confident.
