*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 41.0798 and longitude -81.5219 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are given: 41.0798 N and -81.5219 W. The negative longitude indicates it's west of the Prime Meridian, which is typical for the Americas.

I recall that latitude 41 is roughly in the northern part of the US, and longitude -81 is around the eastern part. Let me think about the states in that area.

Longitude -81 is close to the eastern seaboard. For example, New York City is around -74, so -81 is further west. Ohio has longitudes around -80 to -84. I think Akron, Ohio is in that area.

I remember that Akron, Ohio has coordinates approximately 41.0814 N, -81.5190 W. That looks very close to 41.0798 N, -81.5219 W. So, this is probably in Ohio.

To confirm, let's think about nearby states:

- Pennsylvania is to the east, with longitudes around -75 to -80.

- Ohio is between -80.5 to -84.8 longitude, and latitudes from 38.4 to 42.3 N.

- Latitude 41.0798 is within Ohio's range.

- Longitude -81.5219 is also within Ohio's western boundary.

Now, to be precise, I can think about cities. Akron is in Summit County, Ohio, and its coordinates match closely.

I should consider if it could be in another state. For example, West Virginia or Pennsylvania, but their longitudes don't match. West Virginia is around -80 to -82, but latitude might be lower. Latitude 41 is more northern, so probably not West Virginia.

Pennsylvania goes up to about latitude 42, but longitude -81 is too far west for Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania's western border is around -80.5, so -81 is west of that, into Ohio.

Yes, the border between Pennsylvania and Ohio is around longitude -80.5. So -81.5219 is definitely in Ohio.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end. So I need to structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and direct. I can say something like: "Based on the given coordinates, the location is in Ohio."

Then, end with the answer on a new line.
