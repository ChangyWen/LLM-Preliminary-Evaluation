*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 32.7817 and longitude -97.3474 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 32.7817 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -97.3474 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different latitude and longitude ranges. I need to figure out which state this falls into.

Longitude -97 is around the central part of the US. For example, Texas has longitudes from about -93 to -107, and latitudes from about 26 to 36. Let me think about Texas specifically.

I know that Dallas, Texas, is around latitude 32.7767 and longitude -96.7970. The given coordinates are 32.7817 latitude and -97.3474 longitude. That's very close to 32.7767, which is Dallas, but the longitude is -97.3474, which is a bit west of -96.7970.

-97.3474 is more west. I think Fort Worth, Texas, is near there. I believe Fort Worth has coordinates around 32.7555 latitude and -97.3302 longitude. Let me compare:

Given: 32.7817 N, -97.3474 W

Fort Worth: Approximately 32.75 N, -97.33 W. Yeah, that's very close. 32.7817 is about 32.78, and -97.3474 is about -97.35, so it's likely in the Fort Worth area.

Fort Worth is in Texas. So, probably, this location is in Texas.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this could be in another state. The latitude 32.7817 is around the same as Dallas, which is in Texas, and longitude -97.3474 is still within Texas borders.

Texas's western border is around longitude -106, and eastern is around -94 or so, but more precisely, the panhandle goes west, but at latitude 32.7817, which is central Texas, longitude -97 should be well within Texas.

Neighboring states: To the north is Oklahoma, which starts around latitude 34 or so, but Oklahoma's southern border is around latitude 33.5 to 34, I think. Actually, the Red River forms the border, and at longitude -97, the border might be around there.

Longitude -97 crosses several states. For example, it goes through North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.

But at latitude 32.7817, which is quite south. Kansas is around 37-40 latitude, Oklahoma is 34-37, and Texas goes down to 26.

So, at latitude 32.7817, longitude -97 should be in Texas. Specifically, the area around Fort Worth.

I can think about the coordinates: 32.7817 N, -97.3474 W. This is very close to the known coordinates of Fort Worth, Texas.

In fact, if I recall, Fort Worth International Airport or something might have similar coords, but even if not exact, it's in the metro area.

So, the state is Texas.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be helpful, perhaps explain a bit, but keep it concise, and end with the answer.

Final answer: Texas

To be precise, I should just state it.

I could say: Based on the latitude and longitude provided, the location is in the state of Texas.

And then, on a new line, "Texas"

The instruction is: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I'll write a short explanation and then the answer.
