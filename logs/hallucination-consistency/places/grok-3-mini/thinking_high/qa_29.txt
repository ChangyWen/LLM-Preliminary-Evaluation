*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 37.3012 and longitude -121.848 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are coordinates on Earth. Latitude 37.3012 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -121.848 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the US has various states, and I need to pinpoint which one this is in. Latitude 37.3012 is around the same as San Francisco or Los Angeles, which are both in California. Longitude -121.848 seems plausible for California as well, since California is on the west coast.

Let me think about specific cities. I know that San Jose, California, is around there. I think San Jose has coordinates approximately 37.3387 latitude and -121.8853 longitude. That's close to 37.3012 and -121.848.

Calculating the difference: Latitude difference is 37.3387 - 37.3012 = 0.0375 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.0375 degrees is roughly 4.16 km. Longitude difference: -121.8853 - (-121.848) = -0.0373 degrees. At latitude 37, 1 degree longitude is about 85 km (since it decreases towards poles), so 0.0373 degrees is about 3.17 km. So, it's very close to San Jose.

San Jose is definitely in California. But to be thorough, I should confirm if this exact coordinate is still in California or perhaps on a border.

Looking at the coordinates: Latitude 37.3012 N, Longitude 121.848 W. California borders Nevada to the east, but Nevada is more eastward. Longitude -121.848 is west, so it should be well within California.

Other states nearby: Oregon is north, but its southern border is around latitude 42, which is higher than 37. Arizona is southeast, but its western part is around longitude -114, which is east of -121. So, -121 is definitely in California.

I can think about the bounding boxes of states. California's latitude range is from about 32.5 to 42 N, and longitude from about -114.5 to -124.4 W. Longitude -121.848 is between -114.5 and -124.4, and latitude 37.3012 is between 32.5 and 42, so yes, it's in California.

Moreover, specifically, this is in the San Francisco Bay Area, likely in Santa Clara County or nearby.

But the question is just for the state, not the city or county.

So, my final answer should be California.

The user said to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I need to structure my response accordingly.

I should keep my response clear and not verbose, as per the instruction.

Response structure: I can briefly explain how I determined it, but since the user didn't ask for reasoning, I might just state it. However, as an AI, providing a bit of context is helpful, but I'll keep it concise.

Final answer: California

Make sure it's in a new line.
