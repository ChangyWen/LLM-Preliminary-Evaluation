*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 43.0642 and longitude -87.9675 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are coordinates on Earth. Latitude 43.0642 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -87.9675 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the US has various states with different latitude and longitude ranges. Latitude 43 is roughly in the northern part of the US, possibly around the Great Lakes or Midwest.

Longitude -87 is around the area of Chicago or Milwaukee. I think Chicago is around 41.8781 latitude and -87.6298 longitude. That's close but not exact.

The given latitude is 43.0642, which is higher than Chicago's 41.8781, so it's further north. Longitude -87.9675 is very close to -87.6298, so same longitude ballpark.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is around there. I think Milwaukee's coordinates are approximately 43.0389 latitude and -87.9067 longitude. Let me compare:

- Given: 43.0642 N, -87.9675 W

- Milwaukee: Approximately 43.0389 N, -87.9067 W

That's very close. The difference in latitude is about 0.0253 degrees, and in longitude about -0.0608 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.0253 degrees is roughly 2.8 km. For longitude, at latitude 43, 1 degree is about 111 km * cos(43°) ≈ 111 * 0.7317 ≈ 81.2 km, so 0.0608 degrees is about 4.94 km. So, this point is very close to Milwaukee, probably within the city or nearby.

Milwaukee is in Wisconsin. So, the state should be Wisconsin.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this exact coordinate is indeed in Wisconsin and not in a neighboring state. Wisconsin borders Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota.

- Illinois is south, around latitude 41-42.

- Michigan is east, but Upper Peninsula might be around similar latitudes, but longitude: Michigan's Lower Peninsula is around -84 to -86, which is east of -87. -87 is west of that.

Longitude -87 is further west. Wisconsin's longitude ranges from about -86.5 to -92.9. Milwaukee is at -87.9, which is within Wisconsin.

Neighboring states:

- To the east is Lake Michigan, not a state.

- South is Illinois, but Illinois latitudes are lower, around 42 max for the north part.

- West is Minnesota and Iowa, but their longitudes: Minnesota starts around -89.5 or so, but latitudes: Minnesota has parts up to 49, but at longitude -87, it should be Wisconsin.

I can think about the coordinate: 43.0642 N, -87.9675 W.

I know that the boundary between Wisconsin and Illinois is around latitude 42.5, I think. Actually, the state line is at 42.30 N for part of it, but Wisconsin extends north.

Wisconsin's southern border is with Illinois, and the latitude there is around 42.5 N. For example, Chicago is 41.8781, and the state line is north of that. Wisconsin starts at about 42.49 N at the state line.

Given latitude 43.0642 is well north of 42.5, so definitely in Wisconsin.

Longitude -87.9675: Wisconsin's eastern border is Lake Michigan, so as long as it's west of the lake, it's in Wisconsin. Milwaukee is on the lake, so this should be fine.

I could use a quick mental map or recall that this is standard for Milwaukee.

To be extra sure, I can think about famous places. Latitude 43.0642 and longitude -87.9675— I think this might be very close to the location of the Milwaukee Art Museum or something, but I don't need that level of detail.

So, the state is Wisconsin.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be helpful, perhaps explain a bit, but keep it concise, and end with the answer.

Final answer: Wisconsin

Make sure it's a state. Yes, Wisconsin is a US state.

Is there any chance it's in Canada? Latitude 43 is south of the US-Canada border in that region. The border is at 49 N, so no.

Perfect.
