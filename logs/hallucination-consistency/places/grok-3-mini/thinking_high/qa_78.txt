*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 42.6664 and longitude -73.7987 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate falls into.

I know that latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 42.6664 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -73.7987 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere, likely in North America.

To find the state, I should recall the boundaries of US states. Longitude -73 is around the eastern part of the US. For example, New York City is around 40.7 latitude and -74 longitude, so this is a bit north and east of that.

Latitude 42.6664 is higher than New York City's 40.7, so it's further north. Longitude -73.7987 is slightly east of -74, meaning it's a bit west of New York City? No, negative longitude increases as you go west, so -73 is west of -74? Let's clarify:

Longitude: -74 is west of -73 because -74 is a larger negative number, so it's further west. Actually, in longitude, more negative means further west. So -73 is east of -74. For example, New York City is about -74, and Boston is around -71, so -73 is between them.

Standard knowledge:

- New York City: approx. 40.7°N, 74°W

- So longitude -74 is NYC area.

- Latitude 42.6664 is around the level of upstate New York or perhaps Massachusetts or Vermont.

I think Albany, New York is around there. Let me recall: Albany is the capital of New York, and I believe it's at about 42.65°N and -73.75°W or something close.

Let me verify that. From memory, Albany, NY is approximately 42.6526°N, 73.7562°W. The given coordinates are 42.6664°N, -73.7987°W.

Comparing:

- Latitude: 42.6664 vs. 42.6526 – very close, about 0.0138 degrees difference. Since 1 degree latitude is about 111 km, 0.0138 degrees is roughly 1.53 km, so very nearby.

- Longitude: -73.7987 vs. -73.7562 – difference of about 0.0425 degrees. 1 degree longitude at this latitude is about 111 km * cos(42.6664°) ≈ 111 * 0.737 ≈ 82 km, so 0.0425 * 82 ≈ 3.485 km, so also very close.

So, this point is very near Albany, New York.

Albany is in New York state, so probably this coordinate is in New York.

But to be precise, I should confirm if it's exactly in New York or perhaps in a neighboring state.

Neighboring states: To the east is Massachusetts and Vermont, to the north is Vermont, to the west is other parts of New York.

The longitude -73.7987 is west of the border with Massachusetts. I think the border between New York and Massachusetts is around longitude -73.5 or something? No.

Actually, the New York-Massachusetts border is not straight, but generally, Albany is well within New York. The Hudson River and other features.

I can think about the coordinate: latitude 42.6664, longitude -73.7987.

I know that the 42nd parallel runs through New York, Vermont, etc.

Specifically, for longitude -73.8, that's around the eastern part of New York state.

To double-check, I can recall that the state of Vermont starts around longitude -73. Let me think about Burlington, VT, which is around 44.5°N, -73.2°W, so further north and east.

Burlington is at -73.2, which is east of -73.8, since -73.2 is less negative.

Longitude: -73.8 is more west than -73.2 because -73.8 < -73.2 numerically, but in geography, more negative longitude is further west.

Standard: longitude increases eastward from -180 to 180, but since it's negative, -73.8 is west of -73.2.

Example: New York City -74, Philadelphia -75, so more negative is further west.

-73.8 is west of -73.2.

Burlington, VT is at approximately 44.48°N, 73.21°W, so longitude -73.21.

The given longitude is -73.7987, which is about -73.80, so much more west.

Difference: -73.80 vs. -73.21, so -73.80 is 0.59 degrees west of -73.21.

At latitude 44, 1 degree longitude is about 82 km, so 0.59 * 82 ≈ 48.4 km west.

But the latitude is different; given is 42.6664, while Burlington is 44.48, so south.

Perhaps better to look at the area around latitude 42.6664.

At latitude 42.6664, longitude around -73.8.

I know that the city of Albany is at 42.65, -73.75, as I said.

Now, the state borders: New York shares a border with Vermont to the east, and the border is along the eastern edge.

The New York-Vermont border is roughly along longitude -73.3 or something? No.

Actually, the border between New York and Vermont follows the western bank of Lake Champlain and then a straight line.

Lake Champlain is around longitude -73.3 to -73.4.

Burlington is on Lake Champlain at -73.21, and Albany is at -73.75, so the border is east of Albany.

Albany is at -73.75, and the New York-Vermont border is further east.

The westernmost point of Vermont is around -73.45 or so, I think.

Upon thinking, the city of Troy, NY, is near Albany, and it's in New York.

Perhaps I can estimate.

Since the coordinate is very close to Albany's known coordinates, and Albany is unambiguously in New York, it's safe to say it's in New York.

But to be thorough, let's consider if it could be in Massachusetts.

Massachusetts is east of New York, and its western border is with New York and Vermont.

The Massachusetts-New York border is around longitude -73.5 or so in some parts.

For example, the town of Williamstown, MA, is near the border, at about 42.7°N, -73.2°W or something.

Williamstown, MA is approximately 42.706°N, 73.204°W.

So longitude -73.204, which is east of -73.7987.

Given longitude -73.7987 is more west, so west of -73.204.

Since -73.7987 < -73.204, it's further west, so in New York, not Massachusetts.

Similarly, for Vermont, the southern part is around latitude 42.7, but longitude starts from about -73.15 or so for the border.

The New York-Vermont border at latitude 42.6664: I think it's west of that.

Actually, at latitude 42.6664, which is south of where the border might be.

The straight part of the New York-Vermont border is from about 44°N down to 42.75°N or something? No, Vermont's southern border is with Massachusetts and a bit with Connecticut, but with New York, it's the western border.

Vermont is bordered by New York to the west, Massachusetts to the south, etc.

The New York-Vermont border runs north-south along the western side of Vermont.

At latitude 42.6664, which is quite south, the border between New York and Vermont is further north.

Vermont's southernmost point is around 42.726°N at the Massachusetts border, but the New York-Vermont border starts north of that.

Actually, New York and Vermont share a border that is mostly along the 44th parallel in the north, but it zigzags.

Perhaps better to think that at latitude 42.6664, which is about the same as Albany, and Albany is deep in New York state, far from any border.

The distance: from Albany to the Vermont border is about 50-60 km east, I think.

Since the coordinate is very close to Albany, and Albany is at -73.75, and the border with Vermont is around -73.3 or east, so -73.8 is well west.

Longitude -73.8 is west of Albany's -73.75? No: Albany is -73.7562, given is -73.7987, which is more negative, so slightly west.

But still, Albany area is all New York.

Perhaps this coordinate is in the town of Albany or nearby.

I can assume that since it's so close, it's in New York.

To confirm, I can think about the exact location.

Another way: I know that latitude 42.6664 and longitude -73.7987 might be plotted on a map, but since I can't do that, I'll rely on memory.

Perhaps it's near the Albany International Airport or something.

But I think it's safe to conclude it's in New York state.

The user asked for the state, and to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should be: I need to reason step by step, which I did, and then give the answer.

Finally, the state is New York.

Is there any chance it's in another state? For example, if it's across a river or something, but unlikely.

Perhaps it's in Connecticut or something, but no, Connecticut is south and east.

Latitude 42 is north of Connecticut; Connecticut's northern border is around 42.05°N, but longitude is different.

Connecticut is around -73.5 or so, but latitude up to 42.05, so at latitude 42.6664, it's north of Connecticut.

So, definitely not.

Massachusetts western part is at latitude up to 42.886°N, but longitude around -73.2, as I said.

So, at longitude -73.8, it's in New York.

Therefore, the state is New York.
