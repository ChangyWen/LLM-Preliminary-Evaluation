*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 44.9635 and longitude -93.2678 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are geographical coordinates. Latitude 44.9635 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -93.2678 is in the Western Hemisphere, since it's negative.

I recall that longitude -93 is around the central United States. Let me think about major cities or known locations.

I know that Minneapolis, Minnesota, is around there. I think Minneapolis has coordinates close to 44.9778 N and -93.2650 W. Let me compare:

Given: Latitude 44.9635, Longitude -93.2678

Minneapolis approximate: Latitude 44.9778, Longitude -93.2650

That's very close. The difference is small: latitude difference is about 0.0143 degrees, and longitude difference is about 0.0028 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.0143 degrees is roughly 1.59 km, and for longitude, at latitude 45, 1 degree is about 111 km * cos(45) ≈ 111 * 0.707 ≈ 78.5 km, so 0.0028 degrees is about 0.22 km or 220 meters. So, it's very close to Minneapolis.

Minneapolis is in Minnesota, which is a state in the USA.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this exact point is within Minnesota or perhaps in a neighboring state. The coordinates are very close to Minneapolis, so it's likely in Minnesota.

Let me think about the borders. Minnesota borders Wisconsin to the east, Iowa to the south, South Dakota and North Dakota to the west, and Canada to the north. Longitude -93 is roughly the line between Minnesota and Wisconsin, but Minneapolis is west of that.

Actually, the Mississippi River runs through Minneapolis, and the state border with Wisconsin is along the river in some parts, but Minneapolis is firmly in Minnesota.

I can recall that the city of Minneapolis is located at approximately 44.98 N, -93.26 W, which matches closely.

Moreover, I can think about famous landmarks. For example, the coordinates given might be for a specific place in Minneapolis, like the airport or a university, but regardless, it's in Minnesota.

To double-check, let's consider the latitude and longitude ranges for Minnesota.

Minnesota's latitude range is approximately from 43.5 N to 49.4 N, and longitude from -89.5 W to -97.2 W. Wait, let me recall:

- Westernmost point: around -97.2 W

- Easternmost: around -89.5 W (but that's the border with Wisconsin)

Longitude -93.2678 is between -89.5 and -97.2, so it's within Minnesota's longitude range.

Latitude 44.9635 is between 43.5 and 49.4, so yes.

Now, to ensure it's not in a neighboring state, let's check the borders.

- To the south, Iowa starts around latitude 43.5 N, but Minneapolis is at 45 N, so far north.

- To the east, Wisconsin border is around longitude -92 W or so for parts, but Minneapolis is at -93.26 W, which is west of that.

Actually, the Minnesota-Wisconsin border is along the St. Croix River and then the Mississippi, but in terms of longitude, -93.26 W is well within Minnesota.

I can confidently say it's in Minnesota.

The user asked for the state, and since it's in the US, the answer should be Minnesota.

Finally, the user said to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be explanatory, but end with the answer on a new line.
