*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 36.783 and longitude -119.7939 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate falls into.

Latitude and longitude are given: latitude 36.783, which is north (since it's positive), and longitude -119.7939, which is west (since it's negative). So, this is in the northern hemisphere and western hemisphere.

I know that the United States spans various latitudes and longitudes. Latitude 36.783 is around the same as Los Angeles or Fresno, which is in California. Longitude -119.7939 is also in the western part of the US.

Let me recall some key longitudes:

- The west coast of the US is around -120 to -124 longitude.

- Specifically, California is between about -114 to -124 longitude.

Longitude -119.7939 is west, so it's in the western US.

Now, latitude 36.783: 

- 36 degrees north is roughly the latitude of central California. For example, Fresno, California is around 36.7 latitude.

I think Fresno, California has coordinates approximately 36.783 N, 119.786 W. That sounds very familiar.

Let me confirm: Yes, looking back at my knowledge, the coordinates given are very close to Fresno, California.

Latitude 36.783 and longitude -119.7939. If I recall, Fresno is at about 36.7833 N, 119.786 W or something similar. It's extremely close.

So, this should be in California.

But to be thorough, I should consider if it could be in another state.

Let's think about bordering states:

- To the east of California is Nevada, but Nevada has longitudes around -114 to -120, but latitude 36.783 might be in southern Nevada, but longitude -119.7939 is quite west, so probably still in California.

The California-Nevada border is roughly at longitude -114.5 for the southern part, but actually, it varies. The western border of Nevada is along the Sierra Nevada, which is around -119 to -120 longitude in some parts.

Actually, longitude -119.7939 is west of the California-Nevada border. California extends to about -124 longitude on the coast, and the border with Nevada is irregular, but generally, longitude -119 is still within California for latitudes around 36-37.

For example, Death Valley is in California at around -116 longitude, but that's east. Longitude increases eastward, so -120 is west, -119 is east of that.

Standard: longitude -124 is the Pacific coast, -120 is inland California, -119 is further east but still in California until the Nevada border.

The California-Nevada border at latitude 36-37 is around longitude -119 to -120. Actually, I think the border dips, but generally, longitude -119.7939 at latitude 36.783 is definitely in California.

I can think of nearby cities: Fresno is a major city in California at those coordinates.

To confirm, I can recall that the coordinates are for Fresno, which is in Fresno County, California.

So, the state is California.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be clear, and end with the answer on a new line.

I should not be verbose, as per the instruction, but since this is a reasoning step, I'll keep the response concise.

Final answer: California

But to make sure, is there any chance it's in another state? For example, if it were exactly on the border, but -119.7939 is clearly within California.

Latitude 36.783 is south of the California-Oregon border (which is at 42 N), and north of the Mexico border (32 N), so definitely in the US, and in the west.

No other states have that combination: Arizona is more south and east, Utah is north and east, etc.

So, confident it's California.
