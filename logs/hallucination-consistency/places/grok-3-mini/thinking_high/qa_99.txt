First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 33.2175 and longitude -97.1418 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate falls into.

Latitude and longitude are given: 33.2175° N and -97.1418° W. The negative longitude indicates it's west of the Prime Meridian, which is typical for the Americas.

I know that the US is divided into states, and I can use my knowledge of geography to pinpoint this. Latitude 33° is roughly in the southern US, and longitude -97° is around the central part.

Let me recall some state boundaries:

- Texas is known for having a wide range of longitudes and latitudes. Its southern part is around 26° N, and northern part up to about 36° N. Longitudes from about -94° to -106° W.

- Specifically, latitude 33° N cuts through several states. For example, it goes through California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.

- Longitude -97° W: This is more central. In Texas, Dallas is around 32.7767° N, -96.7970° W. Austin is about 30.2672° N, -97.7431° W.

The given coordinate is 33.2175° N, -97.1418° W.

Let me compare to known cities:

- Dallas, TX is approximately 32.78° N, -96.80° W.

- Fort Worth, TX is close to Dallas, around 32.75° N, -97.33° W.

- The longitude -97.1418° is very close to Fort Worth's longitude.

- Latitude 33.2175° is a bit north of Dallas/Fort Worth area. Dallas is 32.78°, so 33.2175° is about 0.44° north, which is roughly 30 miles north (since 1° latitude is about 69 miles).

- I think there's a city called Denton in Texas, which is north of Dallas. Denton, TX is approximately 33.2148° N, -97.1331° W. That sounds very close!

Let me verify: The given lat/long is 33.2175, -97.1418. Denton's coordinates are often listed as 33.2148° N, -97.1331° W. It's extremely close.

So, Denton, Texas is at that location, and Texas is the state.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this is indeed in Texas and not near a border.

Texas borders Oklahoma to the north. Oklahoma's southern border is at 36.5° N, but the Red River forms part of the boundary, which is irregular.

Latitude 33.2175° N is well south of 36.5°, so it's not in Oklahoma.

To the east, Texas borders Arkansas and Louisiana, but longitudes: Arkansas starts around -94° W, while -97° is west of that.

Longitude -97° W: Texas's eastern border is around -94° to -95°, so -97° is deeper into Texas.

Westward, Texas goes to about -106° W, so no issue.

Also, check for any anomalies, but this seems squarely in north-central Texas.

I could think about the coordinate system. Using a map or mental map, this is in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex area, specifically north of Fort Worth, in Denton County, Texas.

Therefore, the state is Texas.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be concise, and end with the answer.

Final answer: Texas
