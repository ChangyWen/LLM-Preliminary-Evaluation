*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 35.3529 and longitude -119.0359 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate falls into.

Latitude and longitude are given: 35.3529 N and -119.0359 W. The negative longitude indicates it's west of the Prime Meridian, which is typical for the Americas.

I know that the US has several states, and I need to figure out which one contains this point. Latitude 35.3529 is around 35 degrees north, and longitude -119.0359 is about 119 degrees west.

Recalling some key longitudes and latitudes:

- California is on the west coast, with longitudes around -114 to -124 degrees west.

- Latitude-wise, California spans from about 32 to 42 degrees north.

So, latitude 35.3529 is within California's range. Longitude -119.0359 is also within California's western longitudes.

To be more precise, I should think about specific cities or known points.

I recall that Bakersfield, California, is around there. Let me check my knowledge: Bakersfield is in California, and its coordinates are approximately 35.3733 N, -119.0187 W. That's very close to 35.3529 N, -119.0359 W.

Comparing:

- Given: 35.3529 N, -119.0359 W

- Bakersfield: roughly 35.37 N, -119.02 W

Yes, very close. So this is likely in or near Bakersfield, which is in California.

But to be thorough, I should confirm if this could be in another state. Adjacent states:

- To the east of California is Nevada, but Nevada's longitudes are more east, like -114 to -120, but -119 is still within California. The border between California and Nevada is around -114 to -120, but I think California's western border is the Pacific, and eastern border with Nevada is jagged, but longitude -119 is definitely in California.

Longitude -119 is west of the California-Nevada border. The border runs along the 120th meridian in some parts, but California extends to about -124 W on the coast and -114 E-ish, wait no.

Standard knowledge:

- California's longitude range is approximately from 124° W to 114° W.

More accurately:

- Westernmost point: about 124.4° W

- Easternmost point: about 114.13° W (near Arizona border)

Longitude -119.0359 W is between -114 and -124, so yes, within California.

Latitude 35.3529 N: California's southern border is with Mexico at about 32.5° N, and northern border with Oregon at about 42° N, so 35.3529 is well within.

Now, to confirm the state: Could it be in Arizona or another state? Arizona is east of California, with longitudes around -109 to -114 W, so -119 is west of that, so no.

Utah is further east, Nevada is adjacent but as I said, border is around 120° W in some areas, but California includes areas up to that.

Actually, the California-Nevada border is not a straight line of longitude; it's defined by the Colorado River and other features, but generally, longitude -119 W is in California.

Since the coordinates are very close to Bakersfield, which is unambiguously in California, I can be confident.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be clear, and end with the state name on a new line.

Response structure:

- I can briefly explain how I determined it, but since the user didn't ask for reasoning, I could just state it, but as an AI, it's good to be helpful.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." So I should have some response text, then the answer.

Perhaps: "Based on the given latitude and longitude, the location is in California."

Then on a new line: California

To make it neat.
