*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 33.5719 and longitude -117.1909 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are coordinates on Earth. Latitude 33.5719 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -117.1909 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I know that the US has several states in this region. Latitude around 33-34 degrees north is roughly in the southern part of the US, and longitude around -117 degrees west is in the western part.

Let me recall some key cities and their coordinates:

- Los Angeles, California, is around latitude 34.0522 N and longitude -118.2437 W.

- The given latitude is 33.5719 N and longitude -117.1909 W.

Comparing to Los Angeles: latitude is a bit lower (south) at 33.5719 vs 34.0522, and longitude is less negative, meaning east of Los Angeles (-117.1909 vs -118.2437). Less negative longitude means east, since west longitudes are negative.

-117.1909 W is east of -118.2437 W because -117 is greater than -118 in numerical value, but since it's west, a smaller magnitude negative number is east. Longitude increases as you go east, so -117 is east of -118.

Standard longitude: more negative means further west. So -118.2437 W is west of -117.1909 W. If longitude is -118.2437, that's more west than -117.1909, which is less west, so closer to the east.

Numerically, -117.1909 is greater than -118.2437, so it's east of Los Angeles.

Now, latitude 33.5719 N is south of Los Angeles' 34.0522 N.

So, this point is southeast of Los Angeles.

I think this might be in Orange County or San Diego County in California.

I recall that San Diego is around latitude 32.7157 N and longitude -117.1611 W.

Given latitude 33.5719 N is north of San Diego's 32.7157 N, and longitude -117.1909 W is very close to San Diego's -117.1611 W.

San Diego longitude is -117.1611 W, given is -117.1909 W, which is slightly west.

But latitude: San Diego 32.7157 N, given 33.5719 N, which is about 0.8562 degrees north, which is roughly 8562 / 111 â‰ˆ 77 km north, since 1 degree latitude is about 111 km.

More precisely, 1 degree latitude is approximately 111 km, so difference of 33.5719 - 32.7157 = 0.8562 degrees, so about 95 km north of San Diego.

San Diego is at 32.7 N, and Los Angeles is at 34.05 N, so 33.57 N is between them.

Perhaps it's in the area of Anaheim or something in Orange County.

I think Disneyland is in Anaheim, California. Let me recall Anaheim's coordinates.

Anaheim is around latitude 33.8366 N and longitude -117.9145 W. That longitude seems off.

-117.9145 W for Anaheim? I think Anaheim is east of Los Angeles, so longitude should be less negative.

Los Angeles is -118.24 W, Anaheim might be around -117.9 W or something.

Upon second thought, I should think of known points.

I know that the border between California and Arizona is along the Colorado River, and longitudes around there.

Longitude -117 W is definitely in California, as California's western border is around -124 W, and eastern border with Arizona is around -114 W to -114.5 W or something.

California's southern border with Mexico is at about 32.5 N, and northern part up to 42 N.

Longitude: westernmost is about -124.4 W, easternmost with Arizona is the Colorado River, which at the border is around -114.5 W.

-117 W is well within California.

For example, San Bernardino is around there.

Perhaps I can think of Irvine or something.

I recall that latitude 33.5719 N and longitude -117.1909 W sounds familiar; I think this might be Mission Viejo or some place in Orange County, California.

To be precise, I should confirm the state.

Since the longitude is -117.1909 W, which is between -120 and -114, it's in the western US.

Possible states: California, Nevada, Arizona, but Nevada is more north and east.

Nevada's western border is around -120 W, but latitudes: Nevada starts around 35 N or so in the south.

Las Vegas is at 36.1699 N, -115.1398 W.

Given latitude 33.5719 N is south of that, so not Nevada.

Arizona: Phoenix is at 33.4484 N, -112.0740 W.

Given longitude -117.1909 W is west of Phoenix's -112.0740 W.

-117 vs -112, -117 is more negative, so further west.

Arizona's western border is at about -114.8 W or so, along the Colorado River.

Longitude -114.8 W is the border, so -117.1909 W is west of that, so in California.

Yes, definitely in California.

To confirm, the coordinate 33.5719 N, -117.1909 W is likely in Orange County, California.

For example, I think Laguna Niguel or Mission Viejo area.

But I don't need the exact city, just the state.

So, the state is California.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, I should write a response explaining briefly, and then state the answer.

The question is straightforward, so I can be concise.

Final answer should be: California

But to make sure, is there any chance it's in another state? For example, if it were exactly on the border, but -117.1909 W is clearly within California.

Latitude 33.5719 N is above Mexico, since the US-Mexico border in California is around 32.5 N.

So, yes.
