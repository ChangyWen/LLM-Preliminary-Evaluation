*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 47.6211 and longitude -122.3244 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 47.6211 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -122.3244 is in the Western Hemisphere, since it's negative.

I recall that longitude -122 is around the west coast of the United States. Specifically, I think this might be in Washington state. Let me think about major cities.

I know that Seattle, Washington, has coordinates around 47.6062 latitude and -122.3321 longitude. Let me compare:

- Given latitude: 47.6211

- Seattle's latitude: approximately 47.6062

- Difference is small, about 0.0149 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, this is roughly 1.65 km difference.

- Given longitude: -122.3244

- Seattle's longitude: approximately -122.3321

- Difference is about 0.0077 degrees. 1 degree of longitude at this latitude is about 111 km * cos(47.6°) ≈ 111 * 0.675 ≈ 75 km, so difference is roughly 0.58 km.

So, the given coordinates are very close to Seattle, Washington. Probably within the city or nearby.

Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest, and its coordinates range roughly from latitude 45.5 to 49, and longitude -116.9 to -124.8. So, -122.3244 is within that range.

To confirm, I should check if this could be in another state. For example, Oregon is south of Washington, with latitudes starting around 42, so 47.6 is too north for Oregon. Idaho is east, with longitudes around -114 to -117, so -122 is too west. British Columbia in Canada is north, but the longitude might overlap, but latitude 47.6 is south of the US-Canada border, which is at 49 degrees north. Washington state's northern border is at 49 degrees, so latitude 47.6 is well within Washington.

The US-Canada border along the 49th parallel is the boundary, and 47.6211 is less than 49, so it's south of the border, in the US.

Now, within the US, the states around there: Washington to the west, but longitude -122 is coastal, so it's Washington. No other states have this combination.

I can think about the city: Seattle is in King County, Washington. The coordinates given are very close to Seattle's center.

Perhaps I can recall that the Space Needle or other landmarks in Seattle have similar coordinates.

So, the state is Washington.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

My response should be helpful and clear. I can briefly explain how I arrived at the answer, but since it's a straightforward question, I don't need to go into too much detail.

Final answer should be just the state name.

State name is Washington.

Is there any chance it's in a different state? For example, if it's on the border, but 47.6211 and -122.3244 is clearly in Washington. No ambiguity.

Alright, so I'll structure my response.
