*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 42.9018 and longitude -78.8487 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 42.9018 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -78.8487 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different latitude and longitude ranges. Longitude -78.8487 is quite west, and latitude around 42.9 is in the northern part of the US.

Let me think about states around that area. New York State has cities like Buffalo, which I believe is near that latitude and longitude.

I know that Buffalo, New York, is close to the US-Canada border and near Niagara Falls. Let me recall Buffalo's coordinates. I think Buffalo is approximately at latitude 42.8864 and longitude -78.8784. That's very close to 42.9018 and -78.8487.

Calculating the difference: Latitude difference is 42.9018 - 42.8864 = 0.0154 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.0154 degrees is roughly 1.71 km. Longitude difference: -78.8487 - (-78.8784) = 0.0297 degrees. At latitude 42.9, 1 degree longitude is about 85 km (since it decreases from the equator), so 0.0297 degrees is about 2.52 km. So, the point is very close to Buffalo, probably within the city or nearby.

Buffalo is in New York State. So, the state should be New York.

To be thorough, I should confirm if this exact point is indeed in New York. Given the coordinates are so close, and considering the US-Canada border, latitude 42.9 is south of the border, so it should be in the US.

Other states nearby: Pennsylvania is south, with latitudes around 40-42, but longitude -78 is more east. Western New York is around longitude -78 to -79. Ohio is further west, around -82 to -83 longitude. So, -78.8487 is definitely in the eastern part.

Vermont or other New England states have longitudes around -72 to -73, which is east of -78. So, no, it's not there.

Therefore, the location is in New York State.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

My response should be helpful and clear. I can briefly explain how I arrived at the answer, but since the user didn't ask for reasoning, I can keep it concise. However, as an AI, providing a bit of context might be good.

Final answer should be just the state name on a new line.

So, the state is New York.
