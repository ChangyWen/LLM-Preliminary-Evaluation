*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 47.6671 and longitude -117.433 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 47.6671 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -117.433 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western part of the world.

I know that the United States has several states in this region. Longitude -117 is around the western US. Latitude 47 is quite north, so it could be in states like Washington, Idaho, or Montana.

Let me recall the approximate coordinates:

- Washington state is roughly between 45° to 49° N latitude and 116° to 124° W longitude.

- Idaho is between about 42° to 49° N and 111° to 117° W.

- Longitude -117.433 is west, so it might be on the border.

I think Spokane is a city in Washington state. I recall that Spokane's coordinates are approximately 47.66° N and 117.42° W. That sounds very close to 47.6671 N and -117.433 W.

Let me confirm: Yes, Spokane, Washington is at about 47.6588° N, 117.4260° W. The given coordinates are 47.6671 N and -117.433, which is very close. Probably within the city or nearby area.

So, if it's Spokane, it's in Washington state.

But to be thorough, I should check if this could be in another state. The border between Washington and Idaho is along the 117th meridian in some parts. Actually, the border between Washington and Idaho is at 117° W longitude for a portion.

Idaho's panhandle extends west, and the border with Washington is indeed at 117° W from about 46° to 49° N. So, longitude -117.433 is west of 117° W, which might still be in Washington or very close.

Longitude -117.433 means 117.433° W, so it's slightly west of 117° W. Since the border is at exactly 117° W, anything west of that should be in Washington, and east would be Idaho.

In the US, longitudes increase westward, so -117.433 is 117.433° W. The border between Washington and Idaho is at 117° W, so:

- East of 117° W is Idaho.

- West of 117° W is Washington.

Longitude -117.433 is more negative, so it's further west. Since longitude decreases as you go west (more negative), -117.433 is west of -117.000.

Standard notation: Longitude is given as negative for west, so -117.000 is 117° W. A more negative number, like -117.433, is still 117.433° W, which is west of 117.000° W.

If the border is at 117° W exactly, then:

- Longitude exactly -117.000 is on the border.

- Longitude less than -117.000 (more negative) is west, so in Washington.

- Longitude greater than -117.000 (less negative, e.g., -116.999) is east, so in Idaho.

Longitude increases eastward and westward from the Prime Meridian, but in numerical value with sign, negative west longitudes: as you go west, longitude becomes more negative.

So, for example:

- -116.000 W is east of -117.000 W.

- -117.000 W is west of -116.000 W.

If the border is at 117° W (-117.000), then:

- Longitudes with |lon| < 117 (e.g., -116.999) are east of the border.

- Longitudes with |lon| > 117 (e.g., -117.001) are west of the border.

Since it's negative, a smaller magnitude means east, larger magnitude means west.

Numerically, -116.999 > -117.000, so higher number is east.

Given longitude -117.433, which is less than -117.000 (since -117.433 < -117.000), so it's west of -117.000.

Therefore, since the border is at -117.000, a longitude of -117.433 is west of that, so it should be in Washington state.

Moreover, latitude 47.6671 is around 47.67 N, which is within the range where the border is straight along 117° W.

Spokane is indeed in Washington, and its longitude is about -117.426, which matches closely with -117.433.

So, the place is likely in Washington state.

To be precise, I can think about using a map or known coordinates. Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll assume based on memory.

Final answer should be Washington.
