*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.8501 and longitude -73.8662 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

I know that latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 40.8501 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -73.8662 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that New York City has coordinates around 40.7128 latitude and -74.0060 longitude. This given latitude is 40.8501, which is a bit higher (more north) than NYC's 40.7128, and longitude -73.8662 is less negative, meaning it's east of NYC's -74.0060.

Longitude -73.8662 is west, but less west than -74.0060, so it's actually east of NYC because -73.8662 is greater than -74.0060 (since -73.8662 is closer to zero).

Confirming: NYC is approximately at (-74.0060, 40.7128). So latitude 40.8501 is north of that, and longitude -73.8662 is east of -74.0060.

I think this might be in the Bronx or somewhere in New York state. Let me think about nearby areas.

I can recall that the Bronx is part of New York City, and its coordinates might match. Let me estimate.

I know that the boundary between states: New York state borders several states, but with latitude around 40.85 and longitude around -73.87, it's likely in the northeastern US.

Possible states: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, etc.

Longitude -73.8662: The 74th meridian west passes through New York City, and -73 is further east. Actually, -73 longitude is east of -74.

Standard US longitudes: New York City is around -74, Philadelphia is around -75, Boston is around -71.

Longitude -73.8662: Since NYC is -74.0060, -73.8662 is about 0.14 degrees east. Each degree of longitude is about 69 miles at the equator, but less at higher latitudes. At 40 degrees latitude, it's roughly 69 * cos(40) ≈ 69 * 0.766 ≈ 53 miles per degree.

So 0.14 degrees is about 0.14 * 53 ≈ 7.4 miles. So about 7-8 miles east of NYC center.

NYC center is Manhattan, so east would be towards Queens or Brooklyn, but latitude is higher: 40.8501 vs NYC's 40.7128. Difference in latitude: 40.8501 - 40.7128 = 0.1373 degrees. Latitude degrees are about 69 miles per degree, so 0.1373 * 69 ≈ 9.47 miles north.

So approximately 9.5 miles north and 7.5 miles east of NYC center.

NYC center is around Manhattan. North and east: north would be towards Harlem or uptown, but east is towards the East River.

Actually, 9.5 miles north from mid-Manhattan might be around the Bronx or Westchester County.

I think the coordinate 40.8501, -73.8662 sounds familiar. I believe this is close to Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx.

I can confirm that the Bronx has coordinates in that range. For example, I think Yankee Stadium is around there.

Upon thinking, I recall that latitude 40.8296, longitude -73.9262 is Yankee Stadium, which is close but not exact. Given is 40.8501, -73.8662.

40.8501 is a bit higher latitude, so further north.

Perhaps it's in Yonkers or something, but Yonkers is in Westchester County, still New York state.

Maybe I can use a mental map or known points.

I know that the Hudson River is around longitude -74 to -73.9 or so in NYC area.

Perhaps I can think about the state boundaries.

New York state extends north and east. The border with Connecticut is around longitude -73.7 or so in some parts.

Actually, the New York-Connecticut border is irregular, but around latitude 41, longitude -73.5 to -73.7 or something.

But latitude 40.85 is south of that.

Latitude 40.85 is around the level of NYC and up to White Plains or something.

White Plains, NY is at about 41.0339 latitude, -73.7629 longitude. So latitude 41.03 is higher than 40.85, so south of White Plains.

Longitude -73.8662 is west of -73.7629, so a bit west.

Perhaps it's in the Bronx or Westchester.

But Westchester County is part of New York state.

Now, is this coordinate in New York City or outside?

New York City boroughs: Bronx is the northernmost.

I think the coordinate 40.8501, -73.8662 might be in the Bronx.

Perhaps I can calculate the distance.

I recall that Fordham University in the Bronx is at approximately 40.8613, -73.8857, which is close: latitude 40.8613 vs 40.8501 (about 0.0112 degrees difference, which is 0.0112 * 69 ≈ 0.77 miles), and longitude -73.8857 vs -73.8662 (difference 0.0195 degrees, at lat 40, 0.0195 * 53 ≈ 1.03 miles). So very close, about 1 mile apart or so.

Fordham University is in the Bronx, New York City, which is in New York state.

To be precise, I should confirm if it's exactly in the state.

Given that it's very close to known Bronx locations, it's almost certainly in New York state.

Now, could it be in another state? For example, New Jersey is west and south, but longitude -73.8662 is east of NYC, so not in New Jersey. New Jersey is around longitude -74 to -75.

Connecticut is east, but latitude 40.85 is too south; Connecticut starts around latitude 41 north.

The southernmost point of Connecticut is around 41 degrees north, I think. Actually, the border with New York is at about 41 degrees in some parts, but there are areas like Greenwich, CT, which might be close.

Greenwich, CT is at approximately 41.026, -73.628, which is latitude 41.026 (higher than 40.85) and longitude -73.628 (east of -73.8662).

So 40.85 latitude is south of Connecticut's border. The New York-Connecticut border dips down in some areas, but I think the lowest latitude for Connecticut is around 40.95 or something? No, I think the border is generally above 41 degrees.

Upon second thought, the Bronx is surrounded by water and New York state land, but it's part of NYC.

The coordinate is likely within the Bronx, which is in New York state.

To be thorough, I can consider that any location with latitude around 40.85 and longitude -73.87 is firmly within New York state, not bordering any other state closely.

The nearest state border might be with New Jersey across the Hudson, but that's at longitude around -74 or west.

East is Long Island Sound, but that's water, and beyond is Connecticut, but as said, further north.

So, definitely in New York state.

Therefore, the state is New York.

The user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, I should respond with some reasoning, but since the instruction is to think step by step, I'll do that in my mind, and then provide the answer.

In the response, I need to be helpful and concise.

Final answer should be "New York"

But to make sure, perhaps I can box it or just state it.

The user said: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I'll write a brief response and then the answer.
