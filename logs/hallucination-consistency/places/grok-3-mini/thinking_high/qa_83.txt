*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 40.2457 and longitude -111.6457 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate falls into.

Latitude and longitude are given: 40.2457 N and -111.6457 W. The negative longitude indicates it's west of the Prime Meridian, which is typical for the Americas.

I know that the US is divided into states, and I can use my knowledge of geography to pinpoint this. Latitude 40.2457 is around 40 degrees north, which could be in several states like New York, Pennsylvania, or further west.

Longitude -111.6457 is about 111 degrees west. I recall that the Rocky Mountains are around there. Let me think about the longitudes of US states.

- The East Coast is around -70 to -80 longitude.

- Moving west, the Midwest is around -90 to -100.

- The Rocky Mountain states are around -100 to -115.

Specifically, -111 longitude should be in the western US. Let me recall:

- Colorado is around -105 to -109.

- Utah is around -109 to -114.

I think Utah's longitude range is approximately from -109° W to -114° W. Let me confirm that.

Actually, upon thinking, Salt Lake City is in Utah, and I believe its coordinates are around 40.76 N, -111.89 W. That sounds familiar.

Let me compare the given coordinates: latitude 40.2457, longitude -111.6457.

Salt Lake City's approximate coordinates are 40.7608 N, -111.8910 W. So, the given latitude is a bit south of Salt Lake City, and longitude is a bit east (since -111.6457 is less negative than -111.8910, meaning east of Salt Lake City).

Longitude -111.6457 vs -111.8910: since -111.6457 is greater than -111.8910 (in numerical value, but in geography, less negative means east), so yes, east of Salt Lake City.

But still within Utah? Utah's western border is around -114°, and eastern border around -109°. Let me recall:

- Utah's longitude: west border with Nevada is approximately -114°, east border with Colorado is -109°.

More precisely, Utah spans from about 109° W to 114° W longitude.

-109° W is the eastern border, and -114° W is the western border.

The given longitude is -111.6457 W, which is between -109 and -114, so definitely within Utah's longitude range.

Now, latitude: Utah's latitude range is from about 37° N to 42° N. Southern border with Arizona is around 37°, northern border with Idaho and Wyoming is around 42°.

Given latitude 40.2457 N is between 37 and 42, so within Utah's latitude range.

But to be precise, I should check if this specific point is in Utah or perhaps in a neighboring state.

Neighboring states:

- To the east is Colorado, which has longitude starting from -102° W to -109° W. Colorado's western border is approximately -109° W, same as Utah's eastern border.

Utah's eastern border is along 109° W with Colorado, but it's a bit irregular. Generally, -109° W is the border.

Given longitude -111.6457 W is west of -109° W, since -111.6457 is more negative, so it's west of the Utah-Colorado border, thus in Utah or further west.

Longitude decreases as you go west, so -111.6457 is west of -109.

Standard longitude: increasing negative values mean further west.

-109° W is east of -111° W.

Numerically, -109 is greater than -111, but in geography, -111° W is west of -109° W.

Yes: -109° W is closer to the east, -111° W is further west.

Utah's eastern border is at approximately 109° W, so longitudes west of 109° W (i.e., more negative) are in Utah until the western border.

Utah's longitude range: from about 109°03' W to 114°03' W or something like that. Roughly 109° to 114° W.

So -111.6457 W is between -109 and -114, yes.

Now, latitude 40.2457 N.

Utah's northern border is with Wyoming and Idaho. The border with Wyoming is at about 41° N or so, but it zigzags.

Specifically, around longitude -111°, what is the state?

I can think of Provo, Utah. I believe Provo is near there.

Upon recollection, Provo, Utah has coordinates approximately 40.2338 N, -111.6585 W.

That sounds very close to the given 40.2457 N, -111.6457 W.

Let me compare:

Given: 40.2457 N, -111.6457 W

Provo: approximately 40.2338 N, -111.6585 W

Very close! Difference in latitude: 40.2457 - 40.2338 = 0.0119 degrees, which is about 1.3 km (since 1 degree latitude is about 111 km).

Longitude difference: -111.6457 - (-111.6585) = 0.0128 degrees, which is about 1.1 km west-east (longitude degrees vary, but at 40° N, 1 degree is about 85 km, so 0.0128 * 85 ≈ 1.1 km).

Actually, calculation: latitude difference is small, longitude difference is small.

More accurately: 40.2457 vs 40.2338 is a difference of 0.0119 degrees latitude.

1 degree latitude = 111 km, so 0.0119 * 111 ≈ 1.32 km.

Longitude: at 40° N, 1 degree longitude = cos(40°) * 111 km ≈ 0.766 * 111 ≈ 85 km.

Difference in longitude: |-111.6457 - (-111.6585)| = | -111.6457 + 111.6585 | = |0.0128| degrees.

So 0.0128 * 85 ≈ 1.09 km.

So the point is about 1.32 km north and 1.09 km east of Provo's center, roughly.

Provo is in Utah County, Utah.

Therefore, this coordinate is very likely in Utah.

To be thorough, I should confirm if it's exactly in Utah or perhaps on a border.

Given the closeness to Provo and the longitude/latitude ranges, it's safely within Utah.

Neighboring states: to the north is Wyoming, but Wyoming's southern border is around 41° N in some parts, but at longitude -111°, the border between Utah and Wyoming is further north.

Utah-Wyoming border: Wyoming's border goes down to about 41° N, but Utah extends up to that.

At longitude -111°, the state line between Utah and Wyoming is at approximately 41° N or so, but I need to recall.

Actually, the Utah-Wyoming border is along the 41st parallel north for part of it, but there might be adjustments.

41° N is the border in some sections, but Utah goes up to 42° N in the northwest.

But latitude 40.2457 is south of 41°, so definitely not in Wyoming.

To the south is Arizona, but Arizona is further south, starting around 37° N.

Utah's southern border with Arizona is at 37° N.

40.2457 is well north of that.

To the east is Colorado, border at 109° W, and -111.6457 is west of that.

To the west is Nevada, border at approximately 114° W.

-111.6457 is east of -114°, so not in Nevada.

Therefore, definitively in Utah.

So, the state is Utah.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, I should structure my response accordingly.
