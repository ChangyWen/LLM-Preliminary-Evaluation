*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where a place with latitude 29.786 and longitude -95.3885 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 29.786 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -95.3885 is in the western hemisphere, since it's negative.

I recall that the United States has various states with different coordinates. Longitude around -95 is in the central part of the US. For example, Texas has longitudes around that range.

Let me think about major cities. Latitude 29.786 sounds familiar. I think Houston, Texas, is around there. I believe Houston's coordinates are approximately 29.76°N, 95.37°W. Let me confirm that.

Upon thinking, 29.786 latitude and -95.3885 longitude – yes, that closely matches Houston, Texas. Longitude is given as -95.3885, which is west, so it's 95.3885°W.

To be precise, I should verify if this is indeed in Texas. Texas spans from about 25°N to 36°N latitude and from about 94°W to 104°W longitude. So, 29.786°N and 95.3885°W falls within Texas.

But is it exactly in Texas? Let me make sure there are no border issues. Houston is a major city in Texas, and these coordinates are very close to Houston's city center.

I can think about nearby states. To the east is Louisiana, but Louisiana has longitudes around -90 to -94. West is New Mexico, which is more like -104 to -109. North is Oklahoma, around -94 to -103, but latitude might be higher. South is the Gulf of Mexico.

Latitude 29.786 is quite south, so in the US, that would be in the southern states. Specifically, along the longitude -95.3885, it should be in Texas.

I can recall that the city of Houston is at approximately 29.7604°N, 95.3698°W. The given coordinates are 29.786 and -95.3885. Let me calculate the difference.

Difference in latitude: 29.786 - 29.7604 ≈ 0.0256 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.0256 * 111 ≈ 2.84 km, so very close.

Longitude difference: -95.3885 - (-95.3698) = -95.3885 + 95.3698 = -0.0187 degrees. 1 degree longitude at this latitude is about 111 km * cos(29.786°) ≈ 111 * 0.865 ≈ 96 km, so 0.0187 * 96 ≈ 1.8 km. So, it's within a few kilometers of Houston.

Therefore, this location is in Houston, Texas, which is in the state of Texas.

The user asked for the state, not the city. So, the state is Texas.

To be thorough, I should confirm that this point is not on a border or in another state. Given the coordinates, it's clearly within Texas boundaries.

Finally, the user said to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be: I need to reason step by step, then end with the answer.

Response structure: Start with explaining or confirming, then state the answer.
