*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 36.1715 and longitude -86.7842 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 36.1715 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -86.7842 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different latitude and longitude ranges. I need to figure out which state this falls into.

Let me think about the longitude: -86.7842. Negative longitude means west, so around 86 degrees west. I know that the Mississippi River is around there, and states like Tennessee, Kentucky, and others are in that area.

Latitude 36.1715 is about 36 degrees north. The 36th parallel is a significant line; it's the boundary between some states. For example, it's the border between Tennessee and Kentucky in parts.

I think the 36th parallel is the northern border of Tennessee in some areas. Tennessee's northern border is indeed along the 36th parallel in the west, but it might vary.

Let me recall the approximate coordinates for major cities. Nashville, Tennessee, is around there. I think Nashville has coordinates close to 36.1627 N and -86.7816 W. That sounds very familiar.

Comparing: Given latitude 36.1715 and longitude -86.7842.

Nashville's latitude is approximately 36.1627, and longitude -86.7816. That's very close to 36.1715 and -86.7842. The difference is small, so this is likely in or near Nashville.

Nashville is in Tennessee. So, probably, this point is in Tennessee.

But I should confirm if it's exactly in Tennessee or possibly in a neighboring state.

Let me think about the borders:

- To the north of Tennessee is Kentucky, but the border is along the 36.5 parallel or something? No, the northern border of Tennessee is generally the 36th parallel, but it might have variations.

Actually, the 36th parallel north is the boundary between Tennessee and Kentucky in the western part, but in the east, it's different due to the Appalachian mountains and state lines.

Given that the longitude is around -86.78, which is central Tennessee, it should be within Tennessee.

I can think about other states:

- Arkansas is west, around -92 to -94 longitude.

- Missouri is further north and west.

- Alabama is south, latitude around 33-35.

- Latitude 36 is too north for Alabama; Alabama's northern border is around 35 degrees.

- Kentucky's southern border is the 36.5 parallel or something? No, Kentucky's southern border with Tennessee is along the 36th parallel in parts.

Upon second thought, the 36th parallel is precisely the border in western Tennessee with Kentucky.

But let's check the exact coordinates.

Since the coordinates are very close to Nashville, and Nashville is definitively in Tennessee, it's safe to say it's in Tennessee.

To be thorough, I can consider if it's in a different state. For example, is there any part where the border might be crossed?

Longitude -86.7842 is west, and latitude 36.1715 is north.

Nashville is at about 36.17 N, -86.78 W, so yes.

I can recall that the state of Tennessee spans from about 35 to 36.7 degrees north latitude, and longitudes from about -81.5 to -90.3 west.

- Eastern Tennessee is around -83 to -82, central around -86, western around -90.

Longitude -86.7842 is within Tennessee's range.

Latitude 36.1715 is also within Tennessee.

Neighboring states:

- North: Kentucky, which starts at latitude around 36.5 north in some parts, but the border with Tennessee is at 36.5? No.

The Tennessee-Kentucky border is along the parallel 36°30' north in the west, which is 36.5 degrees.

36.5 degrees is 36 degrees 30 minutes.

The given latitude is 36.1715 degrees. 36.1715 is less than 36.5, so it should be south of 36.5.

36.1715 is approximately 36 degrees 10.29 minutes (since 0.1715 * 60 ≈ 10.29 minutes).

The 36th parallel is 36.0000, and 36.5 is 36.5000.

So 36.1715 is between 36 and 36.5, so it should be within Tennessee, as Tennessee extends up to 36.5 in some parts.

Tennessee's northern border with Kentucky is at 36°30' north (36.5 degrees) in the oblique section, but in the west, it's straight along 36.5.

Upon thinking, the border between Tennessee and Kentucky is not exactly at 36 degrees; it's at 36°30' north for much of it.

I think the compromise of 1802 set the border at 36°30' north, but there might be variations.

Nashville is at 36.1627 N, which is south of 36.5, so definitely in Tennessee.

The given latitude is 36.1715, which is very close, so still south of 36.5.

36.1715 is less than 36.5, so yes.

Longitude-wise, no issues.

Perhaps this is exactly a point in Nashville or nearby.

I think it's safe to conclude it's in Tennessee.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should end with the state name on a new line.
