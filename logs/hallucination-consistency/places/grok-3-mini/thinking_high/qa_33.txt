*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 41.4764 and longitude -81.6805 is located. I need to identify the location based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 41.4764 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -81.6805 is in the Western Hemisphere, since it's negative.

I recall that the United States has various states with different latitude and longitude ranges. I need to figure out which state this falls into.

Let me think about the approximate locations:

- Latitude around 41 is roughly in the northern part of the US, like New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, etc.

- Longitude around -81 is in the eastern part of the US. For example, New York City is around -74, so -81 is further west.

I know that:

- Ohio has longitudes around -80 to -84 and latitudes around 38 to 42.

Let me verify that. Cleveland, Ohio, is a city I think is around there. I believe Cleveland is at approximately 41.5 latitude and -81.7 longitude. That sounds familiar.

Let me confirm my memory: Yes, Cleveland, Ohio, is often cited with coordinates close to 41.4764 N, -81.6805 W. That matches almost exactly.

So, latitude 41.4764 and longitude -81.6805 should be in Cleveland, which is in Ohio.

But to be thorough, I should consider if this could be in another state. Nearby states:

- Pennsylvania is to the east, with longitudes around -74 to -80, so -81 is west of that.

- West Virginia and Kentucky are south, with lower latitudes.

- Michigan is north, but its southern part might have similar latitude, but longitude is more west, around -82 to -90.

Michigan's longitude starts around -82 for the eastern part, but latitude for lower Michigan is around 42-45, so 41.5 might be a bit south.

Actually, the border between Ohio and Pennsylvania is around longitude -80.5, and Ohio extends to about -84.8. So -81.68 is well within Ohio.

Latitude 41.4764 is within Ohio's range, as Ohio goes up to about 41.97 N at the northern border with Michigan.

Moreover, the coordinates given are very close to Cleveland's known coordinates. I can recall that Cleveland is in Cuyahoga County, Ohio.

To double-check, I can think about the Great Lakes. Latitude 41.5 is south of Lake Erie, and Cleveland is on the shore of Lake Erie in Ohio.

So, it's definitely in Ohio.

The user asked for the state, and to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

My response should be helpful and direct. I don't need to show my reasoning in the response, just provide the answer as instructed.

Finally, end with the answer on a new line.
