*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 41.2627 and longitude -96.0529 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate falls into.

I know that latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 41.2627 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -96.0529 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States spans various latitudes and longitudes. For example, the eastern US has longitudes around -70 to -80, and the western US goes to -125 or so. Longitude -96 is roughly in the central part of the US.

Let me think about the states around longitude -96. I know that the Mississippi River is around there, and states like Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, etc., are in that region.

Latitude 41.2627 is about 41 degrees north. That's similar to the latitude of places like New York City (around 40.7) or Chicago (around 41.8), so it's in the northern part of the central US.

Now, let's narrow it down. Longitude -96 is close to the border between states. I think Omaha, Nebraska, is around there. I recall Omaha's coordinates are approximately 41.2565 latitude and -95.995 longitude or something very close.

Comparing: given latitude 41.2627 and longitude -96.0529. That's very close to 41.2565 and -95.995. Probably the same area.

Omaha is in Nebraska. So, this coordinate is likely in Nebraska.

But to be precise, I should confirm the state boundaries. Nebraska's eastern border is along the Missouri River, which is around longitude -96. I think the coordinate given is just west of the river, so still in Nebraska.

Longitude -96.0529 is west, and since the Missouri River might be around -96, but I need to be accurate.

I can think about the state boundaries:

- Nebraska's southern border is with Kansas, around latitude 40.

- Northern border with South Dakota, around 43.

- Latitude 41.2627 is within Nebraska's range.

For longitude, Nebraska spans from about -95.5 to -104. Western border with Wyoming and Colorado.

Longitude -96 is on the eastern side. The eastern border of Nebraska is the Missouri River, which separates it from Iowa and Missouri.

I think the coordinate -96.0529 longitude and 41.2627 latitude should be in Nebraska.

To double-check, I can think about nearby cities. Omaha is a major city there, and its coordinates are very close: Omaha is at approximately 41.2524° N, 95.9980° W. The given is 41.2627 N, -96.0529 W, which is slightly different but still in the same area.

-96.0529 is more west than -95.9980. Longitude west is negative, so -96.0529 is further west than -95.9980.

Standard longitude: more negative means further west.

Omaha is at about -95.998, which is approximately 96° W, but let's calculate.

-95.998 is about 96° W, yes. -96.0529 is slightly more west, so maybe still in Nebraska or close to the border.

Nebraska's eastern border is the Missouri River. The Missouri River runs roughly along longitude -96 in that area.

Upon second thought, Omaha is on the west bank of the Missouri River, so it's in Nebraska. The river is the border, so east of the river is Iowa.

I need to know if longitude -96.0529 is east or west of the river.

Typically, the Missouri River in the Omaha area is around longitude -96.00 or so. I think Omaha's longitude is about -95.99, which is very close.

Perhaps I should assume that -96.0529 is still west of the river or on it.

I can recall that the coordinate given is very close to Eppley Airfield in Omaha, which is in Nebraska.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll go with my knowledge.

Another way: I can think about the state abbreviations or common knowledge.

Latitude 41.2627, longitude -96.0529.

I know that Council Bluffs, Iowa, is just across the river from Omaha, so it might be close.

But looking at the numbers: Omaha is at 41.2565, -95.9953 approximately.

Given is 41.2627, -96.0529.

Difference in latitude: 41.2627 - 41.2565 = 0.0062 degrees. Since 1 degree latitude is about 111 km, 0.0062 * 111 ≈ 0.688 km, or about 688 meters north.

Difference in longitude: -96.0529 - (-95.9953) = -96.0529 + 95.9953 = -0.0576 degrees.

Longitude degrees vary with latitude, but roughly 1 degree longitude is about 111 km * cos(latitude). Latitude around 41, cos(41) ≈ 0.7547, so 1 degree longitude ≈ 111 * 0.7547 ≈ 83.77 km.

So 0.0576 degrees ≈ 0.0576 * 83.77 ≈ 4.82 km west.

So the given point is about 688 meters north and 4.82 km west of Omaha's center.

Omaha is in Nebraska, and moving west from Omaha should still be in Nebraska, as the city extends west.

The Missouri River is the eastern border, so as long as it's west of the river, it's Nebraska.

I think the river is around longitude -96.00, and -96.0529 is slightly west, so definitely in Nebraska.

To be thorough, I can consider if it's in any other state. North would be Iowa or South Dakota, but latitude 41.26 is below Iowa's southern border, which is around 40.5 or something? No, Iowa's southern border is with Missouri at about 40.5, but northern part is higher.

Iowa's latitudes: from about 40.5 to 43.5 N.

Longitude for Iowa is from -90 to -96.5 or so.

Eastern Iowa is at -90, western at -96.5.

So longitude -96.0529 could be in Iowa or Nebraska.

The border is the Missouri River.

At latitude 41.26, the Missouri River is the boundary.

I need to know on which side of the river this longitude is.

From memory, the Missouri River in that area has Omaha on the west bank (Nebraska) and Council Bluffs on the east bank (Iowa).

The longitude of the river: I think it's approximately -95.9 to -96.1 or something.

Assuming that longitude -96.05 is west of the river.

Since the given coordinate is very close to Omaha's known coordinates, and Omaha is in Nebraska, it's safe to say it's in Nebraska.

Moreover, if I think about it, the exact coordinate might be for a specific place in Omaha or nearby.

So, I believe the state is Nebraska.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, my response should be concise, and end with the answer.

I should not ramble in the response, but since this is my reasoning, I'll keep it internal.

Final answer: Nebraska.
