*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 41.2279 and longitude -111.9682 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate falls into.

Latitude and longitude are given: 41.2279 N and -111.9682 W. The negative longitude indicates it's west of the Prime Meridian, which is typical for the Americas.

I recall that the US is divided into states, and coordinates can help pinpoint which state it's in. I should think about the geography of the US.

Latitude 41.2279 is around 41 degrees north. That's in the northern part of the US. For reference, New York City is about 40.7 N, so this is a bit north of that. Longitude -111.9682 is about 112 degrees west.

Longitude -112 W is roughly the area around Utah. I know that Utah's longitude ranges from about -109 to -114 W. Let me confirm that.

Utah is known for its position in the Rocky Mountains. Salt Lake City, for example, has coordinates around 40.76 N and -111.89 W. Let me check that.

Salt Lake City's latitude is approximately 40.76 N and longitude -111.89 W. The given coordinates are 41.2279 N and -111.9682 W.

Comparing:

- Latitude: 41.2279 vs. Salt Lake City's 40.76 – that's a bit north.

- Longitude: -111.9682 vs. -111.89 – very close, but slightly west.

Salt Lake City is at -111.89, and this is -111.9682, which is more negative, so further west.

Now, is this still in Utah? Utah's western border is with Nevada, and I think Nevada starts around -114 W or so. Let me think about state borders.

Utah's longitude range: The eastern border is with Colorado at about -109 W, and western border with Nevada. Nevada's eastern border is around -114 W to -115 W. I need better recall.

I can think about cities or known points. Ogden, Utah, is north of Salt Lake City. Ogden's coordinates are approximately 41.22 N and -111.97 W. That sounds very familiar.

Let me verify: Yes, Ogden, Utah, is located at about 41.223 N, 111.973 W. The given coordinates are 41.2279 N and -111.9682 W, which is extremely close to Ogden.

So, Ogden is in Utah, Weber County, to be precise.

To confirm, let's ensure no other states are nearby. North of Utah is Idaho, which starts around latitude 42 N or so, but Utah's northern border is with Idaho and Wyoming.

Utah's northern border: With Idaho to the north and Wyoming to the northeast. The latitude 41.2279 is within Utah's range. Utah's latitude goes from about 37 N to 42 N.

Southern Utah is around 37 N (e.g., St. George), and northern Utah goes up to about 42 N. The border with Idaho is at 42 N parallel for part of it.

The 42nd parallel north is the border between Utah and Idaho for a section. Latitude 41.2279 is less than 42, so it's south of that border, thus in Utah.

Longitude -111.9682: Utah's western border with Nevada is not exactly on a longitude line, but it's jagged. However, around latitude 41 N, Utah extends west to about -113.5 W or something? No.

Nevada's eastern border is along the 114th meridian west for part, but it's not straight. Actually, the border between Utah and Nevada is primarily along the 114th meridian west, but there might be adjustments.

114 W is further west. Salt Lake City is at -111.89 W, and Nevada starts at about -114 W. So -111.9682 W is well within Utah.

Distance: From -111.89 to -114 is 2.11 degrees west, but -111.9682 is only about 0.0782 degrees west of Salt Lake City, so very close.

Moreover, Ogden is indeed at that latitude and longitude.

To be thorough, could this be in Wyoming or Idaho? Wyoming is east of Utah, starting around -111 W, but Wyoming's western border is with Idaho, and Utah's eastern border is with Wyoming at about -111 W in some parts.

Utah and Wyoming share a border. The border is along the 111th meridian west for part of it, but it's complex.

Actually, the western border of Wyoming is with Idaho, and eastern with South Dakota, etc. Utah's eastern border is with Colorado and then Wyoming in the north.

Specifically, the border between Utah and Wyoming is along the 111th meridian west from about 41 N to 42 N or something. I think it's the 111th meridian.

Upon thinking, the 111th meridian west is the border between Utah and Wyoming for a portion.

Longitude -111.9682 is west of 111 W? No: -111.9682 means 111.9682 W, which is slightly west of 111 W? Longitude increases westward when negative, but numerically, -111.9682 is more negative than -111, so it's further west.

Standard longitude: -111 W is 111 degrees west. -111.9682 W is 111.9682 degrees west, so it's west of -111 W.

If longitude is -111, that's 111 degrees west. -111.9682 is approximately -112 degrees (since 111.9682 is almost 112), so it's about 112 W.

Salt Lake City is at -111.89 W, which is 111.89 W, so -111.9682 W is 111.9682 W, which is slightly more than 111.89, so further west by about 0.0782 degrees.

Each degree of longitude is about 111 km at equator, less at higher latitudes, but roughly.

The 111th meridian is at -111 W exactly. So -111.9682 W is west of that.

Utah's eastern border with Wyoming: I believe the border follows the 111th meridian west from the Wyoming-Utah-Colorado tripoint up to about 41.999 N or something, but actually, it's along 111 W until it hits the Uinta Mountains or something. I need to recall.

Upon better recollection, the border between Utah and Wyoming is not straight on longitude. But generally, Ogden is west of the border.

Ogden is in Utah, and it's at longitude around -112 W, which is within Utah.

Wyoming's western part is around -111 W for its eastern side, but Wyoming spans longitudes from about -104 W to -111 W. Western Wyoming is around -111 W.

For example, Jackson, Wyoming, is at about -110.76 W, and the western border of Wyoming is with Idaho at approximately -111.05 W or something. I think the border is irregular.

But safely, longitude -111.9682 W is likely in Utah. Latitude 41.2279 N is consistent with northern Utah.

I can think about the coordinate: 41.2279, -111.9682. If I were to look it up, but since I can't, I rely on memory.

Another way: I know that the coordinate is very close to Ogden, Utah, which is a city in Utah.

Moreover, to confirm, let's think about adjacent states:

- North: Idaho, but Idaho starts at 42 N parallel for part of the border.

- South: Utah extends south.

- East: Wyoming, but as longitude is around -112 W, and Wyoming's western border is further east.

Wyoming's longitude range: From about -104.05 W (eastern border) to -111.05 W (western border with Idaho).

Idaho's eastern border with Wyoming is around -111 W, and Utah's border with Wyoming is to the south.

The tripoint of Utah-Wyoming-Idaho is at approximately 42 N, 111 W.

At latitude 42 N, longitude 111 W is the corner.

Given latitude is 41.2279 N, which is south of 42 N, so it's below that line.

And longitude -111.9682 W is west of 111 W? -111.9682 is more negative, so further west than 111 W.

111 W is -111.000, and -111.9682 is approximately -112 W, so longitude 112 W.

At latitude 41.2279 N, which is south of 42 N, the border between Utah and Wyoming is along a different line.

Actually, south of the Uinta Mountains, the border might follow a different path, but generally, at around 41.2 N, longitude around 112 W should be in Utah.

For example, Logan, Utah, is at about 41.74 N, -111.83 W, which is east of this coordinate.

Ogden is at 41.22 N, -111.97 W, as I thought.

I can confidently say it's in Utah.

Finally, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should conclude with the state name.
