*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 38.6359 and longitude -90.2451 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 38.6359 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -90.2451 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different latitude and longitude ranges. Longitude -90 is around the Mississippi River area. I think that's in the central part of the US.

Let me think about specific states:

- Missouri has St. Louis, and I believe St. Louis is around there. I think the Gateway Arch in St. Louis is at approximately 38.6257 latitude and -90.1848 longitude. That's close to 38.6359 and -90.2451.

Calculating the difference: Latitude 38.6359 vs. 38.6257 is a difference of about 0.0102 degrees. Since 1 degree of latitude is about 111 km, 0.0102 degrees is roughly 1.13 km. Longitude difference: -90.2451 vs. -90.1848 is about 0.0603 degrees. At latitude 38, 1 degree of longitude is about 85 km (since it decreases towards the poles), so 0.0603 degrees is roughly 5.12 km. So, very close proximity.

St. Louis is in Missouri. So, probably, this location is in Missouri.

But to be thorough, I should confirm if it's exactly in Missouri or perhaps in a neighboring state. Nearby states include Illinois across the river, but longitude -90.2451 is west of the Mississippi River, I think. The Mississippi River in St. Louis area is around longitude -90.2 or so. Actually, the river might be at about -90.19, so -90.2451 is slightly west, still in Missouri.

I can think about the state boundaries. Missouri's eastern border is the Mississippi River, so west of that should be Missouri.

Another way to confirm: I know that latitude 38.6359 is around the level of central US, and longitude -90 is definitely in the Midwest.

Possible states: Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, etc., but latitude 38.6 is too north for Tennessee or Kentucky; Kentucky is around 37-39, but longitude -90 is west, so Missouri or Illinois.

Illinois is east of the Mississippi, so longitude would be more negative if west, wait no: longitude increases eastward, but since it's negative, -90.2451 is west. Standard longitude: more negative means further west.

Prime Meridian is 0, so -90 is 90 degrees west. In the US, longitude decreases (more negative) as you go west.

St. Louis: the city is on the west bank of the Mississippi, so in Missouri. East of the river is Illinois.

Given longitude -90.2451, and I think the Mississippi at St. Louis is around -90.20, so -90.2451 is slightly west, confirming Missouri.

I can recall that the coordinates given are very close to St. Louis, which is in Missouri.

To be precise, I should state the state.

The user asked for the state, and to put the final answer in a new line at the end.

So, my response should be helpful, perhaps explain a bit, but keep it concise, and end with the answer.

Final answer should be: Missouri

But let me double-check the coordinates. Is there any chance it's in another state? For example, if it's exactly on the border, but 38.6359, -90.2451 seems inland a bit.

I can think about famous places: Latitude 38.6359, longitude -90.2451 â€“ if I search my memory, it might be near Lambert-St. Louis International Airport or something, but I think it's in Missouri.

Yes, I'm confident.
