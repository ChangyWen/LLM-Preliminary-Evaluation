*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 39.3051 and longitude -76.6144 is located. I need to identify the state based on these coordinates.

Latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. Latitude 39.3051 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -76.6144 is west of the Prime Meridian, so it's in the western hemisphere.

I recall that the United States has various states with different coordinates. I need to think about which state this might be in.

Longitude -76 is around the East Coast of the US. For example, New York City is around 40.7128 N, -74.0060 W, which is close but not exact. Latitude 39.3051 is a bit south of that.

I think Baltimore, Maryland, is around there. Let me confirm: I believe Baltimore's coordinates are approximately 39.2904 N, -76.6122 W. That's very close to 39.3051 N, -76.6144 W.

So, this is likely in Maryland.

To be thorough, I should consider if it could be in another state. Latitude 39 is shared by several states: Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, etc. But longitude -76 is more specific.

- Pennsylvania is further north and west.

- Delaware is east of Maryland.

- Virginia is south, around latitude 37-39, but longitude might be different.

Longitude -76: Maryland's eastern shore might have different longitudes, but central Maryland, like Baltimore, is around -76.

I can think about the coordinates:

- Washington D.C. is at about 38.9072 N, -77.0369 W.

- Baltimore is north of D.C., so higher latitude, which matches 39.3051.

The difference: from D.C. to Baltimore is about 40 miles north, so latitude increase makes sense.

Longitude is similar, -76.6144 vs D.C.'s -77, so slightly east.

D.C. is -77, Baltimore is -76.6, so yes, Baltimore is east of D.C.

So, this is definitely in the Baltimore area.

Now, is it in Maryland? Baltimore is a city in Maryland, so the state should be Maryland.

But to be precise, I should confirm if these exact coordinates are within Maryland's borders.

Maryland's boundaries: it borders Pennsylvania to the north, West Virginia and Virginia to the west and south, Delaware and the Atlantic to the east.

Latitude 39.3051: the Mason-Dixon line is at about 39.716 N, which is the boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland. Mason-Dixon is the boundary, and it's at 39Â°43' N for part of it, but Maryland extends south.

Latitude 39.3051 is south of 39.716, so it should be in Maryland, not Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania is north of the Mason-Dixon line, so latitudes above about 39.7 are Pennsylvania, below are Maryland in that longitude.

Longitude -76.6144: Maryland's western border with West Virginia is around longitude -79, so -76 is well within Maryland.

Eastern border with Delaware is around -75.5 or so, I think Delaware is further east.

Delaware's longitude: Wilmington is around -75.5, so -76 is west of that, so in Maryland.

So, definitely within Maryland.

Perhaps it's in a specific city or area, but the question asks for the state.

Final answer should be Maryland.

The user said to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response.

So, I need to structure my response: maybe explain a bit, then give the answer.

But the user didn't ask for explanation, just the answer, but it's good to be helpful.

Looking back: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I can have some reasoning, but end with the answer on a new line.

As an AI, I should be accurate. In a real scenario, I might use a geolocation API, but based on knowledge, it's Maryland.

I think it's safe.
