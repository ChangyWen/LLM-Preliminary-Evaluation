*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user asked for the state where the place with latitude 26.6443 and longitude -81.9957 is located. I need to determine which US state this coordinate corresponds to.

Latitude and longitude are geographic coordinates. Latitude 26.6443 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -81.9957 is west of the Prime Meridian. Negative longitude indicates the western hemisphere.

I know that the US has states in various latitudes and longitudes. Latitude 26.6443 is quite south. For reference, Miami, Florida, is around 25.76 latitude, so this is a bit north of Miami. Florida extends up to about 31 degrees north, so this could be in Florida.

Longitude -81.9957 is around -82 degrees. Florida's west coast is around -80 to -87 longitude. Let's think about specific cities. For example, Fort Myers, Florida, is around 26.6 latitude and -81.8 longitude. That sounds very close.

I recall that Fort Myers is approximately at 26.6414° N, 81.8425° W. The given coordinates are 26.6443 N and -81.9957 W. -81.9957 is almost -82.0000, so it's very close to Fort Myers.

Fort Myers is in Florida, specifically in Lee County, Florida.

To be precise, I should confirm if this exact coordinate is within Florida's boundaries. Florida is the southernmost continental US state, and its panhandle goes west, but latitude 26.6 is definitely in the southern part.

Other states: Texas goes down to about 26 degrees north at its southern tip, but that's longitude around -97, which is much west. -81.9957 is eastern, so not Texas.

Longitude -82 is around the eastern seaboard. States like Georgia, South Carolina, etc., are at higher latitudes. Georgia starts around 30-31 north, so latitude 26.6 is too south for those.

The Bahamas or other countries might be nearby, but the user is asking for a state, implying a US state. Latitude 26.6 and longitude -82 is definitely within the US, in Florida.

To be thorough, I can think about the bounding box for Florida. Florida's southernmost point is Key West at about 24.5 N, and northern boundary around 31 N. Western longitude from about -87.6 to -80.0 or so.

-81.9957 is within -87.6 to -80.0, and latitude 26.6443 is between 24.5 and 31, so yes, Florida.

Moreover, this specific coordinate is likely in or near Fort Myers. I can assume it's in Florida.

The user said "state", and in the US context, it's probably Florida. But just to make sure, are there any other US territories or states? No, Puerto Rico is around 18 N, too south, and other islands are not at this latitude.

So, I think it's safe to say Florida.

Now, the user asked to put the final answer in a new line at the end of the response. So, I should structure my response accordingly.

Perhaps I can say something like: "Based on the given latitude and longitude, the location is in the state of Florida."

And then, on a new line, just "Florida".

The instruction is: "Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response."

So, I should have some reasoning or explanation, and then the answer.

But in this case, since I'm an AI, I can provide a concise response.

Final answer should be: Florida

And make sure it's on a new line.
