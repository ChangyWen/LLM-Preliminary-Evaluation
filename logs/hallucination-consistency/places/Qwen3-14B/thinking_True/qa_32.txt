Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 40.7834 latitude and -73.9662 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. I remember that latitude 40.7834 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -73.9662 is in the western hemisphere. 

I think New York City is around that area. Let me confirm. The coordinates for New York City are approximately 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W. The given latitude here is 40.7834, which is a bit north of NYC's latitude. The longitude is -73.9662, which is 73.9662 degrees west. Comparing that to NYC's longitude of 74.0060, this is slightly east of NYC. 

So, maybe this is a specific location within New York City. Let me check if there's a known landmark or area with those coordinates. I recall that the latitude and longitude given might be for a place like the Empire State Building or another landmark. Wait, the Empire State Building is at around 40.7488° N, 73.9858° W. The given coordinates are a bit further north and east. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a different part of New York. Since the longitude is -73.9662, which is 73.9662 west, that's actually east of the NYC longitude. So, maybe it's in Brooklyn or Queens? But I need to be sure. 

Another approach: using a map or a geolocation tool. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. The coordinates 40.7834, -73.9662 are in the northern part of New York City, possibly in the Bronx or Manhattan. Wait, the latitude 40.7834 is about 40 degrees, 47 minutes north. Let me convert that. 0.7834 degrees is 0.7834 * 60 = 47.004 minutes. So 40 degrees 47 minutes north. 

New York City's latitude ranges roughly from 40° 30' N to 41° N. So 40°47' is within that range. The longitude is 73° 57.972' W (since 0.9662 * 60 = 57.972). NYC's longitude is around 74° W, so 73°58' is just east of that. That would place it in Manhattan, perhaps near the Upper East Side or somewhere in that area. 

Since the coordinates are within NYC, the state would be New York. Therefore, the answer should be New York.
