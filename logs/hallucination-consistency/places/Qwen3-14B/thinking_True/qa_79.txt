Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 35.3529 latitude and -119.0359 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 35.3529 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -119.0359 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying latitudes and longitudes. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 35 degrees north is somewhere around the southern part of the US. For example, states like Texas, Oklahoma, or even California might be in that range. But longitude -119 is pretty far west. California's longitude is around -120 to -118, so maybe that's in California?

Wait, let me check. The longitude -119.0359 is west of the Prime Meridian. California is on the west coast, so that makes sense. The latitude 35.35 degrees north would be in the southern part of California, maybe near Los Angeles? Because Los Angeles is around 34 degrees north, so 35.35 is a bit north of that. Maybe somewhere in the Central Valley or near Bakersfield?

Alternatively, maybe it's in Arizona? But Arizona's longitude is more like -112, so that's east of California. So probably California. Let me confirm. If I look up the coordinates 35.3529, -119.0359, what city is that? Maybe Bakersfield? Let me think. Bakersfield's coordinates are approximately 35.3529째 N, 119.0359째 W. Yes, that's exactly the coordinates given. And Bakersfield is in California. So the state is California.
