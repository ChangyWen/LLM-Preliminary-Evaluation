Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 42.1155 latitude and -72.5395 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to.

Latitude 42.1155 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -72.5395 is in the western hemisphere. The longitude is negative, which means it's west of the Prime Meridian. Let me think about the approximate locations. 

I know that the United States has a lot of states in the eastern part. For example, New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire are in that area. Let me recall the approximate coordinates for some cities. Boston, Massachusetts, is around 42.3601° N, 71.0589° W. That's pretty close to the given latitude of 42.1155, but the longitude here is -72.5395, which is further west. 

Wait, maybe it's in Vermont or New Hampshire? Let me check. The longitude of -72.5395 is about 72.5 degrees west. Let me think about the longitude of Boston again. Boston is at about 71 degrees west. So moving west from there, maybe around 72.5 degrees west would be in Vermont or New Hampshire. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Connecticut? But Connecticut's longitude is more like 72 to 73 degrees west. Wait, but the latitude here is 42.1155, which is a bit south of Boston's latitude. Let me think about the coordinates. 

Another approach: I can use a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my existing knowledge. Let me think of major cities in that area. Springfield, Massachusetts is at around 42.1011° N, 72.5871° W. That's very close to the given coordinates. The latitude is 42.1011, which is almost 42.1155, and the longitude is 72.5871, which is slightly more west than -72.5395. Wait, the given longitude is -72.5395, which is 72.5395 degrees west. So Springfield's longitude is 72.5871, which is a bit further west. So the given coordinates are a bit east of Springfield. 

If Springfield is in Massachusetts, then the coordinates might be in Massachusetts. Alternatively, maybe it's in Connecticut? Let me check. Hartford, Connecticut is at 41.7657° N, 72.6714° W. That's a bit south and further west. The latitude here is 42.1155, which is north of Hartford. So maybe it's in Massachusetts. 

Another city in Massachusetts is Worcester. Worcester's coordinates are approximately 42.2685° N, 71.8793° W. That's a bit north and east of the given coordinates. So the given coordinates are south of Worcester and west of Boston. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in New Hampshire? Let me think. Concord, New Hampshire is at 43.1976° N, 71.5413° W. That's further north and east. So the latitude here is 42.1155, which is south of Concord. 

So putting it all together, the coordinates 42.1155° N, 72.5395° W are likely in Massachusetts, possibly near the border with Connecticut or Vermont. But since Springfield is in Massachusetts and the coordinates are close to that, I think the state is Massachusetts.
