Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 42.9018 latitude and -78.8487 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 42.9018 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -78.8487 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the northern latitudes. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 42 degrees is around the area of New York, Pennsylvania, maybe Ohio? But longitude -78 degrees west... Let me recall. The longitude for New York City is around -74 degrees, so -78 is further west. That would be more towards Pennsylvania or maybe Ohio? Wait, Pittsburgh is in Pennsylvania, and its longitude is around -79.99, which is more west than -78.84. So maybe it's in western New York state?

Wait, Buffalo, New York is at around 42.89 degrees latitude and -78.88 degrees longitude. That's very close to the given coordinates. So that would put it in New York State. Let me check if there's any other possibility. Maybe Ohio? But Ohio's longitude is more around -83 degrees or so. No, that's too far west. Pennsylvania's longitude ranges from around -77 to -75 on the east, but the given longitude is -78.84, which is west of Pittsburgh. So that's probably in western New York, maybe near Buffalo. Therefore, the state should be New York.
