Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 41.6638 latitude and -83.5827 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 41.6638 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -83.5827 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the central and eastern regions. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 41 degrees is around the area of cities like Chicago, which is in Illinois. But longitude -83.58 is west of Chicago. Wait, Chicago's longitude is around -87.6, so -83.58 would be further east. Maybe Ohio? Ohio's longitude ranges from around -84 to -81. So -83.58 is within that range. 

Alternatively, maybe it's near Cincinnati, Ohio. Let me check. Cincinnati's coordinates are approximately 39.1031° N, 84.5120° W. Hmm, that's a bit south and west. Wait, the given latitude is 41.66, which is north of Cincinnati. Maybe it's in the northern part of Ohio. 

Another approach: using an online map or a geographical database. But since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on my knowledge. The latitude 41.66 is about 41 degrees north, which is similar to cities like Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland's coordinates are around 41.4995° N, 81.6944° W. Wait, the longitude here is -83.58, which is more west than Cleveland. So maybe it's in Indiana? Indiana's longitude ranges from about -87.5 to -84.5. Wait, -83.58 is east of Indiana. 

Wait, maybe it's in Ohio. Let me think again. Ohio's western border is around longitude -84.5. So -83.58 is east of that, which would be within Ohio. So the coordinates 41.6638, -83.5827 would be in Ohio. 

Alternatively, maybe it's near Dayton, Ohio. Dayton's coordinates are approximately 39.7589° N, 84.1918° W. That's a bit south and west. But the latitude given is higher, so maybe further north. Maybe near Toledo, Ohio? Toledo is around 41.67° N, 83.69° W. Oh, that's very close! The given latitude is 41.6638, which is just slightly south of Toledo's latitude, and the longitude is -83.5827, which is slightly east of Toledo's -83.69. So that would place it near Toledo, Ohio. Therefore, the state is Ohio.
