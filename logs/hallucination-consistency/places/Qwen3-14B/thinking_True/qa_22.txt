Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 36.2333 latitude and -115.2654 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 36.2333 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -115.2654 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying coordinates. Let me think about the approximate locations. The longitude -115 is west of the Prime Meridian. Let me recall that the longitude for Las Vegas is around -115.1398, which is close to -115.2654. Wait, but that's a bit west of Las Vegas. Maybe it's in Nevada? But I should check.

Alternatively, maybe it's in California? But California's longitude is more around -120 degrees. Wait, no, the longitude here is -115, which is east of California's westernmost points. So Nevada is west of California. Let me think about the latitude. 36 degrees north is roughly the latitude of places like Las Vegas, which is in Nevada. Las Vegas is at about 36.1699° N, 115.1398° W. The given coordinates are 36.2333° N, which is a bit north of Las Vegas, and longitude -115.2654, which is a bit west. So that might be in the area of Nevada, maybe near the California border?

Wait, but I should confirm. Maybe using a map or a geographical database. Alternatively, I can think of other cities. For example, the coordinates 36.2333, -115.2654 might be near the town of Searchlight, Nevada, which is a small town near the California border. Alternatively, it could be in Clark County, Nevada, which includes Las Vegas. 

Another approach: the longitude -115.2654 is approximately 115.27 degrees west. Let me check the boundaries of Nevada. Nevada's western border is with California, and the longitude around there would be in the range of -115 to -114 degrees. So yes, that's within Nevada. The latitude 36.23 is in the southern part of Nevada, which is around the same latitude as Las Vegas. 

I think the answer is Nevada. But to be sure, maybe I can cross-check with a known location. For example, the coordinates 36.1699, -115.1398 are Las Vegas, Nevada. The given coordinates are a bit further north and west. So that would still be in Nevada. Therefore, the state is Nevada.
