Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 36.1715 latitude and -86.7842 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 36.1715 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -86.7842 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the central and southern regions with those latitudes. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 36 degrees is around the area of Tennessee, Kentucky, or maybe Missouri. Longitude -86.78 is west of the Mississippi River, so that would be in the central US.

Wait, Nashville, Tennessee is a major city there. Let me check the coordinates for Nashville. I think Nashville's coordinates are approximately 36.1699째 N, 86.7842째 W. Oh, that's really close to the given coordinates. So that must be Nashville, Tennessee. Therefore, the state would be Tennessee.

But just to be sure, maybe I should cross-verify. Let me think about other cities in that area. Memphis is further south, maybe around 35 degrees latitude. Chattanooga is a bit further east. So yes, Nashville is in the middle of Tennessee. The coordinates given are very close to Nashville's, so the state is definitely Tennessee.
