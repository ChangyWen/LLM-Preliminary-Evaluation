Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 40.7498 latitude and -73.7976 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. I remember that latitude 40.7 degrees is around New York City, but I should confirm.

Wait, latitude 40.7498 is approximately 40.75, which is pretty close to NYC's latitude. The longitude is -73.7976, which is about -73.8. I know that NYC's longitude is roughly -74, so this might be a bit east of NYC. Let me think. The coordinates for New York City are usually around 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W. So this longitude is -73.7976, which is slightly east of NYC's longitude. That might place it in a nearby area, maybe New Jersey? Wait, but NYC is in New York state. Wait, but the longitude here is less negative, meaning it's east. So maybe it's in New York City itself, but perhaps a specific neighborhood?

Alternatively, maybe it's in New Jersey. Let me check. For example, the coordinates for Manhattan are around 40.7128, -74.0060. If the longitude is -73.7976, that's about 0.2 degrees east, which is roughly 22 kilometers east. That might be in New Jersey, but I'm not sure. Wait, the longitude of NYC is around -74, so moving east (less negative) would be towards the east coast, but New York state extends eastward. Wait, actually, the eastern part of New York state is near the Atlantic Ocean, but the coordinates here are in the middle of the coast. Wait, maybe it's in New York City, but in a different borough? Or maybe it's in New Jersey?

Alternatively, I can use a map or a geolocation tool. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think of major cities. The coordinates 40.7498, -73.7976. Let me compare with known places. For example, the coordinates for New York City's Central Park are approximately 40.7829° N, 73.9654° W. Wait, that's a bit north and west. The given latitude here is 40.7498, which is slightly south of Central Park. The longitude is -73.7976, which is east of Central Park's longitude (-73.9654). So moving east from Central Park would be towards the eastern part of NYC, maybe Brooklyn or Queens? But Brooklyn is part of New York City. Alternatively, maybe it's in New Jersey, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the longitude of -73.7976 is about 73.8 degrees west. Let me think of the longitude of New York City. The city's longitude is around 74 degrees west, so this is slightly east of that. So if I'm east of NYC's longitude, that would be towards the east, but NYC is on the coast. So maybe it's in New York City itself, but in a part that's more eastern. Alternatively, maybe it's in New Jersey, but I need to check.

Wait, the latitude is 40.7498, which is about 40.75 degrees north. Let me think of the latitude of New York City. NYC is around 40.7128° N, so this is a bit north. So combining that, the coordinates are a bit north and east of NYC's central coordinates. That might be in the northern part of NYC, like the Bronx or parts of Manhattan. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's in New Jersey, but I need to think of places there. For example, the latitude of New Jersey is similar to NYC, but the longitude might be different. Wait, if it's east of NYC, maybe it's in the eastern part of New York state, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I can think of the coordinates as being in the vicinity of the New York City area. Since the latitude is close to NYC's and the longitude is slightly east, it's possible that it's still within New York City. However, I should also consider that the exact location might be in a neighboring state. But given that the longitude is -73.7976, which is very close to NYC's longitude, I think it's safe to say that it's in New York state, specifically in New York City. Therefore, the state would be New York.
