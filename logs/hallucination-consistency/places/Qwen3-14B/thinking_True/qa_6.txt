Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 29.786 latitude and -95.3885 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 29.786 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -95.3885 is in the western hemisphere since it's negative. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the central and southern regions. Let me think about major cities. Houston, Texas comes to mind because I know that Houston's coordinates are around 29.76 degrees north and 95.36 degrees west. The given coordinates are 29.786 and -95.3885, which are very close to Houston's coordinates. 

So, if Houston is in Texas, then those coordinates must be in Texas as well. Let me double-check. Maybe I can recall other cities in Texas. San Antonio is further south, maybe around 29.4 degrees, but that's a bit lower. Dallas is more north, like 32 degrees or so. So Houston is indeed around 29.7 degrees latitude. The longitude of -95.3885 is about 95.39 west, which matches Houston's longitude. 

Another way to confirm is to think about the time zone. Texas is in the Central Time Zone, and those coordinates would be in that time zone. Also, the Gulf Coast area, which includes Houston, is in Texas. I don't think there's another major state with a city that has those exact coordinates. Maybe Louisiana or Oklahoma? But Louisiana's major cities are New Orleans, which is around 30 degrees north, but longitude is more like 90 degrees west. Oklahoma is further north and west. So no, it's definitely Texas. 

I think that's solid. The coordinates point to Houston, Texas, so the state is Texas.
