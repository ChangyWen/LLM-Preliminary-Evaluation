Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 43.0642 latitude and -87.9675 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 43.0642 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -87.9675 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying latitudes and longitudes. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 43 degrees north is somewhere around the middle of the US. For example, Chicago is known to be around 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W. Wait, the longitude here is -87.9675, which is more west than Chicago's longitude. So maybe it's a bit further west.

Looking at the longitude, -87.9675 is approximately 87.97 degrees west. Chicago is at about 87.63 degrees west, so this is a bit further west. Maybe in Illinois? But I should check if there are other states nearby. Let me think about the Great Lakes region. Michigan is to the north of Illinois, but their longitudes are different. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Indiana? Wait, Indiana's longitude ranges are around 84 to 88 degrees west. So 87.97 is within that range. But latitude 43.06 is about 43 degrees north. Let me recall that Indianapolis, Indiana, is around 39.7684° N, 86.1581° W. That's a bit south and east. So maybe further north in Indiana?

Wait, maybe it's in Wisconsin? Wisconsin's latitude ranges from about 42 to 47 degrees north. The longitude for Wisconsin is around 87 to 90 degrees west. So 43.06 latitude and 87.97 longitude would be in the western part of Wisconsin. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's in Illinois, near the western border. 

Alternatively, I can think of major cities. Let me check if there's a city near those coordinates. If I plug in 43.0642, -87.9675 into a map, what would that be? Let me try to recall. The coordinates 43.0642° N, 87.9675° W. Wait, that's very close to the coordinates of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Milwaukee is at approximately 43.0389° N, 87.9817° W. So that's very close. So the coordinates given are just a bit south and east of Milwaukee. Therefore, the state would be Wisconsin. 

But I should double-check. Let me think about the exact coordinates. If Milwaukee is at 43.0389° N, then 43.0642 is a bit north of that. The longitude is -87.9675, which is 87.9675° W. Milwaukee's longitude is 87.9817° W, so the given longitude is slightly east of Milwaukee. So the location is just a bit north and east of Milwaukee, which is still in Wisconsin. 

Therefore, the state is Wisconsin.
