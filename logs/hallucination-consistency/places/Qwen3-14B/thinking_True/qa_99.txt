Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 33.2175 latitude and -97.1418 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 33.2175 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -97.1418 is in the western hemisphere since it's negative. 

I remember that the United States spans a range of latitudes and longitudes. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 33 degrees is around the area of Texas, Oklahoma, and parts of New Mexico. Longitude -97 degrees would be west of the central part of the country. 

Wait, Oklahoma City is in Oklahoma, and I think its coordinates are around 35.47 degrees north and 97.5 degrees west. But the longitude here is -97.14, which is slightly east of Oklahoma City. Maybe it's in central Oklahoma? Let me check some landmarks. 

Another thought: the city of Norman, Oklahoma is near 35.2 degrees north and 97.3 degrees west. Hmm, but the latitude given here is 33.2, which is lower. That would be more southern. Maybe in Texas? Let me think about Texas cities. 

Dallas is around 32.78 degrees north and 96.8 degrees west. So Dallas is at about 32.78, which is a bit north of 33.2175. Wait, no, 32.78 is less than 33.2175, so Dallas is a bit south of the given latitude. But longitude -97.14 is west of Dallas's longitude of -96.8. So maybe the location is between Dallas and Oklahoma City? 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Texas. Let me check the approximate coordinates. If I consider that Texas spans from about 31 degrees north to 37 degrees north latitude, and longitude from about 93 to 106 degrees west. So 33.2175 is within that range. The longitude -97.14 is within Texas's longitude range as well. 

Wait, but Oklahoma is also in that area. How to differentiate? Maybe looking at the exact coordinates. Let me think of a city in Texas that's around 33 degrees north and 97 degrees west. Maybe Fort Worth? Fort Worth is at approximately 32.75 degrees north and 97.33 degrees west. That's a bit north and west of the given coordinates. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the Oklahoma panhandle? But Oklahoma's southern part is near Texas. Let me check if there's a city in Oklahoma with those coordinates. Maybe the coordinates are in the central part of Oklahoma. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my existing knowledge. Another approach: the longitude -97.14 is about 97.14 degrees west. The prime meridian is 0, so moving west, 90 degrees is the 90th meridian, which is in the central US. Oklahoma is west of Texas. 

Wait, Texas is to the south of Oklahoma. So if the latitude is 33.2, which is lower than Oklahoma's average latitude (which is around 35-37 degrees), then maybe it's in Texas. For example, the city of Abilene, Texas is at about 31.97 degrees north and 98.5 degrees west. That's too far west. 

Wait, maybe the coordinates are in the central part of Texas. Let me think of the coordinates 33.2175, -97.1418. If I convert that to a rough location, maybe it's near the city of Waco, Texas? Waco is around 31.5 degrees north and 97.1 degrees west. That's a bit south and very close in longitude. So maybe the given coordinates are a bit north of Waco. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Oklahoma. Let me think of Oklahoma's southern border. Oklahoma's southernmost point is near the Texas border. If the latitude is 33.2, that's just north of the Texas-Oklahoma border. So maybe it's in Oklahoma. 

Wait, but Oklahoma's southern border is at about 33.5 degrees north. So 33.2175 is just south of that. That would place it in Texas. Because Oklahoma's southern border is around 33.5, so 33.2 is south of that, which would be in Texas. 

Therefore, the coordinates 33.2175, -97.1418 are in Texas. Let me confirm once more. If I consider that the Texas-Oklahoma border is around 33.5 degrees north, then 33.2 is south of that, so in Texas. The longitude -97.14 is within Texas's longitude range. So the answer should be Texas.
