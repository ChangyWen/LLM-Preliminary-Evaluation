Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 39.1238 latitude and -94.5541 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out how to determine the state from these coordinates.

I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location on a map. Latitude 39.1238 is in the northern hemisphere since it's positive. The longitude is -94.5541, which is west of the Prime Meridian. Now, I need to figure out which U.S. state this falls into.

I know that the United States spans a range of latitudes and longitudes. Let me think about the approximate ranges. For example, states like Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska are in the central part of the U.S. Their longitudes are around -95 to -90, which matches the given longitude of -94.55. The latitude of 39.12 is in the mid-latitudes, which would place it in the central or eastern part of the country.

Looking at Missouri, its approximate latitude range is around 36°N to 41°N, and longitude from about -96°W to -89°W. The given coordinates are 39.12°N and -94.55°W, which falls within Missouri's range. Let me cross-check with another state. Kansas is a bit more west, maybe around -95 to -94 longitude, but latitude similar. However, the exact coordinates might be in Missouri. 

Alternatively, I can use an online tool or a map to check, but since I can't access external resources, I'll have to rely on my knowledge. Another way is to think of major cities. For example, Kansas City is in Missouri and Kansas. The coordinates might be near Kansas City. Let me recall that Kansas City, Missouri is at approximately 39.0991° N, 94.5786° W. The given longitude is -94.5541, which is slightly east of Kansas City's longitude. So that would place it in Missouri, maybe near the eastern part of the state. 

Alternatively, if I consider the longitude of -94.55, that's about 94.55 degrees west. Since the Prime Meridian is 0°, moving west increases the longitude value. So -94.55 is 94.55 degrees west. Missouri's westernmost point is around -94.5°, so this longitude is just east of that. Therefore, the location is likely in Missouri. 

I think the answer is Missouri. Let me confirm once more. If I think of the state boundaries, Missouri's longitude ranges from about -96° to -89°, so -94.55 is within that. The latitude of 39.12 is within Missouri's latitude range. Therefore, the state is Missouri.
