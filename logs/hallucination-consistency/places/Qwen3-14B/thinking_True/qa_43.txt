Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 30.3322 latitude and -81.6749 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 30.3322 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -81.6749 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the southeastern region. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude of 30 degrees is around the area of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, maybe even parts of Texas. But longitude -81.67 is west of the prime meridian. Let me check some major cities. For example, Atlanta, Georgia is around 33.7488° N, 84.3879° W. That's a bit further west. Jacksonville, Florida is about 30.3322° N, 81.6657° W. Wait, that's almost exactly the coordinates given here. So that would be Jacksonville, Florida. 

But I should confirm. Let me think about other cities. Savannah, Georgia is around 32.0838° N, 81.0998° W. That's a bit north and east. So the coordinates given are very close to Jacksonville. Therefore, the state would be Florida. But I should make sure there's no other city in another state with similar coordinates. Maybe check if there's a place in Georgia or Alabama nearby. But given that the longitude is -81.67, which is west of Savannah's longitude, but Jacksonville is in Florida. So I think the answer is Florida.
