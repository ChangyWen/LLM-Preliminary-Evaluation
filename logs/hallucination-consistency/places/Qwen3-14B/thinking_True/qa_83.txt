Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 40.2457 latitude and -111.6457 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out how to determine the state from these coordinates.

I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location on a map. Latitude 40.2457 is in the northern hemisphere since it's positive. The longitude is -111.6457, which is west of the Prime Meridian. Now, I need to figure out which U.S. state this would be in.

I know that the United States spans a wide range of longitudes. Let me think about the approximate longitudes of different states. For example, states in the central part of the country like Colorado or Kansas have longitudes around -105 to -100. Moving further west, states like Utah or Nevada would be around -112 to -114. Wait, the longitude here is -111.6457, which is just east of -112. So that might be in Utah or maybe Nevada?

Let me check the approximate latitude. 40.2457 degrees north. The latitude for Utah ranges roughly from about 37°N to 41°N. So 40 degrees north is within that range. Nevada's latitude is similar, but maybe a bit more southern. Let me think about specific cities. Salt Lake City, Utah, is around 40.76°N, 111.89°W. The given longitude here is -111.6457, which is east of Salt Lake City's longitude. So maybe a bit to the east of Salt Lake City?

Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Colorado? Wait, Colorado's longitude is more around -105 to -102. So that's east of the given longitude. So probably not Colorado. Let me think about other states. Arizona is further south, so maybe not. New Mexico? Their longitudes are around -106 to -103, so again east of the given longitude. So that's not it.

So back to Utah. If Salt Lake City is at -111.89, then the given longitude is -111.6457, which is about 0.24 degrees east, which is roughly 14 miles east. So that would be near the eastern part of Utah. Let me check if there are any major cities or landmarks there. Maybe the city of Provo? Wait, Provo is in Utah, and its coordinates are around 40.2457° N, 111.6457° W. Wait, that's exactly the coordinates given! So that's Provo, Utah. Therefore, the state is Utah.

But just to be sure, maybe I should cross-verify. Let me think about other possibilities. Could it be in Idaho? Idaho's longitude is more around -116 to -111, but the latitude for Idaho is more northern, like 42-47 degrees. So 40 degrees is a bit south for Idaho. So probably not. Wyoming? Wyoming's latitude is around 41-45, so 40.24 is a bit south. But longitude for Wyoming is around -104 to -111. So maybe the western part of Wyoming? But the longitude here is -111.64, which is near the western edge of Wyoming. However, the latitude of 40.24 is a bit lower than Wyoming's typical range. So maybe the southern part of Wyoming? But I think Provo, Utah is more likely.

Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Nevada? Nevada's latitude ranges from about 36°N to 42°N, so 40.24 is within that. But longitude for Nevada is around -114 to -116, which is more west than the given longitude. So the given longitude is -111.64, which is east of Nevada. So that's probably not Nevada.

Therefore, the most likely state is Utah. The coordinates point to Provo, Utah. So the answer should be Utah.
