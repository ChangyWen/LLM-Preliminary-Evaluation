Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 30.442 latitude and -91.1311 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 30.442 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -91.1311 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the southern and central regions. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 30 degrees is around the southern part of the US, like Texas, Louisiana, or maybe even Florida. But longitude -91 degrees is pretty far west. Let me check some major cities. 

New Orleans is in Louisiana, and I think its coordinates are around 30 degrees north and 90 degrees west. Wait, the longitude here is -91.13, which is a bit further west than New Orleans. Maybe that's in the Mississippi River area? Or perhaps in Arkansas? 

Alternatively, I can use a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge. Let me think about the states that are around that latitude and longitude. 

Louisiana is between 30 and 32 degrees north latitude, and longitudes around -90 to -93. So -91.13 would be within Louisiana's longitude range. Also, the latitude 30.44 is within Louisiana's latitude range. 

Another way to check is to think about the Gulf Coast. Louisiana is along the Gulf of Mexico, and that area would have those coordinates. Maybe near Lake Providence or somewhere in the central part of Louisiana. 

I think the answer is Louisiana. But I should make sure there's no other state that could be in that area. Arkansas is a bit further north, and Texas is to the west but maybe not that far east. So yes, I'm pretty confident it's Louisiana.
