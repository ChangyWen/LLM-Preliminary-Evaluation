Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 33.5722 latitude and -112.0892 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 33.5722 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -112.0892 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying coordinates. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 33 degrees is around the area of the southern United States, like Texas, Oklahoma, or maybe even parts of California. But longitude -112 is pretty far west. Let me recall the longitudes of some states. Arizona is around that longitude range. For example, Phoenix, the capital of Arizona, is at approximately 33.4484째 N, 112.0740째 W. Comparing that to the given coordinates: 33.5722 is a bit north of Phoenix's latitude, and -112.0892 is slightly west of Phoenix's longitude. 

So that would place the location near Phoenix, Arizona. But wait, maybe I should check if there's another city or area with those coordinates. Alternatively, maybe it's in New Mexico? Let me think. New Mexico's longitude is generally around -106 to -103, so that's east of Arizona. So probably Arizona. 

Another way to confirm is to think about the time zone. Arizona is in the Mountain Time Zone, which is UTC-7 or UTC-8 depending on daylight saving. The longitude of -112 is within the Mountain Time Zone. Also, the latitude 33.57 is in the southern part of Arizona, maybe near Tucson or somewhere in the Phoenix metropolitan area. 

I think the answer is Arizona. Let me just make sure there's no other state with similar coordinates. Nevada is west of Arizona, but its longitude is around -115 to -114, which is more west. So no, Arizona makes sense. Therefore, the state is Arizona.
