Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 35.2083 latitude and -80.8303 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 35.2083 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -80.8303 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the eastern part, so maybe that's somewhere in the eastern US. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 35 degrees is around the middle of the US, like between Texas and North Carolina. Longitude -80 degrees is west of the Mississippi River, maybe in the southeastern states.

Wait, I can recall that Charlotte, North Carolina is a major city there. Let me check the coordinates for Charlotte. A quick search in my mind: Charlotte's coordinates are approximately 35.2271° N, 80.8437° W. The given coordinates are 35.2083 and -80.8303. That's pretty close to Charlotte. So that would be in North Carolina. 

But I should make sure there aren't other cities or places with similar coordinates. Maybe Asheville? No, Asheville is a bit further west, I think. Or maybe somewhere in South Carolina? But South Carolina's latitude is a bit lower, maybe around 34 degrees. So 35.2 is more likely North Carolina. 

Another way to check is to think about the time zone. The longitude -80.83 is in the Eastern Time Zone, which covers most of the eastern US, including North Carolina. Also, the elevation and surrounding areas—Charlotte is in the Piedmont region. 

I think it's safe to say that the coordinates point to North Carolina. Let me just confirm once more. If I convert those coordinates to a location, it's near Charlotte, which is in North Carolina. So the answer should be North Carolina.
