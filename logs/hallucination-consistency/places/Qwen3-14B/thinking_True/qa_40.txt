Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 40.8501 latitude and -73.8662 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 40.85 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -73.8662 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that New York City is around 40.7128째 N, 74.0060째 W. So the given coordinates are a bit north and east of NYC. Let me check the exact location. Maybe it's in New York State? But I should confirm.

Looking up the coordinates, 40.8501, -73.8662. Let me think about the areas around NYC. The longitude -73.8662 is west of NYC's longitude, which is -74.0060. So -73.8662 is actually east of NYC. Wait, no, because the longitude numbers get smaller as you go east. So -73.8662 is east of -74.0060. So that would be towards the east of NYC. 

But where exactly? Maybe in New York City itself? Let me check. The coordinates might be in the Bronx or Queens. Alternatively, maybe it's in New Jersey? Wait, New Jersey is to the west of NYC, so longitude would be more like -74.0 or so. But -73.8662 is east of that. So probably still in New York City. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of New York. Let me think. The latitude 40.85 is about 40 degrees north, which is in the northern part of New York State. The longitude -73.8662 is in the eastern part of the state. So combining those, it's likely in New York State. 

Wait, but I should make sure. Maybe using a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my knowledge. The coordinates are close to NYC, which is in New York State. So the answer should be New York.
