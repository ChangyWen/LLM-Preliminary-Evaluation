Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 36.783 latitude and -119.7939 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 36.783 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -119.7939 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying coordinates. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 36 degrees is around the area of California, Nevada, Arizona, and maybe New Mexico. Longitude -119 is west of the Prime Meridian. California's longitude ranges from about -124 to -117, so -119.79 would be in the southern part of California, maybe near the Central Valley or the southern coast.

Wait, but I should check if there's a major city or landmark there. Let me recall that the coordinates for Bakersfield, California are approximately 35.3075° N, 119.0195° W. Hmm, that's a bit north and east. Maybe the coordinates given are for a different city. Let me think about other cities. Maybe somewhere in the Inland Empire or the Central Valley. Alternatively, maybe it's near the border with Arizona or Nevada. 

Alternatively, I can think of the approximate regions. The longitude -119.79 is west of Los Angeles, which is around -118.24. So moving further west, that would be towards the Central Valley or maybe even near the Sierra Nevada mountains. Wait, but latitude 36.78 is about 36 degrees north, which is a bit south of San Francisco, which is around 37.7749° N. So maybe that's in the southern part of California, perhaps near the city of Bakersfield or even closer to the Mexican border. 

Alternatively, I can use a method to determine the state. If I can recall that the longitude -119 is in California, but I need to confirm. Let me think about the states that cross that longitude. California is there, but also Nevada and Arizona. However, at latitude 36.78, which is around 36 degrees north, Nevada's southern part is around 36 degrees, but the longitude for Nevada would be more like -116 to -114. So -119.79 is further west, which would be in California. 

Another way is to think about the approximate distance. From the Prime Meridian, -119.79 is about 119 degrees west. The continental US is between about 67° W (east coast) to 130° W (Alaska). So -119 is in the western part. California is between about 114° W to 124° W. So -119.79 is within that range. Therefore, the state is likely California. 

I think that's the answer. The coordinates are in California.
