Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 39.5497 latitude and -119.8483 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 39.5497 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -119.8483 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying latitudes and longitudes. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 39.5 is roughly around the area of California, Nevada, or maybe Oregon. But longitude -119.8 is pretty far west. Let me check some key points.

For example, Los Angeles is around 34°N latitude and 118°W longitude. So 39.5 is north of that, maybe up towards the central part of California. But longitude -119.8 is west of Los Angeles. Wait, maybe it's in Nevada? The longitude for Las Vegas is about 115°W, so -119.8 is further west. Hmm, that might be in California's Central Valley or maybe near the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Alternatively, I can think of major cities. Sacramento, the capital of California, is around 38.5°N, 121.4°W. So that's a bit south and east of the given coordinates. Maybe the coordinates are in the eastern part of California? Or perhaps in Nevada? Wait, the longitude -119.8 is between 119 and 120 degrees west. Let me check a map or think of specific places.

Another approach: using the latitude and longitude to determine the state. Latitude 39.5 is in the mid-latitudes, which is common for many states. The longitude -119.8 is in the western US. Let me think of states that span that longitude. California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, maybe. But Arizona is more around 112°W. So probably California or Nevada.

Wait, the longitude -119.8 is west of the Sierra Nevada range. If I recall, the Sierra Nevada is in eastern California, so maybe the coordinates are in the eastern part of California, near the Nevada border. Let me check approximate coordinates for places like Bakersfield or Fresno. Bakersfield is around 35.3°N, 119.0°W. So 39.5 is further north. Maybe somewhere in the Central Valley? But that's more around 36-37 degrees. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's in the mountains. The latitude 39.5 is about the same as Yosemite National Park, which is in California. Yosemite's coordinates are roughly 37.8°N, 120.5°W. Wait, that's a bit south and west. Maybe the coordinates given are in the northern part of California, near the Oregon border? But longitude -119.8 is still west of there.

Wait, I might be confusing the longitude. Let me think again. If the longitude is -119.8, that's 119.8 degrees west. So, for example, San Francisco is at about 37.7749° N, 122.4194° W. So that's further west. So -119.8 is east of San Francisco. So maybe somewhere in the Central Valley or the Sierra Nevada foothills.

Alternatively, maybe it's in Nevada. Let me check the coordinates for Reno, Nevada. Reno is around 39.5°N, 119.8°W. Wait, that's exactly the coordinates given! So the latitude is 39.5497, which is just a bit north of Reno's latitude, and longitude -119.8483 is slightly west of Reno's longitude. So that would place it in Nevada, near Reno. Therefore, the state is Nevada.
