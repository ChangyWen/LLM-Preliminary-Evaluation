Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 35.4676 latitude and -97.5136 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 35.4676 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -97.5136 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the central part, so maybe Oklahoma or Kansas? Let me think. Oklahoma's capital is Oklahoma City, which I think is around that area. Let me check approximate coordinates for Oklahoma City. I recall that Oklahoma City is roughly at 35.4676° N, 97.5136° W. Wait, that's exactly the coordinates given here. So that would place it in Oklahoma.

But wait, I should make sure. Maybe I should cross-verify. Let me think about other cities. For example, Tulsa is in Oklahoma, but its coordinates are a bit different. Let me confirm. If I look up Oklahoma City's coordinates, they are indeed approximately 35.4676° N, 97.5136° W. So that's the capital of Oklahoma. Therefore, the state should be Oklahoma. I don't think there's another major city in that exact location. Maybe parts of Texas or Kansas nearby, but the exact coordinates point to Oklahoma City, so the state is Oklahoma.
