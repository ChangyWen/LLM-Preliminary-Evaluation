Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 38.8674 latitude and -104.7605 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out how to determine the state from these coordinates.

I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location on a map. Latitude 38.8674 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -104.7605 is in the western hemisphere. The negative longitude means it's west of the Prime Meridian. 

Now, I should think about the approximate regions these coordinates might fall into. Latitude 38 degrees is roughly in the central United States. For example, cities like Kansas City or Denver are around that latitude. Longitude -104 is west of the Mississippi River, so maybe in the central or western part of the US.

I can recall that Colorado's longitude ranges are around -102 to -109, so -104.76 would be within Colorado. Let me check if that's accurate. Also, the latitude 38.8674 is about 38 degrees north, which is similar to Denver's latitude, which is around 39.7 degrees, but maybe a bit lower. Wait, maybe it's in Kansas? Kansas is around 38-39 degrees latitude. But longitude -104 is more towards the west. Let me think again.

Wait, Colorado's western part is around -105 longitude, so -104.76 is just east of that. Maybe it's in Colorado. Alternatively, maybe it's in Kansas or Nebraska. Let me try to visualize a map. If I take a map of the central US, latitude 38.8 is about the same as the southern part of Colorado or northern Kansas. But longitude -104.76 is west of the Colorado River, so maybe Colorado. 

Alternatively, I can use a method to check. For example, I know that the city of Pueblo, Colorado is at approximately 38.28 degrees latitude and -104.6 degrees longitude. The given coordinates are 38.8674 and -104.7605, which is a bit north and west of Pueblo. That would still be in Colorado. 

Another way is to think about major cities. Denver is at about 39.7 degrees latitude and -104.99 longitude. The given coordinates are a bit south and east of Denver. So that would still be in Colorado. 

I think the answer is Colorado. But to be sure, maybe I should cross-verify. If I use an online tool or a map, but since I can't access that, I have to rely on my knowledge. Colorado spans from about 37 to 41 degrees latitude and -109 to -102 longitude. The given longitude is -104.76, which is within that range. The latitude 38.86 is also within Colorado's range. So yes, the state is Colorado.
