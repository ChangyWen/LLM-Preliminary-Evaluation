Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 32.8313 latitude and -117.1222 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 32.8313 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -117.1222 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying coordinates. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 32 degrees north is somewhere around the southern part of the US, maybe Texas or California? Wait, but longitude -117 is west of the prime meridian. Let me recall that San Diego is in California, and I think its coordinates are around 32.7 degrees north and -117.2 degrees west. So the given coordinates are very close to San Diego. 

San Diego is in California, so the state would be California. Let me double-check. Maybe I can think of other cities. For example, Los Angeles is at about 34 degrees north, which is a bit north of 32.8. So 32.8 is more southern. San Diego is in Southern California. The longitude -117.12 is just a bit east of San Diego's longitude, which is around -117.15. So that's very close. 

I think that's right. The coordinates are in San Diego, California. Therefore, the state is California.
