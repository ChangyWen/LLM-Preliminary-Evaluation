Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 29.4632 latitude and -98.5238 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 29.4632 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -98.5238 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the central and southern regions. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 30 degrees is around the area of Texas, Louisiana, and maybe parts of Oklahoma. Longitude -98 degrees is west of the Mississippi River. Texas is a big state that spans a lot of longitudes. 

Wait, San Antonio is in Texas, and I think its coordinates are around 29.4243째 N, 98.4936째 W. The given coordinates here are 29.4632 and -98.5238, which are very close to San Antonio. So that would place it in Texas. 

But I should double-check. Maybe using a map or a geographical database. Alternatively, I can recall that the central part of Texas is around those coordinates. Also, the longitude -98.5 is west of Dallas, which is in Texas. So combining both latitude and longitude, it's definitely within Texas. 

I don't think there's another state that has that specific latitude and longitude. Maybe Oklahoma or New Mexico, but those are further north or south? Let me think. Oklahoma is more around 35 degrees latitude, so that's higher. New Mexico is more around 34-35 degrees, so maybe a bit north. So 29 degrees is more southern Texas. 

Yes, I'm pretty confident it's Texas. The coordinates are in San Antonio, Texas. So the answer should be Texas.
