Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 39.762 latitude and -104.8758 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 39.762 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -104.8758 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying coordinates. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 40 degrees is around the area of cities like Denver, Colorado, or maybe somewhere in the Midwest. Wait, Denver's coordinates are approximately 39.7398° N, 104.9903° W. The given longitude here is -104.8758, which is slightly east of Denver's longitude. So maybe it's near Denver but a bit to the east?

Alternatively, maybe it's in Kansas or Nebraska? But those states are a bit further north or south. Let me check. Colorado's latitude ranges from about 37°N to 41°N, so 39.76 is within that range. The longitude of -104.8758 is west of the Mississippi River, which is in the central part of the US. Colorado is west of the Mississippi, so that makes sense. 

Another way to think about it: the longitude -104.8758 is equivalent to 104.8758 degrees west. If I recall, the Rocky Mountains are in Colorado, and Denver is a major city there. Since the coordinates are close to Denver's, it's likely in Colorado. 

I can also think about other cities. For example, Pueblo, Colorado is at around 38.27°N, 104.62°W, which is a bit south and east. But the given latitude is 39.76, which is north of Denver. Maybe it's in the northern part of Colorado. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Nebraska? But Nebraska's longitude is more around 96 to 103 degrees west. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, Nebraska is more central. Let me confirm. The longitude of -104.8758 is about 104.88 degrees west. Colorado is west of the 100th meridian, so that's correct. 

Another check: using an online map or a coordinate converter. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on memory. The coordinates given are very close to Denver's, which is in Colorado. Therefore, the state is likely Colorado. 

I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure there's no other state with similar coordinates. For example, Wyoming is to the north of Colorado, but its latitude is higher, around 41-45 degrees. So 39.76 is a bit south of that. Kansas is south of Colorado, but longitude there is more around 95-100 degrees west. So no, the longitude here is more west, so it's definitely Colorado. 

Yes, I'm pretty confident the answer is Colorado.
