Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 42.6664 latitude and -73.7987 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 42.6664 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -73.7987 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the northern latitudes. Let me think about the longitude. -73.7987 is approximately 73.8 degrees west. I know that New York City is around 74 degrees west longitude, so this might be near NYC. But wait, the latitude is 42.6664. Let me check the approximate coordinates of NYC. NYC is roughly 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W. So the given latitude here is higher (42.6664 vs 40.7128), which would be further north. 

So maybe this is upstate New York? Let me think. Albany, the capital of New York, is around 42.6526° N, 73.7562° W. That's very close to the given coordinates. The latitude here is 42.6664, which is just a bit north of Albany's latitude. The longitude is -73.7987, which is slightly west of Albany's longitude. So this point is probably near Albany, New York. 

Wait, but I should confirm. Let me check if there's any other city or place in that area. Maybe it's in New York State. Let me also consider other states. For example, Vermont is to the north of New York, but its longitude would be more like 72 degrees west. So 73.8 is more west, which is still within New York. 

Another way to check is to use a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. Albany is in New York State, and the coordinates given are very close to Albany's coordinates. Therefore, the state is likely New York.
