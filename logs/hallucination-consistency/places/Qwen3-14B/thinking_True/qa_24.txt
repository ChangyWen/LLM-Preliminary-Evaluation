Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 45.5371 latitude and -122.65 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 45.5371 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -122.65 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying coordinates. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 45 degrees is around the middle of the country. For example, cities like Portland, Oregon are in that area. Wait, Portland's coordinates are roughly 45.5234° N, 122.6750° W. The given longitude here is -122.65, which is very close to Portland's longitude. The latitude given is 45.5371, which is slightly north of Portland's 45.5234. 

So, that would still be in Oregon. But I should double-check. Maybe there's another city or area nearby. Let me think about other states. Washington state is to the north of Oregon, but their latitudes would be a bit higher, maybe around 47-49 degrees. So 45.5 is more in the lower part of Oregon. 

Also, considering the longitude, -122.65 is west of the 123rd meridian, which is in Oregon. So that's definitely within Oregon's borders. I don't think there's another state that's close to that specific coordinate. Maybe check if there's a major city or landmark there. The coordinates given are very close to Portland, Oregon. 

Another way to confirm is to think about the time zone. Oregon is in the Pacific Time Zone, which is UTC-8 or UTC-7. The longitude of -122.65 would be in that time zone. Also, the elevation and surrounding geography—Portland is near the Willamette River and the Cascade Mountains. 

I think I'm pretty confident that this is in Oregon. But to be thorough, maybe check if there's any other state that could have similar coordinates. For example, northern California is around 39-42 degrees latitude, so that's too low. Washington is higher, as mentioned. So yes, Oregon is the correct state.
