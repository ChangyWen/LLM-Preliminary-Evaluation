Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 41.2627 latitude and -96.0529 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out how to determine the state from these coordinates.

I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location on a map. Latitude 41.2627 is in the northern hemisphere since it's positive. The longitude is -96.0529, which is west of the Prime Meridian. Now, I need to figure out which U.S. state this falls into.

I know that the United States spans a wide range of latitudes and longitudes. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 41 degrees is roughly around the middle of the country. For example, cities like Chicago are around 41.8 degrees north, which is a bit north of 41.26. Longitude -96 is west of the Mississippi River. The Mississippi River is around longitude -90, so -96 is further west. 

States west of the Mississippi include Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, etc. Let me think about the central part of the U.S. Maybe Kansas? Or Nebraska? Wait, I should check approximate coordinates for some cities. For example, Topeka, Kansas is around 39.05 degrees north, which is a bit south. Omaha, Nebraska is around 41.25 degrees north and -95.93 degrees west. That's very close to the given coordinates. The longitude here is -96.05, which is slightly west of Omaha. 

Another city in Nebraska is Lincoln, which is at about 40.8 degrees north, so that's a bit south. Maybe the coordinates are in Nebraska. Alternatively, could it be in Kansas? Let me check. Wichita, Kansas is around 37.7 degrees north, which is too far south. So maybe Nebraska. 

Alternatively, I can think of the approximate boundaries. Nebraska's latitude ranges from about 40 degrees north to 43 degrees north. The longitude ranges from around -103 degrees west to -96 degrees west. So -96.05 is within Nebraska's longitude range. 

Another way is to use an online tool or a map, but since I can't access that, I have to rely on memory. I think the coordinates given are in Nebraska. So the answer should be Nebraska.
