Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 39.3051 latitude and -76.6144 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 39.3051 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -76.6144 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying latitudes and longitudes. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 39 degrees is around the middle of the US, maybe somewhere between the northern states and the southern ones. For longitude, -76 degrees west is in the eastern part of the country. 

Wait, the longitude is -76.6144, which is about 76.6 degrees west. Let me recall some major cities. For example, Washington, D.C. is at around 38.9072° N, 77.0369° W. So that's a bit further west. The given longitude here is -76.6144, which is east of Washington, D.C. Maybe somewhere in Maryland or Virginia?

Maryland's longitude ranges roughly from about 75° W to 79° W, so -76.6 is within that range. Latitude 39.3 is a bit north of Washington, D.C. Let me check if there's a city there. Maybe Baltimore? Baltimore's coordinates are approximately 39.2990° N, 76.6122° W. Wait, that's very close to the given coordinates. So that would be Baltimore, Maryland. 

Therefore, the state should be Maryland. Let me confirm. If I look up the coordinates 39.3051, -76.6144, it's near Baltimore, which is in Maryland. So the answer is Maryland.
