Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 33.7977 latitude and -118.167 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 33.7977 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -118.167 is west of the Prime Meridian. 

I remember that Los Angeles is in California, and I think its coordinates are around 34°N, 118°W. Let me check if 33.7977 is close to that. 33.7977 is approximately 33°47'51"N, which is a bit south of Los Angeles. But maybe it's still in California. The longitude -118.167 is about 118°10'W, which is west of Los Angeles. 

Wait, maybe it's in the area of downtown Los Angeles? Let me think. The exact coordinates for Los Angeles are roughly 34.0522° N, 118.2437° W. The given latitude here is 33.7977, which is a bit further south. Maybe it's in the southern part of California, like near Long Beach or somewhere else. 

Alternatively, I can think of major cities in California. San Diego is around 32.715° N, 117.161° W. So the longitude here is -118.167, which is more west than San Diego. So between San Diego and Los Angeles. Maybe it's in Orange County or somewhere in the Inland Empire? 

Wait, another approach: using the coordinates, I can check if they fall within California's boundaries. California's latitude ranges from about 32°N to 42°N, and longitude from 114°W to 125°W. The given coordinates are within that range. So it's definitely in California. 

But to be precise, maybe the user wants the exact city or area. However, the question is just about the state. So regardless of the exact location within California, the answer is California. I think that's it. Let me confirm once more. Yes, 33.7977° N, 118.167° W is in Los Angeles County, California. So the state is California.
