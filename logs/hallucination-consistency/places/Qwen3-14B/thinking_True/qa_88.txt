Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 33.4015 latitude and -111.7178 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 33.4015 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -111.7178 is in the western hemisphere since it's negative. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying coordinates. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 33 degrees is around the area of the southern United States, like Texas, Oklahoma, or maybe even parts of New Mexico. But longitude -111 degrees west... Hmm, that's pretty far west. Let me recall the longitudes of some states. Arizona is around that longitude range. For example, Phoenix, Arizona, is at about 33.4484° N, 112.0740° W. Wait, the longitude here is -111.7178, which is east of Phoenix. So maybe it's in eastern Arizona?

Alternatively, maybe it's in New Mexico? Let me check. The longitude for Albuquerque, New Mexico, is around 106.6189° W, which is further east. Wait, no, that's more east than -111.7. Wait, no, longitude numbers get more negative as you go west. So -111.7 is further west than -106.6. So Arizona is more west. Let me think of other cities. Tucson, Arizona is at about 32.1232° N, 110.8895° W. That's longitude -110.89, which is east of -111.7. So the given longitude is more west than Tucson. Maybe somewhere in western Arizona?

Wait, but latitude 33.4 is a bit north of Tucson. Let me check if there's a major city there. Maybe Yuma, Arizona? Yuma's coordinates are approximately 32.6697° N, 114.5867° W. That's more south and further west. Hmm. Maybe it's not a major city. Let me think of the state boundaries. Arizona's longitude ranges from about -114° W to -109° W. So -111.7 is within that range. So the coordinates are in Arizona. 

Alternatively, could it be in Nevada? Nevada's longitude is more around -115° to -114°, so maybe not. New Mexico is more east. So I think the answer is Arizona. Let me confirm with a quick check. If I look up the coordinates 33.4015, -111.7178, that's near the city of Phoenix? Wait, Phoenix is at 33.4484° N, 112.0740° W. The longitude here is -111.7178, which is east of Phoenix. So maybe it's in the eastern part of Arizona, perhaps near the border with New Mexico. 

Another way to check is to use a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I'll rely on my knowledge. Arizona's eastern border is with New Mexico, and the coordinates given are in the southern part of Arizona. So the state is Arizona.
