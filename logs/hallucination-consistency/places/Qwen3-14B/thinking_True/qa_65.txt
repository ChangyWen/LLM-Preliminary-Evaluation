Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 40.5961 latitude and -75.4756 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 40.5961 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -75.4756 is in the western hemisphere. 

I know that the United States has a lot of states, but the longitude of -75.4756 is pretty far west. Let me think. The prime meridian is 0, and moving west, the longitude numbers increase. So -75 degrees west is somewhere in the eastern part of the US. Wait, but the US spans from about -125 degrees west (Alaska) to around -66 degrees west (Maine). So -75 is in the eastern part, maybe Pennsylvania or New Jersey?

Wait, Philadelphia is at around 39.9526° N, 75.1652° W. The given longitude here is -75.4756, which is more west than Philadelphia. So maybe further west in Pennsylvania? Or maybe New Jersey? Wait, New Jersey's longitude is around -74.2 to -75.0. So -75.4756 is more west than that. Let me check. Maybe it's in Pennsylvania. Let me think about cities. Harrisburg is the capital of Pennsylvania, and its coordinates are approximately 40.2697° N, 76.8727° W. That's more west than the given longitude. Wait, the given longitude is -75.4756, which is 75.4756 degrees west. So that's between Philadelphia (75.1652) and Harrisburg (76.8727). So maybe somewhere in eastern Pennsylvania?

Alternatively, maybe it's in New Jersey? But New Jersey's westernmost point is around -74.2. So -75.4756 is further west. So probably Pennsylvania. Let me check some other cities. Maybe Allentown, Pennsylvania? Its coordinates are around 40.6039° N, 75.3971° W. That's very close to the given latitude of 40.5961 and longitude of -75.4756. Wait, the longitude here is -75.4756, which is 75.4756 west. Allentown's longitude is 75.3971 west, which is slightly east. So maybe a bit further west from Allentown. Maybe somewhere in Lehigh County or Carbon County in Pennsylvania?

Alternatively, maybe it's near the Delaware River? Let me think. The coordinates 40.5961, -75.4756. Let me use a map. If I can't visualize, maybe I can recall that the state line between Pennsylvania and New Jersey is along the Delaware River. But the longitude here is more west than New Jersey. So it's definitely in Pennsylvania. So the answer should be Pennsylvania.
