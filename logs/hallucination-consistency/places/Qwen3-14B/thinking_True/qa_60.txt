Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 35.1054 latitude and -106.6465 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 35.1054 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -106.6465 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the western part, especially around the 100th meridian. Let me think about the longitude. -106.6465 is approximately 106.65 degrees west. That's in the central part of the US, maybe New Mexico or Arizona? 

Wait, New Mexico's longitude ranges are roughly between 103° W to 109° W. So -106.65 would be within that range. Let me check the latitude. 35.1054 degrees north. New Mexico's latitude ranges from about 31° N to 37° N. So 35 degrees north is right in the middle of that. 

I think that area might be near Albuquerque, New Mexico. Let me confirm. Albuquerque's coordinates are approximately 35.1054° N, 106.6465° W. Yes, that's exactly the coordinates given. So the state would be New Mexico. 

I should double-check to make sure there aren't any other states with similar coordinates. Arizona is to the west of New Mexico, but its longitude would be more like -112°, which is further west. Texas is to the south, but its latitude is lower, around 31° N to 37° N, but longitude would be more east, like -99° to -103°. So New Mexico fits here. 

Therefore, the answer should be New Mexico.
