Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 36.7335 latitude and -76.0435 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 36.7335 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -76.0435 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the eastern part, so maybe that's somewhere in the eastern US. Let me think about the approximate locations. The longitude -76 is pretty close to the eastern coast. For example, cities like Richmond, Virginia, or maybe even further east. Wait, Virginia's longitude is around -76.3, so maybe that's near there. But the latitude 36.7 is a bit north. Let me check some major cities.

Richmond, Virginia is at about 37.54° N, 77.46° W. Hmm, that's a bit north and west of the given coordinates. Maybe it's further south. Let me think about North Carolina. Raleigh is around 35.78° N, 78.67° W. That's south and west. Wait, the latitude here is 36.7, which is between 35.78 and 37.54. So maybe somewhere in central Virginia or North Carolina?

Alternatively, maybe it's in Tennessee? Let me check. Nashville is at 36.16° N, 86.78° W. That's west of the given longitude. So the longitude -76 is more east. Maybe it's in Virginia. Let me check the coordinates again. 36.7335° N, 76.0435° W. 

Wait, I can use a map or a geographical tool. But since I can't access external resources, I need to recall. The longitude -76 is near the eastern part of Virginia. Let me think about the city of Roanoke, Virginia. Roanoke is at approximately 37.27° N, 79.93° W. Still west. Maybe the coordinates are in the eastern part of Virginia, near the border with North Carolina. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of West Virginia? But West Virginia is more west. Let me think. The longitude -76 is east of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Maybe it's in the eastern part of Virginia. Let me check approximate coordinates. If I take 36.73° N and -76.04° W, that's probably in Virginia. For example, the city of Danville, Virginia is at around 37.33° N, 78.85° W. Still west. Wait, maybe it's in the coastal area. Let me think about the Hampton Roads area. Norfolk is at 36.85° N, 76.29° W. That's very close to the given coordinates. So 36.73° N is a bit south of Norfolk, and longitude -76.04 is a bit east of Norfolk's -76.29. So maybe it's in Virginia Beach or near there. 

Virginia Beach is at around 36.88° N, 76.01° W. That's very close to the given coordinates. So the latitude 36.73 is a bit south of that, and longitude -76.04 is just a bit west of Virginia Beach's longitude. So that would place it in Virginia, near the coast. Therefore, the state is Virginia.
