Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 41.2279 latitude and -111.9682 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out how to determine the state from these coordinates.

I know that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location on a map. Latitude 41.2279 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -111.9682 is in the western hemisphere. The negative longitude means it's west of the Prime Meridian. 

Now, I should think about the approximate regions these coordinates might fall into. Latitude 41 degrees is roughly in the middle of the United States, maybe around the central part. Longitude -112 degrees west is quite far west. Let me recall the states in the western U.S. 

Looking at the longitude, -111.9682 is close to -112, which is near the area of Utah, Arizona, or Nevada. Let me check the approximate longitudes of these states. Utah's longitude ranges are roughly between -114 and -109, so -112 would be in the eastern part of Utah. Alternatively, Arizona's longitude is around -112 to -109, so maybe that's where it is. Wait, but latitude 41 degrees is a bit north. Let me think about the cities. 

For example, Salt Lake City, Utah, is at around 40.7608° N, 111.8910° W. That's pretty close to the given coordinates. The given latitude is 41.2279, which is a bit north of Salt Lake City, and longitude -111.9682 is slightly west of Salt Lake City's longitude. So that might be in Utah. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Colorado? Colorado's longitude is around -105 to -102, so that's east of Utah. So probably not Colorado. Nevada's longitude is around -116 to -114, which is further west. So maybe Utah is the correct state here. 

I can also use an online tool or a map to confirm, but since I can't access external resources, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge. Another way is to think about major cities. For example, Provo, Utah, is at about 40.2477° N, 111.6533° W. The given coordinates are a bit north and west of that. Maybe it's near the border with Idaho? But Idaho's longitude is around -117 to -111, so maybe the western part of Idaho? Wait, but latitude 41 is more towards the southern part of Idaho. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Wyoming? Wyoming's longitude is around -104 to -109, so that's east of the given longitude. So probably not. 

So, considering all that, the coordinates are likely in Utah. Therefore, the state is Utah.
