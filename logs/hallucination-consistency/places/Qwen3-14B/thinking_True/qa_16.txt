Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 44.9635 latitude and -93.2678 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 44.9635 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -93.2678 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the central part, like Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, maybe even parts of North Dakota or South Dakota. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 44.96 is around the same as Minneapolis, Minnesota, which I know is approximately 44.9772째 N, 93.2669째 W. Wait, that's very close to the given coordinates. The longitude here is -93.2678, which is just a bit west of Minneapolis. 

So, if Minneapolis is at roughly those coordinates, then the location must be in Minnesota. Let me double-check. Maybe I can recall that the Twin Cities area (Minneapolis and St. Paul) are in Minnesota. The coordinates given are very close to Minneapolis, so the state should be Minnesota. I don't think there's another major city in that area with those coordinates. Let me confirm by thinking about other states. For example, Iowa is a bit to the south, and Wisconsin is to the east. So yes, Minnesota makes sense here. I think that's the correct answer.
