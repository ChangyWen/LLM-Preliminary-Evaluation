Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 43.168 latitude and -77.6162 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 43.168 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -77.6162 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the northern latitudes. Let me think about the longitude first. -77.6162 is approximately 77.6 degrees west. The prime meridian is 0, so moving west, that's pretty far. Let me recall some major cities. For example, New York City is around 74 degrees west, so 77.6 is further west. Maybe somewhere in Pennsylvania or Ohio? Wait, Ohio is around 83 degrees west, so that's too far. Pennsylvania's longitude is more like 75-78 degrees west. So maybe Pennsylvania?

Now the latitude 43.168. Let me think. The latitude of New York City is about 40.7 degrees north. So 43 degrees is a bit further north. That would be in the northern part of Pennsylvania, maybe near the Ohio border? Or perhaps in New York state? Wait, New York's northern part is around 43 degrees. For example, Buffalo is around 42.89 degrees north, so 43.168 is a bit north of that. Maybe near the Canadian border? But that's in New York. However, the longitude is -77.6, which is west of NYC. Let me check some coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe it's in Ohio? Wait, Ohio's latitude ranges from about 38 to 42 degrees north. So 43 degrees is north of that. So maybe Pennsylvania? Let me think about Pennsylvania's coordinates. The state's latitude ranges from about 39 to 42 degrees north, but wait, that doesn't reach 43. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Wait, maybe I should check a map or use a tool. But since I can't do that, I need to think of cities. 

Cleveland, Ohio is around 41.5 degrees north. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is around 40.4 degrees north. So 43 degrees is higher. Maybe it's in New York state? Let me think. The northern part of New York state, like near the Canadian border, has latitudes around 45 degrees. So 43.168 is a bit south of that. Maybe in the Finger Lakes region? For example, Ithaca, NY is around 42.4 degrees north. So 43.168 is a bit north of that. 

Wait, maybe it's in Pennsylvania's northern part? But earlier I thought Pennsylvania's latitude doesn't go that high. Let me check again. Pennsylvania's northernmost point is near 42 degrees north. So 43.168 would be north of that. So maybe it's in New York state. Let me think about the longitude again. -77.6 is west of NYC. So if it's in New York, maybe near the Pennsylvania border? For example, Binghamton, NY is around 42.1 degrees north and 75.9 degrees west. That's east of our longitude. Wait, our longitude is -77.6, which is further west. So maybe near the western part of New York state? 

Wait, the coordinates 43.168, -77.6162. Let me think of a city. Maybe it's near Syracuse, NY? Syracuse is around 43.07 degrees north and 76.14 degrees west. So that's a bit east of our longitude. Our longitude is -77.6, which is further west. So maybe a bit west of Syracuse. But that's still in New York state. Alternatively, maybe it's in Ohio? Wait, Ohio's longitude is more like 80-83 degrees west. So -77.6 is east of Ohio. So that's not it. 

Wait, maybe it's in Pennsylvania? If the latitude is 43.168, which is north of Pennsylvania's typical range, but maybe the western part of Pennsylvania? Let me think. Pittsburgh is at 40.4, so moving north, maybe somewhere near the Ohio border? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's in New York state, near the Pennsylvania border. 

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coordinates are in the vicinity of a specific city. Let me try to approximate. If I take 43.168 latitude and -77.6162 longitude, converting that to a location. Let me think of the approximate area. The longitude -77.6 is about 77.6 degrees west. Let me compare with known cities. 

For example, Rochester, NY is at 43.1 degrees north and 77.6 degrees west. Wait, that's very close! So Rochester, New York is at approximately 43.1째 N, 77.6째 W. So the given coordinates are very close to Rochester. Therefore, the state would be New York. 

So the answer is New York.
