Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 42.9619 latitude and -85.6562 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out how to determine the state from these coordinates.

I know that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location on a map. Latitude 42.9619 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -85.6562 is in the western hemisphere. The negative longitude means it's west of the Prime Meridian. 

I remember that the United States has a range of latitudes and longitudes. For example, states like Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois are in the midwestern part of the US. Let me think about the approximate coordinates. 

Latitude 42 degrees is roughly around the area of cities like Chicago, which is in Illinois. But I need to check the longitude. Chicago's longitude is around -87.6, which is more west than -85.6562. So maybe the location is east of Chicago. 

Looking at the longitude of -85.6562, that's closer to the longitude of cities like Indianapolis, Indiana, which is around -86.1, but that's still a bit west. Wait, maybe it's in Michigan? Detroit is at around 42.3314 latitude and -83.0458 longitude. That's more east than -85.6562. Hmm, maybe it's in Ohio? Columbus, Ohio is at about 39.9612 latitude and -82.9988 longitude. That's south and east. 

Wait, maybe I should use a map or a geographical tool. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think about the approximate regions. The latitude 42.96 is in the northern part of the US, maybe in the Great Lakes region. The longitude -85.6562 is west of the 85th meridian. 

Looking at the states, Indiana is between longitude 84.5 and 87.5, roughly. So -85.6562 would be in Indiana. Let me check if that's correct. For example, Indianapolis is at -86.1, so -85.6562 is east of that. Maybe it's in the eastern part of Indiana. Alternatively, could it be in Ohio? Ohio's western border is around longitude 82.5, so -85.6562 is west of Ohio. Wait, no, Ohio is east of Indiana. Wait, no, longitude decreases as you go west. So -85.6562 is west of -85, which is more west than -85. So maybe it's in Indiana. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Michigan's lower peninsula. But Michigan's longitude ranges from around -83 to -87. So -85.6562 is within that range. But latitude 42.96 is in the northern part of Michigan. However, the exact location might be in a specific city. 

Wait, I think the coordinates might be for a place like Fort Wayne, Indiana. Let me recall: Fort Wayne's coordinates are approximately 41.0975° N, 85.2363° W. That's latitude 41.0975, which is lower than 42.96. So maybe not. 

Another approach: The latitude 42.96 is about 43 degrees north, which is similar to cities like Milwaukee, Wisconsin (43.0705° N, 87.9936° W) but that's further west. Maybe it's in the northern part of Indiana. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Ohio. Let me think of cities in Ohio with that latitude. Columbus is at 39.96, which is too low. Cleveland is at 41.4993° N, 81.6944° W. Still too low. Maybe a city in northern Ohio? 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of the approximate area. Latitude 42.96 is about 43 degrees north, which is in the northern part of the US. Longitude -85.6562 is about 85.66 degrees west. 

Looking at a map, the 42nd parallel north runs through several states. In the US, it passes through states like Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. The longitude of -85.6562 is west of the 85th meridian. 

If I consider that the longitude -85.6562 is west of the 85th meridian, which is in the central part of the US. So, in Indiana, the longitude ranges from about -87.5 to -84.5. So -85.6562 is within that range. Therefore, the coordinates are likely in Indiana. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Michigan's lower peninsula. But Michigan's latitude ranges from about 41 to 46 degrees north. So 42.96 is within that. However, the longitude of -85.6562 is more west than the eastern part of Michigan. 

Wait, the easternmost point of Michigan is around -82.5, so -85.6562 is further west, which would be in the lower peninsula's western part. But that's still within Michigan. However, I need to check if that longitude is in Michigan or Indiana. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Ohio. But Ohio's longitude is more east. Wait, no, Ohio is east of Indiana. So if the longitude is -85.6562, which is west of -85, that would be west of the 85th meridian. Indiana is west of Ohio. So if the longitude is -85.6562, that's west of the 85th meridian, which would be in Indiana. 

Therefore, I think the coordinates are in Indiana. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should check if there's a major city there. For example, South Bend, Indiana is at 41.6836° N, 86.2463° W. That's more west. So maybe the coordinates are in the eastern part of Indiana. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the city of Elkhart, Indiana, which is at 41.6667° N, 85.8333° W. That's latitude 41.67, which is lower than 42.96. So maybe not. 

Wait, perhaps the coordinates are in the northern part of Indiana. Let me think of a city with latitude around 42.96. Maybe it's in the northern part of the state. For example, the city of Gary, Indiana is at 41.5667° N, 87.3936° W. Still too low. 

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to think of the exact coordinates. 42.9619° N, 85.6562° W. If I convert that to a map, maybe it's near the city of Kalamazoo, Michigan? Wait, Kalamazoo is at 42.2966° N, 85.5933° W. That's latitude 42.2966, which is lower than 42.96. So the given latitude is higher. 

If I go north from Kalamazoo, maybe it's in the northern part of Michigan. For example, Traverse City is at 44.7363° N, 85.8533° W. That's latitude 44.7, which is higher than 42.96. So the given latitude is between Traverse City and Kalamazoo. 

Wait, maybe it's in the city of Muskegon, Michigan. Muskegon is at 42.8936° N, 86.1333° W. That's latitude 42.89, which is very close to 42.96. The longitude is 86.13, which is more west than -85.6562. So the given longitude is east of Muskegon. 

So if Muskegon is at 86.13° W, then -85.6562 is east of that. So maybe the location is in the eastern part of Michigan, near the border with Indiana. 

Wait, the longitude -85.6562 is 85.6562 degrees west. So that's east of the 85th meridian. The 85th meridian runs through the central part of the US. 

If I consider that, the coordinates 42.9619° N, 85.6562° W would be in the area of the state of Indiana or Michigan. But given that the longitude is -85.6562, which is east of the 85th meridian, and the latitude is around 43 degrees north, which is in the northern part of Indiana. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Ohio. But Ohio's longitude is more east. Wait, no, Ohio is east of Indiana. So if the longitude is -85.6562, which is west of the 85th meridian, that would be west of Ohio. So it's more likely Indiana. 

I think I'm going to go with Indiana as the state for these coordinates. But I'm not entirely certain. However, based on the latitude and longitude ranges, Indiana seems to be the most probable answer.
