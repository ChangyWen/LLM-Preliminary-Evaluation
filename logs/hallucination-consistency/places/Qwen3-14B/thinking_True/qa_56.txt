Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 32.1541 latitude and -110.8787 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out how to determine the state from these coordinates.

I know that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location on a map. Latitude 32.1541 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -110.8787 is in the western hemisphere. The negative longitude means it's west of the Prime Meridian. 

Now, I should think about the approximate regions these coordinates might fall into. Latitude 32 degrees is roughly in the southern part of the United States, maybe around Arizona, New Mexico, or Texas. Longitude -110 degrees west is also in the southwestern U.S. Let me recall the approximate longitudes of states. Arizona is around -112 to -109 degrees west, so -110.8787 would be within Arizona's longitude range. 

But wait, maybe I should check if there's a specific city or landmark there. Let me think. Coordinates 32.1541, -110.8787... I'm not sure of the exact location, but maybe it's near a major city. For example, Tucson, Arizona is around 32.1161° N, 110.9167° W. The given longitude here is -110.8787, which is slightly east of Tucson's longitude. So that would be a bit east of Tucson, still in Arizona. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in New Mexico? New Mexico's longitude ranges are more around -106 to -103 degrees west, so -110 is further west, which would be outside of New Mexico. So that's probably not New Mexico. 

Another way is to use an online tool or a map, but since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. Arizona spans from about 31°N to 37°N latitude and 109°W to 114°W longitude. The given latitude of 32.15°N is within that range, and the longitude of -110.8787 is also within Arizona's longitude range. 

Therefore, the coordinates are likely in Arizona. I should confirm if there are any other states that might overlap. For example, parts of California are west of Arizona, but their longitudes are more like -120°W, which is further west. So no, that's not it. 

So, putting it all together, the state is Arizona.
