Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 43.0822 latitude and -89.393 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 43.0822 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -89.393 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying latitudes and longitudes. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 43 degrees north is somewhere around the middle of the US. For example, cities like Chicago are around 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W. But the longitude here is -89.393, which is further west than Chicago. 

Wait, maybe it's in Wisconsin? I know that Wisconsin's latitude ranges from about 42 to 47 degrees north, and longitude from around 87 to 90 degrees west. So -89.393 would be within that range. Let me check some major cities in Wisconsin. Milwaukee is at approximately 43.0711° N, 87.9936° W. Hmm, that's a bit east of the given longitude. But the longitude here is -89.393, which is more west. 

Wait, maybe it's near the border with Illinois? Or perhaps it's in the western part of Wisconsin. Let me think of another city. Madison, the capital of Wisconsin, is at 43.0731° N, 89.4007° W. Oh! That's very close to the given coordinates. The latitude is 43.0731, which is almost 43.0822, and the longitude is 89.4007, which is just slightly east of -89.393. So the coordinates given are very near Madison, Wisconsin. 

Therefore, the state should be Wisconsin. Let me confirm once more. If I look up the coordinates 43.0822, -89.393, it's in the vicinity of Madison, which is in Wisconsin. So the answer is Wisconsin.
