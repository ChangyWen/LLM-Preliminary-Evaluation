Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 33.7628 latitude and -84.422 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 33.7628 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -84.422 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying coordinates. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 33 degrees is around the southern part of the US, like Texas, Oklahoma, or maybe even parts of the Southeast. But longitude -84 is pretty far west. Wait, the longitude is negative, which means it's west of the Prime Meridian. So -84 degrees west would be in the central or eastern part of the US, maybe around the Mississippi River area?

Wait, maybe I should think of major cities. Atlanta, Georgia is known to be around 33.7 degrees latitude and -84.4 degrees longitude. Let me check that. Yes, Atlanta's coordinates are approximately 33.7488째 N, 84.3877째 W. The given coordinates are 33.7628 and -84.422, which are very close to Atlanta. So that would place it in Georgia. 

But just to be sure, maybe there's another city or area with similar coordinates. Let me think. Maybe parts of Alabama or Tennessee? But those states are a bit further north or south? Wait, Georgia's latitude ranges from about 30 to 35 degrees north, so 33.7 is within that range. The longitude of -84.4 is in the central part of Georgia. 

Another way to confirm is to use a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. I'm pretty confident that those coordinates are in Atlanta, Georgia. Therefore, the state is Georgia.
