Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 39.7805 latitude and -84.2003 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 39.7805 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -84.2003 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying coordinates. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 40 degrees is around the area of cities like Chicago, which is in Illinois, but that's more like 41.8781 latitude. Maybe this is a bit south of that. 

Looking at longitude -84.2, that's west of the Mississippi River. Cities like Cincinnati, Ohio are around that longitude. Cincinnati's coordinates are approximately 39.1031° N, 84.5120° W. Wait, the given longitude here is -84.2003, which is slightly east of Cincinnati. Maybe it's near Louisville, Kentucky? Let me check. Louisville's coordinates are around 38.2521° N, 85.7585° W. Hmm, that's a bit further west. 

Wait, maybe it's in Indiana? Indianapolis is at about 39.7684° N, 86.1581° W. That's a bit further west than -84.2. So maybe the longitude here is -84.2, which is east of Indianapolis. Let me think of other cities. Maybe Nashville, Tennessee? Nashville is around 36.1627° N, 86.7816° W. That's too far south and west. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Ohio. Let me check the coordinates again. 39.7805° N, 84.2003° W. If I convert that to a location, maybe it's near the city of Middletown, Ohio? Or perhaps it's in the state of Indiana. Wait, I should use a more systematic approach. 

I can recall that the 40th parallel runs through several states, including Ohio, Indiana, and parts of Illinois. The longitude -84.2 is in the central part of the US. Let me think of the state boundaries. Ohio is between longitudes roughly -84 to -82, and latitudes around 38 to 42. So 39.78 latitude and -84.2 longitude would be in Ohio. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Kentucky? But Kentucky's longitude ranges are more around -84 to -82 as well. Wait, but the latitude 39.78 is a bit north. Let me check approximate locations. If I look up the coordinates 39.7805, -84.2003, maybe it's near the city of Cincinnati? Wait, Cincinnati is at about 39.10° N, 84.51° W. So the given latitude is higher (more north) than Cincinnati, and the longitude is more east. So maybe it's in the northern part of Ohio, near the Indiana border? 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the city of Dayton, Ohio. Dayton's coordinates are approximately 39.7363° N, 84.1916° W. That's very close to the given coordinates. So 39.7805 is slightly north of Dayton, and -84.2003 is slightly east. So that would place it in Ohio. Therefore, the state is Ohio.
