Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 42.2705 latitude and -71.8079 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 42.2705 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -71.8079 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the northern latitudes, especially around the 40s and 42s. The longitude -71.8079 is pretty close to the eastern coast, maybe near New England. Let me think about the major cities in that area. Boston is at around 42.3601° N, 71.0589° W. The given longitude here is -71.8079, which is west of Boston's longitude. So maybe it's a bit further west.

Wait, maybe it's in Massachusetts? But I should check. Alternatively, could it be in New Hampshire or Connecticut? Let me think about the approximate locations. If I look up a map, 42.2705° N, 71.8079° W. Let me convert that to a more familiar place. Maybe it's near Springfield, Massachusetts? Springfield's coordinates are approximately 42.1017° N, 72.5896° W. Hmm, that's a bit further west. Wait, the longitude here is -71.8079, which is east of Springfield's longitude. So maybe it's in the eastern part of Massachusetts.

Alternatively, maybe it's in Rhode Island? But Rhode Island's longitude is around -71.4 to -71.6. Wait, the given longitude is -71.8079, which is more west than that. So maybe it's in Massachusetts. Let me check another city. Worcester, Massachusetts is at about 42.2673° N, 71.8015° W. Oh, that's very close! The given coordinates are 42.2705° N and -71.8079° W. Worcester's longitude is -71.8015, which is just a bit east of the given longitude. So the given point is slightly west of Worcester. That would still be in Massachusetts. 

Alternatively, could it be in Connecticut? Let me check. Hartford, Connecticut is at 41.7655° N, 72.6714° W. That's further south and west. So probably not. So the coordinates are in Massachusetts. Therefore, the state is Massachusetts.
