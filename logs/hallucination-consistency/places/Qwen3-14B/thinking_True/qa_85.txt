Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 27.9631 latitude and -80.6593 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 27.9631 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -80.6593 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the southern part, like Florida, Georgia, Texas, etc. Let me think about the approximate locations. Florida is known for being in the southeastern part of the US. The latitude of 27.96 degrees north is probably in the southern part of Florida, maybe near Miami or somewhere along the Gulf Coast.

Wait, let me check. Miami's coordinates are roughly 25.7617° N, 80.1918° W. So the given longitude here is -80.6593, which is further west than Miami. That might be near Tampa or maybe the Gulf Coast area. Alternatively, maybe it's in the Florida Panhandle? Let me think about the longitude. -80.6593 is about 80.66 degrees west. 

Looking up some major cities in Florida: Tampa is around 27.96° N, 82.45° W. Wait, that's a longitude of -82.45, which is further west than the given -80.65. So maybe not Tampa. How about St. Petersburg? Its coordinates are approximately 27.76° N, 82.62° W. Still more west. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's not a major city. Let me think about the exact coordinates. 27.9631° N, 80.6593° W. Let me convert that to a more familiar location. If I recall, the Florida Keys are further south, but the latitude here is 27.96, which is about 28 degrees north. That's in the southern part of Florida, maybe near the Gulf of Mexico. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Georgia? But Georgia's latitude ranges from about 30° N to 35° N, so 27.96 is a bit south of that. So probably not Georgia. Texas is further west, but the longitude here is -80.65, which is east of Texas. 

Wait, maybe it's in the state of Alabama? Alabama's latitude ranges from about 30° N to 31° N, so again, 27.96 is a bit south. So maybe not Alabama. 

Wait, perhaps it's in the state of Florida. Let me check the approximate area. If I take the coordinates 27.9631° N, 80.6593° W, that's in the western part of Florida, near the Gulf Coast. Let me think of cities in that area. Maybe Naples? Naples, Florida is around 26.15° N, 81.79° W. That's a bit north and west. 

Wait, maybe it's near the city of Fort Myers? Fort Myers is at about 26.55° N, 81.75° W. Still not matching. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's in the area of the Florida Panhandle, but that's more around 30° N. 

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me recall that the longitude -80.6593 is approximately 80.66 degrees west. The prime meridian is 0°, so moving west, each degree is about 69 miles. But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, I can think of the time zones. The longitude -80.66 is in the Eastern Time Zone (UTC-5), which covers parts of Florida, Georgia, etc. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use a map. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my existing knowledge. Let me think again. The coordinates 27.96° N, 80.66° W. If I consider that the Gulf of Mexico is to the west of Florida, then maybe this is near the coast of Florida's western part. 

Wait, the city of Tampa is at about 27.96° N, 82.45° W. Wait, the latitude here is exactly 27.96, which is the same as Tampa's latitude. But the longitude here is -80.66, which is east of Tampa's longitude of -82.45. So that would be further east. So maybe it's near the coast of Florida, but east of Tampa. 

Wait, maybe it's near the city of Sarasota? Sarasota is at about 27.47° N, 82.53° W. Still more west. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's near the city of Orlando? Orlando is around 28.53° N, 81.38° W. That's a bit north and east. 

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the state boundaries. Florida's northern boundary is around 30° N, so 27.96 is well within Florida. The longitude of -80.66 is in the western part of Florida, but not as far west as the Panhandle. So maybe it's in the state of Florida. 

Alternatively, could it be in Alabama? But Alabama's westernmost point is around 87° W, so -80.66 is east of Alabama. So probably not. 

Therefore, I think the coordinates are in the state of Florida. Let me confirm once more. If I take the latitude 27.96° N, that's about 28 degrees north, which is in the southern part of Florida. The longitude -80.66° W is in the western part of Florida, but not as far west as the Panhandle. So maybe near the Gulf Coast, perhaps near the city of Naples or somewhere along the coast. 

Yes, I think the answer is Florida.
