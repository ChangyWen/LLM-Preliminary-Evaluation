Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 41.8375 latitude and -87.6866 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 41.8375 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -87.6866 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of cities with similar coordinates. Let me think about major cities in the Midwest. Chicago comes to mind because I know that Chicago's coordinates are around 41.8781째 N, 87.6298째 W. The given latitude here is 41.8375, which is slightly south of Chicago's latitude. The longitude is -87.6866, which is a bit west of Chicago's longitude. 

Wait, maybe it's a different city in Illinois? Or perhaps it's near Chicago but not exactly the city itself. Let me check if there's a specific place known for those coordinates. Alternatively, maybe it's in Indiana or Michigan? But those states are further north or east. 

Another approach: using the latitude and longitude to determine the state. Latitude 41.8375 is approximately 41 degrees 50 minutes north. Longitude -87.6866 is about 87 degrees 41 minutes west. Looking at a map, that area is in Illinois. The city of Chicago is in Illinois, and the coordinates given are very close to Chicago's. Even though they're not exact, the proximity suggests it's in Illinois. 

I should also consider if there's any other state that might have coordinates in that range. For example, Wisconsin is to the north, but the latitude here is lower than Wisconsin's typical range. Indiana is to the east, but the longitude is more west than Indiana's. So, Illinois seems the most likely. 

Therefore, the state is Illinois.
