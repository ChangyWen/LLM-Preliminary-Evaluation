Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 39.9862 latitude and -82.9855 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 39.9862 is pretty close to 40 degrees north, and longitude -82.9855 is around 83 degrees west. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the central and eastern regions. Let me think about the major cities or landmarks in that area. Cincinnati comes to mind because I know it's in Ohio. Let me check the approximate coordinates for Cincinnati. I think Cincinnati's coordinates are around 39.10 degrees latitude and -84.50 degrees longitude. Wait, but the given longitude here is -82.9855, which is further east than Cincinnati. Hmm, maybe it's a different city.

Wait, maybe it's near Dayton, Ohio? Dayton's coordinates are approximately 39.71 degrees latitude and -84.20 degrees longitude. Still, the longitude here is -82.98, which is more east. Let me think again. Maybe it's in Indiana? Indianapolis is around 39.76 degrees latitude and -86.15 degrees longitude. That's even further west. So maybe not Indiana.

Wait, perhaps it's in Kentucky? Louisville is at about 38.25 degrees latitude and -85.75 degrees longitude. Still not matching. Let me try to think of other cities. Maybe it's near the Ohio River? Let me check. The coordinates given are latitude 39.9862, which is just a bit north of 40 degrees. Longitude -82.9855 is about 83 degrees west. 

Wait, I think the city of Columbus, Ohio is at around 39.96 degrees latitude and -83.00 degrees longitude. That's very close to the given coordinates. The latitude here is 39.9862, which is slightly north of Columbus's 39.96, and the longitude is -82.9855, which is just a bit east of Columbus's -83.00. So that's probably Columbus, Ohio. Therefore, the state would be Ohio. 

But to be sure, maybe I should cross-verify. Let me recall that Ohio's latitude ranges from about 38 degrees to 42 degrees north, and longitude from around 81 to 85 degrees west. The given coordinates are within that range. So yes, Ohio is the correct state. I think that's it.
