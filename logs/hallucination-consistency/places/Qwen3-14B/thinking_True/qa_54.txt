Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 32.7817 latitude and -97.3474 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 32.7817 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -97.3474 is in the western hemisphere since it's negative. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the central part, like Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, etc. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 32 degrees is roughly around the area of Texas, Oklahoma, and maybe even Louisiana. Longitude -97 degrees would be west of the Mississippi River. 

Wait, Dallas is a major city in Texas. Let me check the coordinates of Dallas. I think Dallas is around 32.78 degrees latitude and -96.8 degrees longitude. Hmm, the longitude here is -97.3474, which is a bit further west. Maybe it's near Fort Worth? Fort Worth's coordinates are approximately 32.75 degrees latitude and -97.33 degrees longitude. That's very close to the given coordinates. 

So, if Fort Worth is at around 32.75, -97.33, then the given coordinates 32.7817, -97.3474 would be just a bit north and west of Fort Worth. That would still be in Texas. Let me confirm if there are any other cities or areas in that vicinity. Maybe the coordinates are for a specific location like a landmark or a smaller city. But even so, the state should still be Texas. 

I can also cross-check using a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I'll rely on my existing knowledge. Texas spans a large area, and those coordinates are well within the state's boundaries. The latitude is in the southern part of Texas, and the longitude is in the central-western part. 

Another way to think about it: the central part of Texas, including cities like Dallas, Fort Worth, and Arlington, are all in that general area. The coordinates given are very close to Fort Worth, so the state is definitely Texas. I don't think there's any other state that has that specific combination of latitude and longitude. Oklahoma is a bit north, and Louisiana is to the east, so it's not those. 

Therefore, the answer should be Texas.
