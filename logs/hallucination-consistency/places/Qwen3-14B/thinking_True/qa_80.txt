Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 33.6096 latitude and -117.6551 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 33.6096 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -117.6551 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying coordinates. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 33 degrees north is somewhere around the southern part of the US. For example, cities like Los Angeles are around 34 degrees north, so 33.6 would be a bit south of that. The longitude -117.6551 is west of the Prime Meridian. Let me recall that Los Angeles is at about -118.2437 longitude, so -117.6551 is east of LA, maybe closer to San Diego?

Wait, San Diego's coordinates are approximately 32.7150° N, 117.1611° W. Hmm, but the given latitude here is 33.6, which is a bit north of San Diego. Maybe it's in the area of San Diego but a bit further north. Alternatively, maybe it's in the Inland Empire region of California, which is east of Los Angeles. Let me check some landmarks. 

Another approach: I can think of major cities in California. For example, San Diego is around 32.7° N, so 33.6° N is about 1 degree north, which is roughly 60 miles. That would put it near places like Temecula or maybe even closer to the border with Arizona. Wait, Arizona's southern border is with Mexico, but the coordinates here are in the US. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the city of Riverside or San Bernardino. Let me think about the longitude. -117.6551 is between -117 and -118. San Diego is at -117.16, so this longitude is more west than San Diego. Wait, no, the longitude is -117.65, which is more west than -117.16. Wait, no, the more negative the longitude, the further west. So -117.65 is further west than -117.16. So San Diego is at -117.16, so this point is about 0.5 degrees west of that. That would be further inland, maybe towards the mountains or the Inland Empire area. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the city of Palm Springs? Let me check. Palm Springs is around 33.85° N, 116.55° W. So that's a bit north and east of the given coordinates. The given latitude is 33.6, which is south of Palm Springs. The longitude here is -117.65, which is west of Palm Springs. So maybe it's in the area of San Diego County but further north. 

Wait, another thought: The coordinates 33.6096, -117.6551. Let me try to recall if there's a major city there. Maybe it's near the city of El Cajon or La Mesa, which are in San Diego County. Alternatively, maybe it's in the area of the city of Chula Vista. Let me check approximate coordinates for those cities. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use a map. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my existing knowledge. I know that California's longitude ranges from about -124° W (coastal areas) to -117° W (eastern parts). The given longitude is -117.65, which is within California's range. The latitude 33.6° N is in the southern part of California, so likely in San Diego County or the adjacent areas. 

Therefore, the state is California. I think that's the answer. Let me confirm once more. If I consider that San Diego is at 32.7° N, then moving north by about 0.9 degrees (which is roughly 60 miles) would be into the area of the city of Escondido or Oceanside, which are in San Diego County. The longitude of -117.65 is west of San Diego's longitude, so that would be further inland. So yes, that's still within California. Therefore, the state is California.
