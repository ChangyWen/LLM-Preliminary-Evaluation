Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 27.9945 latitude and -82.4447 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 27.9945 is pretty close to 28 degrees north, and longitude -82.4447 is around 82.44 degrees west. 

I remember that the United States has several states in the southeastern region. Florida comes to mind because it's in that area. Let me think about the approximate coordinates of Florida. The state of Florida is between about 24°N to 31°N latitude and 81°W to 87°W longitude. So 27.99 degrees north would be in the northern part of Florida, maybe near the Gulf Coast or somewhere in the central part.

Now, longitude -82.44 is west of the prime meridian. Let me check some major cities in Florida. Tampa is around 27.97 degrees north and 82.46 degrees west. Wait, that's very close to the given coordinates. So that would be Tampa, Florida. Therefore, the state should be Florida. 

But just to be sure, maybe I should cross-verify. Let me think of other cities. Orlando is further east, around 28.5 degrees north and 81.3 degrees west. So that's east of the given longitude. Jacksonville is more north, around 30 degrees north. So Tampa seems to fit. 

Alternatively, maybe it's near the Florida Panhandle? But the longitude there is more like 85 degrees west, which is further west. So no, -82.44 is more east, which would be central Florida. 

Another way is to use a map or a geographical tool, but since I can't do that right now, relying on known cities. Tampa's coordinates are approximately 27.9945° N, 82.4447° W. So that's exactly the coordinates given. Therefore, the state is Florida.
