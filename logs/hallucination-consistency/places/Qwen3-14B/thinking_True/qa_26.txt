Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 28.4773 latitude and -81.337 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 28.4773 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -81.337 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the southeastern region. Let me think about the approximate locations. Florida is a state that's quite far south, and parts of it have latitudes around 28 degrees. The longitude -81.337 is west of the prime meridian, so that's in the eastern part of the US. 

Wait, Florida's coordinates... I think the city of Jacksonville is around 30 degrees north, but maybe somewhere else. Let me check. Maybe it's in Georgia? But Georgia is a bit north. Alternatively, maybe it's in the Florida Panhandle? Let me think about the exact coordinates. 

Alternatively, I can recall that the coordinates 28.4773, -81.337 might be near a specific city. Let me try to visualize a map. If I take latitude 28.4773, that's approximately 28.5 degrees north. Longitude -81.337 is about 81.3 degrees west. 

Looking at a map, that would place it in the southeastern US. Let me think about the states. Florida is between 24 and 31 degrees north, so 28.5 is within that range. The longitude -81.3 is west of the Florida coast. For example, the city of Daytona Beach is around 29.2 degrees north and 81.3 degrees west. Wait, that's close. But the latitude here is 28.47, which is a bit south of Daytona. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Georgia? But Georgia's southernmost parts are around 28 degrees. Wait, the city of Savannah, Georgia is around 32 degrees north, so that's too far north. Maybe the coordinates are in the Florida Panhandle? Let me check. The Florida Panhandle is along the Gulf Coast, but the longitude there is more like -85 to -87 degrees west. So -81.3 is more east, which would be in central or northern Florida. 

Wait, maybe it's near the city of Orlando? Orlando is around 28.5 degrees north and 81.3 degrees west. That seems to match. Let me confirm. If I look up Orlando's coordinates, they are approximately 28.5383° N, 81.3790° W. The given coordinates are 28.4773° N, -81.337° W. That's very close to Orlando, which is in Florida. So the state would be Florida. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in another city nearby. But given the proximity to Orlando, I think the answer is Florida. Let me make sure there's no other state with similar coordinates. For example, parts of Georgia might have similar latitudes, but the longitude is more west in Georgia. So I think the correct state is Florida.
