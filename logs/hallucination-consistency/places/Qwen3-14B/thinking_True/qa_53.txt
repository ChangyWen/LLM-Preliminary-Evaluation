Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 30.0687 latitude and -89.9288 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 30.0687 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -89.9288 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the southern part with latitudes around 30 degrees. Let me think about the longitude. -89.9288 is pretty close to -90, which is the longitude for the Mississippi River. Wait, the Mississippi River runs through several states, including Louisiana, Mississippi, and parts of others. But the exact longitude of -89.9288 might be near the mouth of the Mississippi River, which is in Louisiana. 

Alternatively, maybe it's near New Orleans? I know New Orleans is in Louisiana, and its coordinates are approximately 30.0687째 N, 90.0687째 W. Wait, the longitude here is -89.9288, which is actually east of the Mississippi River. Let me check that. If the longitude is -89.9288, that's 89.9288 degrees west, which is slightly east of the Mississippi's longitude of about 90 degrees west. So that would place it just east of the Mississippi River. 

Looking at a map, the area around New Orleans is in Louisiana. But maybe the exact point is in a different state? Let me think. The Mississippi River's mouth is in Louisiana, near the Gulf of Mexico. If the longitude is -89.9288, that's very close to the Mississippi's mouth. So the coordinates might be in Louisiana. 

Alternatively, could it be in Mississippi? The Mississippi River flows through Mississippi, but the mouth is in Louisiana. So the coordinates given are likely in Louisiana. Let me confirm by checking approximate locations. If I search for 30.0687, -89.9288, that's near the city of New Orleans, which is in Louisiana. Therefore, the state should be Louisiana.
