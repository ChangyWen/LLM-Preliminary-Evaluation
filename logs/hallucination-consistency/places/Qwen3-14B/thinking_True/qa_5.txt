Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 32.7935 latitude and -96.7667 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 32.7935 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -96.7667 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the central part, like Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, etc. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 32 degrees north is around the area of Texas, Oklahoma, and maybe Louisiana. The longitude -96.7 degrees west... Well, the prime meridian is 0, so negative longitudes are west. Let me recall that Dallas, Texas is around 32.78 degrees north and 96.8 degrees west. Wait, the longitude here is -96.7667, which is slightly east of Dallas. So maybe that's near Dallas or Fort Worth?

Alternatively, I can think of major cities. Let me check if I remember the coordinates of Dallas. Yes, Dallas is approximately 32.78째 N, 96.80째 W. The given longitude here is -96.7667, which is a bit east of Dallas. So maybe that's in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Since Dallas is in Texas, that would put the coordinates in Texas. 

But wait, I should make sure there's no other state nearby. Oklahoma is to the north of Texas, but the latitude 32.79 is still in the southern part of Oklahoma. However, Oklahoma's southern border is around 33 degrees north, so 32.79 is just south of that. So maybe it's in Texas. 

Another way is to think about the time zone. The longitude -96.7667 is in the Central Time Zone, which includes Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, etc. But that's not definitive. However, given the latitude and longitude, the closest major city is Dallas, which is in Texas. Therefore, the state is likely Texas. 

I can also cross-check by recalling that the coordinates 32.7935, -96.7667 are for the city of Dallas, Texas. So the answer should be Texas.
