Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 40.6501 latitude and -73.9496 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 40.6501 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -73.9496 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that New York City is around 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W. Let me check the given coordinates. The latitude here is 40.6501, which is slightly south of NYC's latitude. The longitude is -73.9496, which is about 73.95 degrees west. Comparing that to NYC's longitude of 74.006, this location is a bit east of NYC. 

Wait, maybe it's somewhere in New York State. Let me think. The coordinates might be in Manhattan. For example, the Empire State Building is at approximately 40.7488° N, 73.9858° W. The given coordinates are a bit south and east of that. Maybe it's near the southern part of Manhattan? 

Alternatively, I can use a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I'll have to rely on known landmarks. The coordinates 40.6501, -73.9496 are close to the southern tip of Manhattan, maybe near the Battery or the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty is at around 40.6892° N, 74.0445° W, which is a bit north and west. Hmm, maybe it's in Brooklyn? 

Wait, Brooklyn's coordinates are roughly similar to Manhattan's. Let me think again. If the latitude is 40.65, that's about 40 degrees 39 minutes north. The longitude is 73 degrees 56.976 minutes west. So, looking at a map, that would place it in the southern part of Manhattan, perhaps near the Financial District or the area around Wall Street. 

But I need to confirm the state. New York City is in New York State. So regardless of the specific city within the state, the state would be New York. Therefore, the answer should be New York.
