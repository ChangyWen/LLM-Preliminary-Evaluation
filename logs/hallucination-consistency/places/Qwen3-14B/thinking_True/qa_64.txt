Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 36.1283 latitude and -95.9042 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 36.1283 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -95.9042 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the central part, so maybe that's where this is. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 36 degrees is around the area of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, maybe Missouri. Longitude -95.9 is west of the Mississippi River, so that would be in the central US.

Wait, Oklahoma City is at around 35.47 degrees north and -97.5 degrees west. Hmm, that's a bit further west. But maybe the coordinates given are in Oklahoma. Alternatively, maybe it's in Kansas? Let me check some major cities. Wichita, Kansas is at about 37.7 degrees north and -97.3 degrees west. That's a bit north and west of the given coordinates. 

Another thought: the coordinates might be in the central part of Oklahoma. Let me think about the approximate location. If I convert those coordinates to a map, maybe using a tool. But since I can't access external tools, I need to rely on my knowledge. 

Alternatively, I can think of the approximate area. The longitude -95.9 is between the Mississippi River (around -90) and the Rocky Mountains (around -105). So that's central US. The latitude 36 degrees is roughly the same as the southern part of Kansas, Oklahoma, and northern Texas. 

Wait, the city of Oklahoma City is at 35.47, which is a bit south of 36.1. Maybe the coordinates are in the northern part of Oklahoma. Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Missouri? Let me think. St. Louis is at around 38.6 degrees north, which is north of 36.1. So probably not Missouri. 

Another approach: the longitude -95.9 is about 95.9 degrees west. The central time zone is around that longitude. So the state would be in the central time zone. Oklahoma is in the central time zone. Kansas is also in the central time zone. Texas is in central time zone in the western part. 

If I consider that 36 degrees north is about the same as the latitude of Oklahoma City, but a bit north. Maybe the coordinates are in Oklahoma. Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Arkansas? But Arkansas is more south, around 34-35 degrees. 

Wait, I think I've heard that the coordinates 36.1283, -95.9042 are for Oklahoma City. Let me confirm. Oklahoma City's coordinates are approximately 35.47 degrees north, -97.5 degrees west. Wait, that's not matching. The given longitude here is -95.9, which is east of Oklahoma City. So maybe it's a different city. 

Wait, maybe it's in the state of Kansas. Let me think of Topeka, the capital of Kansas. Topeka is at about 39.05 degrees north, -95.66 degrees west. That's a bit north and east of the given coordinates. The given latitude is 36.1, which is south of Topeka. So maybe somewhere in central Kansas? 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Texas. Let me think of Dallas, which is at 32.7767° N, 96.7989° W. That's south and west of the given coordinates. So maybe not Dallas. 

Wait, perhaps the coordinates are in the state of Oklahoma, but not Oklahoma City. Maybe a different city. Let me think of Norman, Oklahoma. Norman is at about 35.207° N, 97.456° W. Still west of the given longitude. 

Hmm, maybe I need to think of the approximate area. The longitude -95.9 is east of the 96th meridian. So that's east of Oklahoma City. The latitude 36.1 is about 36 degrees north. So maybe in the state of Oklahoma, but in the eastern part. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Missouri. Let me check. The city of Joplin, Missouri is at 37.0667° N, 94.5667° W. That's north and east of the given coordinates. 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should recall that the coordinates 36.1283, -95.9042 are for the city of Oklahoma City. But earlier I thought Oklahoma City is at 35.47, but maybe I was wrong. Let me check my memory again. 

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the coordinates. Let me think of the approximate location. If I take 36 degrees north and 95.9 west, that's in the central part of the US. Maybe the state of Oklahoma. Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Kansas. 

Alternatively, I can think of the approximate area. The longitude -95.9 is about 95.9 degrees west, which is east of the 96th meridian. The latitude 36.1 is about 36 degrees north. So that's in the central US. 

Wait, I think I remember that the coordinates 36.1283, -95.9042 are for the city of Oklahoma City. But I need to verify. Let me think again. Oklahoma City is in Oklahoma, and if the coordinates are 36.1283, -95.9042, that would place it in Oklahoma. Maybe I was mistaken earlier about Oklahoma City's coordinates. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Kansas. But I'm not sure. Another approach: the longitude -95.9 is approximately 95.9 degrees west. The central time zone is from about 97.5 to 90 degrees west. So that's within the central time zone. 

If I consider that, then the state would be in the central time zone. Oklahoma, Kansas, and parts of Texas and Missouri are in the central time zone. 

Given that the latitude is 36.1, which is about the same as the southern part of Kansas and northern part of Oklahoma. So maybe Oklahoma. 

Alternatively, I can think of the approximate area. If I take 36 degrees north and 95.9 west, that's in the central part of Oklahoma. So the answer is Oklahoma.
