Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 39.1413 latitude and -84.506 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 39.1413 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -84.506 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying latitudes and longitudes. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 39 degrees is around the middle of the US, maybe somewhere in the Midwest or the East Coast. Longitude -84.5 degrees is west of the prime meridian. Let me recall that the longitude for places like Chicago is around -87.6, so -84.5 would be east of Chicago. 

Wait, maybe it's in Kentucky? I think Kentucky's longitude ranges are around -84 to -86. Let me check. Also, latitude 39 degrees would be in the northern part of Kentucky. Alternatively, could it be Ohio? Ohio's latitude ranges from about 38 to 42, so 39.14 is within that. But longitude for Ohio is around -83 to -85. So -84.5 is within Ohio's longitude range. 

Wait, but I need to be precise. Maybe I can think of major cities. Cincinnati, Ohio is at approximately 39.10 degrees latitude and -84.50 degrees longitude. That seems very close to the given coordinates. So that would place it in Ohio. Let me confirm. If Cincinnati is at 39.10, -84.50, then the given coordinates are just slightly north and west of that. So that's still within Ohio. 

Alternatively, maybe it's near Louisville, Kentucky? Louisville is at around 38.25 degrees latitude and -85.75 longitude. That's south and west of the given coordinates. So not Kentucky. So more likely Ohio. 

Another way: using an online map or a geographical database. But since I can't access that, I have to rely on known cities. So I think the answer is Ohio.
