Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 40.2752 latitude and -76.8843 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 40.2752 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -76.8843 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the 40-degree latitude range. Let me think about the longitude. -76 degrees west is somewhere in the eastern part of the US. Pennsylvania, maybe? Because I know that Philadelphia is around 39.9526° N, 75.1652° W. But the longitude here is -76.8843, which is further west. Wait, maybe it's in Pennsylvania but a bit more west. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Ohio? Ohio's longitude ranges are around -83 to -80, so that's too far west. How about New Jersey? Their longitude is around -74 to -75, so that's east of the given coordinates. So Pennsylvania seems more likely. 

Let me check some major cities in Pennsylvania. Pittsburgh is at about 40.4433° N, 79.9959° W. That's further west. The given longitude is -76.8843, which is between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Maybe Harrisburg? Harrisburg's coordinates are approximately 40.2696° N, 76.8872° W. Oh, that's very close to the given coordinates. So that's in Pennsylvania. 

Therefore, the state should be Pennsylvania. I should confirm if there are any other states nearby, but given the coordinates, Pennsylvania is the correct answer.
