Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 41.3113 latitude and -72.9246 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 41.3113 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -72.9246 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the eastern part, so maybe that's somewhere in the eastern US. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 41 degrees is around the area of cities like Chicago, which is in Illinois, but longitude -72.9246 is more west than Chicago's longitude, which is around -87.6. Wait, no, that's more west. Wait, -72.9246 is actually further east than Chicago. Wait, longitude values get more negative as you go west. So -72.9246 is west of the prime meridian, but how does that compare to other states?

Let me think of some major cities. New York City is around 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W. So that's latitude 40.7, longitude -74.0. The given latitude is 41.3, which is a bit north of NYC. The longitude here is -72.9, which is east of NYC's longitude. So that would be to the east of NYC. Maybe somewhere in New Jersey? Or Connecticut?

Wait, Connecticut's longitude is around -72.6 to -73.0. Let me check. For example, Hartford, Connecticut is at about 41.7657° N, 72.6714° W. Wait, that's latitude 41.76, which is higher than 41.31. But the longitude here is -72.67, which is more west than -72.92. Wait, no, -72.92 is more west than -72.67. So if the longitude is -72.92, that's further west than Hartford. Maybe somewhere in New York state? Let me think about the coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe it's in New Jersey. Let me check a map. If I take latitude 41.31 and longitude -72.92, that's approximately in the area of the town of New Milford, New Jersey? Or maybe somewhere in the northern part of New Jersey. Alternatively, maybe it's in Pennsylvania? Wait, Pennsylvania's longitude ranges are more around -75 to -76, so probably not.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Using an online tool or a map. But since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me recall that the coordinates 41.3113, -72.9246. Let me convert that to a more familiar place. For example, the city of New Haven, Connecticut is at approximately 41.3036° N, 72.9327° W. Wait, that's very close! The given coordinates are 41.3113 N and -72.9246 W. New Haven's coordinates are 41.3036 N and -72.9327 W. So the given coordinates are just a bit north and east of New Haven. That would place it in Connecticut, specifically in New Haven County. Therefore, the state is Connecticut.
