Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 40.0077 latitude and -75.1339 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 40 degrees north is somewhere in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is -75.1339, which is west of the Prime Meridian. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the 40-degree latitude range. For example, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York are around that area. The longitude of -75 degrees is pretty close to the eastern part of the US. Let me think about major cities. Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania, and I think its coordinates are around 40 degrees north and 75 degrees west. Let me check that. 

Wait, the longitude here is -75.1339, which is 75.1339 degrees west. Philadelphia's coordinates are approximately 39.9526° N, 75.1652° W. Hmm, that's close. The given latitude here is 40.0077, which is slightly north of Philadelphia. Maybe it's a bit further north in Pennsylvania. 

Alternatively, maybe it's near Pittsburgh? Pittsburgh's coordinates are around 40.4406° N, 79.9959° W. That's more west, so longitude around -80, which is further west than -75. So that's probably not it. 

Another thought: the longitude of -75.1339 is very close to the longitude of Philadelphia. The latitude is 40.0077, which is just a bit north of 40 degrees. So maybe it's in Pennsylvania, near the northern part of the state. 

I can also think about the boundaries. Pennsylvania's northern border is with New York, and the southern border with Maryland. The latitude of 40 degrees is roughly the southern part of Pennsylvania. Wait, but 40 degrees north is actually the northern boundary of Pennsylvania? No, Pennsylvania's northern boundary is more like 42 degrees north, near the New York border. So maybe the coordinates are in the central or southern part of Pennsylvania. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in New Jersey? But New Jersey's longitude is more around -74 to -75 degrees. Wait, the longitude here is -75.13, which is more west than New Jersey. So probably not New Jersey. 

Another approach: using an online map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my knowledge. Let me think of major cities again. Philadelphia is at about 39.95° N, 75.16° W. The given latitude is 40.0077, which is about 0.05 degrees north, which is roughly 5.5 miles (since 1 degree is about 69 miles). So that's just a few miles north of Philadelphia. 

So the coordinates would be in Pennsylvania, near the city of Philadelphia. Therefore, the state is Pennsylvania.
