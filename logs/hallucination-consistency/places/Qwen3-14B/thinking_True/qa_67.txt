Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 33.5279 latitude and -86.7971 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 33.5279 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -86.7971 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the central and southern regions. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 33 degrees is around the same as places like Memphis, Tennessee, or maybe Birmingham, Alabama. Longitude -86.7971 is roughly in the central part of the country. 

Wait, I should check if there's a major city near those coordinates. Let me recall that Birmingham, Alabama is at approximately 33.5207° N, 86.8029° W. The given coordinates are 33.5279 and -86.7971. That's very close to Birmingham. So that would be in Alabama. 

But I should make sure there's no other city or area in a different state with similar coordinates. Maybe check if it's near the border with another state. Alabama borders Tennessee, Georgia, and Mississippi. But given the longitude, it's more central, so probably Alabama. 

Alternatively, I can think about the time zone. The longitude -86.7971 is in the Central Time Zone, which includes Alabama, Tennessee, and parts of other states. But that's not definitive. 

Another way is to think about the approximate distance from known points. If I take the coordinates and plug them into a map, but since I can't do that right now, I have to rely on memory. Birmingham is a major city in Alabama, and the coordinates given are very close to its actual coordinates. So I'm pretty confident it's Alabama. 

I should also consider if there's any possibility of it being in another state. For example, parts of Tennessee are around that latitude, but the longitude is more west for Tennessee. Wait, Memphis is at about 35° N, which is a bit north. So 33.5 is more southern. So Alabama makes sense. 

Therefore, the state is Alabama.
