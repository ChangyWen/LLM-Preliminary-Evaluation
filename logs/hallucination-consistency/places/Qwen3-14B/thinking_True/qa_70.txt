Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 34.0378 latitude and -80.9036 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 34.0378 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -80.9036 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the southeastern region. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 34 degrees north is around the area of the Carolinas, Georgia, maybe even Tennessee. The longitude -80 degrees west would place it somewhere east of the Mississippi River. 

Wait, Charleston, South Carolina is a major city there. Let me check the coordinates for Charleston. I think Charleston's coordinates are roughly 32.9878° N, 79.9311° W. Hmm, that's a bit north and east of the given coordinates. The given latitude is 34.0378, which is a bit further north than Charleston. Maybe it's in the northern part of South Carolina or even Georgia?

Alternatively, maybe it's near Columbia, South Carolina. Let me recall Columbia's coordinates. Columbia is around 34.0000° N, 81.0844° W. Wait, the longitude here is -80.9036, which is west of Columbia's longitude. So that would be more towards the east coast. 

Another thought: the coordinates might be near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Let me check that. Myrtle Beach is approximately 33.6125° N, 78.8838° W. That's a bit south and east of the given coordinates. The latitude here is 34.0378, which is a bit north of Myrtle Beach. 

Wait, maybe it's in North Carolina? Let me think about Wilmington, North Carolina. Its coordinates are around 34.2234° N, 77.4560° W. That's further north and east. The longitude here is -80.9036, which is west of Wilmington. So maybe somewhere between Wilmington and Charleston?

Alternatively, maybe it's in Georgia. Savannah, Georgia is at about 32.0838° N, 81.0998° W. That's too far south and east. 

Wait, perhaps I should use a more systematic approach. Let me recall that the longitude -80.9036 is equivalent to 80.9036 degrees west. So, looking at a map, 80 degrees west longitude would pass through the eastern part of the US. At 34 degrees north latitude, that would be in the southeastern US. 

Looking up a map or using a geographical tool, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on memory. The coordinates 34.0378, -80.9036 are likely in South Carolina. Let me think of cities in South Carolina with that latitude and longitude. Maybe the area around Columbia or near the border with Georgia? 

Wait, another approach: the longitude -80.9036 is approximately 80.9 degrees west. The city of Florence, South Carolina is at around 34.1583° N, 80.9036° W. Wait, that longitude matches exactly! So Florence, South Carolina is at approximately 34.1583° N, 80.9036° W. The given latitude is 34.0378, which is slightly south of Florence. So that would be in South Carolina, near Florence. 

Therefore, the state is South Carolina.
