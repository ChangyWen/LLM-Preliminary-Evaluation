Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 38.6359 latitude and -90.2451 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out how to determine the state from these coordinates.

I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location on a map. Latitude 38.6359 is in the northern hemisphere since it's positive. The longitude is -90.2451, which is west of the Prime Meridian. Now, I need to figure out which U.S. state this falls into.

I know that the United States spans a range of latitudes and longitudes. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 38 degrees is roughly around the middle of the U.S., maybe in the central or southern parts. For longitude, -90 degrees west is near the Mississippi River. States like Missouri, Illinois, or Arkansas might be in that area.

Wait, St. Louis, Missouri is at approximately 38.6 degrees latitude and -90.18 degrees longitude. The given coordinates are 38.6359 and -90.2451. That seems very close to St. Louis. So, Missouri is likely the state here. Let me double-check. Maybe using an online map or a geographical database would confirm, but since I can't access external resources, I'll rely on my existing knowledge. Yes, St. Louis is in Missouri, and those coordinates are in the vicinity. Therefore, the state should be Missouri.
