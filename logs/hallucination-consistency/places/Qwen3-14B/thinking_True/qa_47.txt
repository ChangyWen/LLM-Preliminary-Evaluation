Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 35.1087 latitude and -89.9663 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 35.1087 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -89.9663 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the central and southern regions with those latitudes. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 35 degrees is around the middle of the country, maybe in the southern part. Longitude -90 degrees is roughly near the Mississippi River. So, maybe that's in the central part of the US.

Wait, I should check if there are any major cities or landmarks near those coordinates. Let me recall. Memphis, Tennessee is a big city in that area. What's the latitude and longitude of Memphis? I think Memphis is around 35.1495° N, 90.0490° W. Hmm, the given longitude here is -89.9663, which is slightly east of Memphis. So maybe it's near Memphis but a bit to the east. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Arkansas or Missouri? But Memphis is in Tennessee. Let me think about the exact coordinates. If the longitude is -89.9663, that's about 89.9663 degrees west. Memphis is at about 90.0490, so this point is a bit east of Memphis. So maybe it's in Shelby County, Tennessee, which is where Memphis is located. 

Another way to check is to use a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. The coordinates 35.1087, -89.9663 are very close to the city of Memphis. Let me confirm the exact coordinates of Memphis again. If Memphis is at approximately 35.1495° N, 90.0490° W, then the given coordinates are a bit south and east of Memphis. 

Wait, the latitude here is 35.1087, which is slightly south of Memphis's latitude (35.1495). The longitude is -89.9663, which is east of Memphis's longitude (-90.0490). So that would place it just east of Memphis, maybe in the same area. Since Memphis is in Tennessee, the state would be Tennessee. 

I think that's right. So the answer should be Tennessee.
