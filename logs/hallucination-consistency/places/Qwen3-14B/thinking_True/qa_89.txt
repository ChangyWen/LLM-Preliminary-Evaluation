Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 40.5834 latitude and -74.1496 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 40.5834 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -74.1496 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the eastern part, especially around the 40th parallel. New York comes to mind because I know that New York City is around 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W. The given longitude here is -74.1496, which is slightly west of NYC's longitude. The latitude is 40.5834, which is a bit south of NYC's latitude. 

So, maybe this is somewhere in New York state. Let me think about specific cities. Newark, New Jersey is near 40.7357° N, 74.1724° W. Wait, that's a bit north and west. But the given coordinates are 40.5834 N and -74.1496 W. That would be south of NYC and maybe in New Jersey? Or perhaps in New York?

Wait, let me check. If I convert those coordinates to a location, maybe using a map. Alternatively, I can recall that the coordinates 40.5834, -74.1496 are approximately in the area of the Port of New York and New Jersey. But which state? The longitude is -74.1496, which is west of NYC's longitude. Let me think about the border between New York and New Jersey. The Hudson River is the boundary between them. 

If I look up the coordinates, 40.5834° N, 74.1496° W is actually in New Jersey. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should cross-check. For example, the city of Elizabeth, New Jersey is around 40.6366° N, 74.1667° W. That's a bit north and west. The given latitude is 40.5834, which is south of that. Maybe it's in the southern part of New Jersey? Or perhaps in New York's Hudson County?

Alternatively, maybe it's in the New York City area. Let me think about the exact location. If I plug these coordinates into a map, they might point to a specific place. But since I can't do that right now, I need to rely on my knowledge. 

Another approach: the latitude 40.5834 is approximately 40 degrees 35 minutes north. The longitude -74.1496 is about 74 degrees 8.976 minutes west. So, looking at a map, that would be in the area of the New York metropolitan area, but slightly south of NYC. The state line between New York and New Jersey runs along the Hudson River. If the coordinates are west of the Hudson River, it would be in New York, and east would be New Jersey. 

Wait, the longitude here is -74.1496, which is west of NYC's longitude (-74.0060). So that would be west of NYC, which is in New York state. But the Hudson River is the boundary. So if the longitude is west of the river, it's in New York. But I need to confirm if that's the case. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in New Jersey. I'm a bit confused. Let me think of another way. The coordinates 40.5834, -74.1496 are very close to the coordinates of the Port of Elizabeth, New Jersey? Or maybe it's in the New York area. 

Wait, I think I remember that the coordinates 40.5834° N, 74.1496° W correspond to the location of the Statue of Liberty. Wait, no, the Statue of Liberty is at 40.6892° N, 74.0445° W. That's a bit north and east. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the area of the New York City's Liberty Island. No, that's not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the area of the New York City's Financial District. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the longitude -74.1496 is approximately 74 degrees 8.976 minutes west. The longitude of NYC is about 74 degrees 0 minutes west. So this is about 8.976 minutes west of NYC, which is roughly 1.5 miles west. So that would be west of NYC, which is in New York state. But the Hudson River is to the west of NYC. So if the coordinates are west of the river, it's in New York. But I need to check if that's the case. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in New Jersey. For example, the city of Newark is at 40.7357° N, 74.1724° W. That's a bit north and west of the given coordinates. The given coordinates are south of that. So maybe it's in the area of Elizabeth, New Jersey? But I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of New York. Since the longitude is west of NYC, which is in New York, and the latitude is 40.58, which is south of NYC's 40.71. So that would be in the southern part of New York state, perhaps in the Hudson Valley or near the New Jersey border. 

Wait, but the exact coordinates might be in New Jersey. Let me think of another approach. If I take the coordinates and convert them to a place name. For example, using a reverse geocoding method. But since I can't do that here, I need to rely on known locations. 

Another thought: the coordinates 40.5834, -74.1496 are approximately 40.5834° N, 74.1496° W. If I look up a map, this is in the area of the New York City metropolitan area, but slightly south. The state line between New York and New Jersey runs along the Hudson River. If the longitude is west of the Hudson River, it's in New York. If east, it's in New Jersey. 

The Hudson River is at approximately longitude -74.0 degrees. Wait, the longitude of the Hudson River near NYC is around -74.0 degrees. So the given longitude is -74.1496, which is west of that. Therefore, it's west of the Hudson River, which would be in New York state. 

Therefore, the coordinates are in New York state.
