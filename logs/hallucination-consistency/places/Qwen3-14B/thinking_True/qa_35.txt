Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 30.3005 latitude and -97.7522 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 30.3005 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -97.7522 is in the western hemisphere since it's negative. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the central and southern regions with those latitudes. Let me think about major cities. The coordinates might be for a city. Let me check if I can recall any cities around that area. 

Wait, Dallas is in Texas. What's the latitude and longitude of Dallas? I think Dallas is around 32.7767° N, 96.7969° W. Hmm, that's a bit north and east of the given coordinates. The given latitude is 30.3005, which is lower (south) than Dallas. Maybe San Antonio? San Antonio's coordinates are approximately 29.4245° N, 98.4936° W. That's a bit south and west of Dallas. The given longitude is -97.7522, which is between Dallas and San Antonio. 

Wait, maybe it's Austin? Let me think. Austin, Texas is around 30.2672° N, 97.7431° W. Oh, that's very close to the given coordinates. The latitude 30.2672 is almost 30.3005, and the longitude 97.7431 is very near to -97.7522. So the coordinates are likely for Austin, Texas. Therefore, the state would be Texas. 

I should double-check to make sure there aren't other cities in nearby states with similar coordinates. For example, Oklahoma or Louisiana. But given the longitude of -97.75, which is west of the 98th meridian, Texas is more likely. Also, the latitude of 30.3 is in the southern part of Texas, which aligns with cities like Austin. 

So I'm pretty confident the answer is Texas.
