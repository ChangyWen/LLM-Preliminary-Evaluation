Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 47.6671 latitude and -117.433 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 47.6671 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -117.433 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying coordinates. Let me think about the major cities or regions that have those coordinates. The latitude 47.6671 is close to Seattle, Washington, because I know that Seattle's coordinates are around 47.6062° N, 122.3321° W. Wait, but the longitude here is -117.433, which is more east than Seattle. Maybe it's somewhere in the Pacific Northwest but not Seattle.

Wait, maybe it's Spokane, Washington? Let me check. Spokane's coordinates are approximately 47.6571° N, 117.4333° W. Oh, that's very close to the given coordinates. The latitude is 47.6571 vs. the given 47.6671, which is just a small difference, and the longitude is -117.433, which matches exactly. So that must be Spokane, Washington. Therefore, the state would be Washington.

But just to be sure, I should confirm. Maybe there's another city with similar coordinates. Let me think. The longitude -117.433 is in the eastern part of Washington state. Spokane is in eastern Washington, near the Idaho border. Yes, that makes sense. So the state is Washington.
