Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 38.1663 latitude and -85.6485 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out how to determine the state from these coordinates.

I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location on a map. Latitude 38.1663 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -85.6485 is in the western hemisphere. The negative longitude means it's west of the Prime Meridian. 

Now, I should think about the approximate locations. Latitude 38 degrees is around the middle of the United States. For example, cities like Chicago are around 41.8781° N, so 38 degrees is a bit further south. Longitude -85.6485 is west of the 85th meridian. Let me recall that the state of Kentucky is in the central part of the US. The capital of Kentucky is Frankfort, which I think is around 38.1663° N, 84.8631° W. Wait, the longitude here is -85.6485, which is more west than Frankfort. Maybe it's near Louisville? Let me check. Louisville, Kentucky is at approximately 38.2500° N, 85.7585° W. Hmm, the given longitude is -85.6485, which is between Frankfort and Louisville. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Indiana? The border between Kentucky and Indiana is around that area. Let me think. The coordinates 38.1663, -85.6485. If I convert that to a map, maybe using an online tool or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. 

Another approach: The latitude 38.1663 is approximately 38 degrees 10 minutes north. The longitude -85.6485 is about 85 degrees 39 minutes west. The 38th parallel runs through several states, including parts of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri. The longitude around -85 degrees is in the central US. 

Wait, the city of Bowling Green, Kentucky is at around 38.0000° N, 85.6667° W. That's very close to the given longitude of -85.6485. So that would place the coordinates near Bowling Green, which is in Kentucky. Therefore, the state is Kentucky. 

I should double-check if there's any other state nearby. Indiana is to the north of Kentucky, but the latitude 38 is more in the southern part of Indiana. However, the longitude -85.6485 is west of the Indiana-Kentucky border. So yes, it's likely Kentucky. 

So the answer should be Kentucky.
