Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 33.9381 latitude and -117.3949 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 33.9381 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -117.3949 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying coordinates. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude 33 degrees north is somewhere around the southern part of the US, maybe Texas or California? Wait, but longitude -117 is pretty far west. California's longitude is around that range. For example, Los Angeles is at about 34 degrees north and 118 degrees west. Wait, but the longitude here is -117.3949, which is 117.3949 degrees west. That's actually east of Los Angeles. 

Let me check some major cities. San Diego is in California, and its coordinates are approximately 32.7150° N, 117.1611° W. The given latitude here is 33.9381, which is a bit north of San Diego. Maybe that's near San Diego but a bit further north. Alternatively, maybe it's in another part of California. 

Another thought: the longitude -117.3949 is 117.3949 degrees west. Let me convert that to a more familiar format. Since it's negative, it's west. So 117 degrees west is between 117 and 118 degrees west. San Diego is at 117.16, so this is a bit further west. Wait, no, the longitude here is -117.39, which is 117.39 degrees west. That's actually west of San Diego's longitude. Wait, San Diego is at 117.16, so 117.39 is more west. So that would be further west along the coast. 

But maybe I should use a map or a tool to check. However, since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my existing knowledge. Let me think of other cities. Maybe it's near the city of San Clemente or Dana Point in California. Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Arizona? Wait, Arizona's longitude is more around 112 degrees west. So that's east of California. 

Another approach: the latitude 33.9381 is approximately 33.94 degrees north. Let me think of states that have that latitude. Texas is around 31-37 degrees north, so 33.94 would be in the northern part of Texas. But longitude -117 is way west of Texas. Texas is more around 99-103 degrees west. So that's not matching. 

So going back, California is the likely state. The coordinates are in the southern part of California, near the coast. Maybe near the city of San Diego or further north. Wait, San Diego is at 32.7150° N, so 33.9381 is about 1.2 degrees north of that. That would be roughly 70 miles north, which would be near the city of Oceanside or Carlsbad, California. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Nevada? But Nevada's longitude is more around 115-118 degrees west. Wait, but the latitude for Nevada is more around 38-42 degrees north. So 33.94 is south of that. So probably not Nevada. 

Another check: the coordinates 33.9381, -117.3949. Let me think of the approximate location. If I recall, the city of San Diego is at about 32.7150° N, 117.1611° W. The given longitude is -117.3949, which is 117.3949 degrees west. That's 0.23 degrees west of San Diego's longitude. Wait, no, San Diego is at 117.16, so 117.39 is more west. So that's about 0.23 degrees west, which is roughly 13 miles west. So that would be a bit west of San Diego. 

But the latitude is 33.9381, which is 1.2 degrees north of San Diego's latitude. So combining both, that would be a location north and west of San Diego. That area is still in California, maybe near the city of Encinitas or Del Mar. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the state of Arizona? No, Arizona is east of California. So I think the answer is California. Therefore, the state is California.
