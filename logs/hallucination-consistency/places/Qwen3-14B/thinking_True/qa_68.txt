Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 32.8168 latitude and -79.9687 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 32.8168 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -79.9687 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states in the southeastern region. Let me think about the approximate locations. The latitude of 32 degrees is around the area of the southeastern US, like Georgia, South Carolina, or maybe even Florida. The longitude of -80 degrees is west of the prime meridian. Let me recall that the longitude for cities like Charleston, South Carolina, is around -79.9687. Wait, that's very close to the given longitude. 

So, if I check Charleston, South Carolina, its coordinates are approximately 32.8168째 N, 79.9687째 W. That matches exactly with the coordinates provided. Therefore, the state would be South Carolina. Let me double-check to make sure I'm not confusing it with another city. For example, Savannah, Georgia, is a bit further south, and the longitude might be slightly different. But given the exact match here, it's likely Charleston, SC. So the answer should be South Carolina.
