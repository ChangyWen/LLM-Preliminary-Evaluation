Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 38.9047 latitude and -77.0163 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 38.9047 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -77.0163 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of states with varying coordinates. Let me think about the major cities. Washington, D.C. is a well-known location. I think its coordinates are around 38.9072° N, 77.0369° W. Comparing that to the given coordinates, 38.9047 is very close to that latitude, and -77.0163 is slightly east of Washington, D.C.'s longitude. 

Wait, but Washington, D.C. is not a state; it's the capital of the United States. However, it's located in the state of Maryland and Virginia, but technically, it's a federal district. However, the question is asking for the state. So, if the coordinates are near Washington, D.C., the answer might be that it's in the District of Columbia, but since the user is asking for a state, maybe they expect the surrounding states. But I think the correct answer here is that the coordinates are in the District of Columbia, which is not a state but a federal district. However, sometimes people might refer to it as part of Maryland or Virginia, but officially, it's a separate entity. 

Alternatively, maybe I should check if there's a city or place nearby that's in a specific state. Let me confirm the exact location. Using a map or a geographical database, 38.9047° N, 77.0163° W is indeed very close to the center of Washington, D.C. So the answer would be the District of Columbia. But the user asked for the state. Since D.C. isn't a state, perhaps the answer is that it's in the District of Columbia, which is not a state. However, the user might be expecting the answer as "District of Columbia" even though it's not a state. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the coordinates? Let me double-check. 

Another way is to think about the longitude. -77.0163 is approximately 77 degrees west. The longitude of Washington, D.C. is around -77.0369, so the given longitude is slightly east of that. The latitude 38.9047 is very close to the latitude of D.C. So the location is just a bit east of D.C. But since D.C. is between Maryland and Virginia, maybe the exact location is in Maryland or Virginia? Wait, but the coordinates are in the middle of D.C. So the answer is the District of Columbia. However, the user asked for the state. Since D.C. is not a state, perhaps the answer is that it's in the District of Columbia, which is a federal district. But maybe the user is expecting the answer as "Maryland" or "Virginia" because D.C. is surrounded by those states. However, the exact coordinates are within D.C. itself. 

I think the correct answer here is that the coordinates are located in the District of Columbia. Even though it's not a state, that's the official location. So I should state that.
