Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 40.6943 latitude and -73.9249 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 40.6943 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -73.9249 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that New York City is around 40.7 degrees latitude and -74 degrees longitude. Let me check if these coordinates are close to NYC. The latitude given is 40.6943, which is just slightly south of 40.7, and the longitude is -73.9249, which is a bit east of -74. That would place it in Manhattan, maybe near the southern part of the city. 

Now, New York City is in New York State. But wait, I should make sure there aren't any other places with similar coordinates. Maybe some other cities or regions? But given the proximity to NYC's coordinates, it's highly likely to be New York. Also, considering the longitude, -73.9249 is within the range of New York City's longitude, which spans roughly from -73.9 to -74.0. 

Another way to confirm is to think about major landmarks. For example, the Empire State Building is at around 40.7488째 N, 73.9858째 W. The given coordinates are a bit south and east of that, which would be more towards the southern part of Manhattan, maybe near the Financial District or Battery Park. 

I don't think there are any other major cities in that exact area with those coordinates. So, the state should be New York. I should also consider if there's any possibility of it being in a neighboring state, but given the coordinates, it's definitely within New York State. 

Therefore, the answer is New York.
