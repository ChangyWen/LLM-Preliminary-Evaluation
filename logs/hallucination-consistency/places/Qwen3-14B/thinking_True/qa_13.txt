Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the state where the coordinates 47.6211 latitude and -122.3244 longitude are located. First, I need to figure out what those coordinates correspond to. Latitude 47.6211 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -122.3244 is in the western hemisphere. 

I remember that the United States has a lot of cities with similar coordinates. Let me think about major cities in the Pacific Northwest. Seattle comes to mind because I know that Seattle's coordinates are around 47.6205° N, 122.3493° W. The given latitude is 47.6211, which is very close to that. The longitude here is -122.3244, which is slightly east of Seattle's longitude. But considering that coordinates can vary a bit depending on the exact location, this is probably still within Seattle.

Now, Seattle is in the state of Washington. So the state would be Washington. Let me double-check to make sure I'm not confusing it with another city. For example, Portland is in Oregon, but its coordinates are around 45.5231° N, 122.6750° W. The latitude here is higher (47.6 vs 45.5), so that's further north. The longitude is -122.3244, which is west of Portland's longitude. So that's more in line with Seattle's location. 

Another check: looking up the coordinates 47.6211, -122.3244 on a map. If I imagine a map, that's in the northern part of Washington state, near the Puget Sound. Definitely Seattle. So the state is Washington. I think that's correct. No other major cities in that area have those coordinates. So the answer should be Washington.
