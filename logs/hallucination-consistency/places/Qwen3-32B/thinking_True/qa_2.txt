Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 34.1141° N, 118.4068° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which state that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint locations. Let me think about the major cities and their coordinates.

First, the latitude is 34.1141. That's in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is -118.4068, which is in the western hemisphere. I know that Los Angeles is around 34° N latitude and 118° W longitude. Let me confirm that. Los Angeles is a major city in California, right? So if those coordinates are for Los Angeles, then the state would be California. 

Wait, but maybe I should double-check. Sometimes coordinates can be a bit off. Let me recall other cities. For example, San Francisco is further north, around 37° N. So 34° is definitely further south. Maybe San Diego? San Diego is around 32.7° N, so that's lower. So 34.11° N would be between San Diego and Los Angeles. Maybe closer to LA. 

Also, the longitude -118.4° W. Los Angeles is at approximately 118.24° W, so this is a bit west of that. But maybe it's still within the LA area. So the coordinates are likely in Los Angeles, California. Therefore, the state is California. 

I think that's right. Let me see if there's any other state that could be in that area. Arizona is to the east, but the longitude is more like -111 to -112. Nevada is to the north, but longitude there is around -115. So definitely, -118 is in California. Yeah, I'm pretty confident it's California. The exact location might be in Los Angeles County, but the state is definitely California.
