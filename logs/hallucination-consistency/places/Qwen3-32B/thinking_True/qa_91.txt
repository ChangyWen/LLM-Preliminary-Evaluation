Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 41.6638° N, 83.5827° W are located. I need to figure out which state that is.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 41.66 degrees north, and the longitude is 83.58 degrees west. I need to recall which U.S. states are in that general area. 

The longitude of 83.58° W is in the eastern part of the United States. Let me think about the major cities or regions. For example, cities like Cleveland, Ohio are around that longitude. Let me check the approximate coordinates for some states. Ohio's capital is Columbus, which is around 40° N, 83° W. Wait, the latitude here is 41.66, which is a bit north of Columbus. So maybe that's in northern Ohio?

Alternatively, maybe it's in Michigan? But Michigan's longitude is more like 84-85° W for some parts. Let me think. Detroit is around 42.336° N, 83.049° W. So that's a bit north and east. The given coordinates are 41.66° N, which is south of Detroit. So maybe somewhere in Ohio or Michigan?

Wait, another approach: using a map or a geographical tool. Since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on memory. Let me think of the approximate boundaries. Ohio's northern border is near the latitude of 41.5° N? Wait, no. Ohio's southern border is along the Ohio River, which is around 39° N, and its northern border is with Michigan and Indiana, which is around 41.7° N. So if the latitude is 41.66° N, that's just south of Ohio's northern border. Wait, but Ohio's northern border is at Lake Erie. So maybe the coordinates are in northern Ohio, near Lake Erie?

Alternatively, maybe it's in Indiana? Indiana's longitude ranges from about 84.5° W to 87.5° W. The longitude here is 83.58° W, which is more to the east. So that would be in Ohio, not Indiana. 

Another thought: Toledo, Ohio is located at approximately 41.67° N, 83.58° W. Wait, that's almost exactly the coordinates given. So the coordinates are for Toledo, Ohio. Therefore, the state is Ohio.

Let me double-check. Toledo's coordinates are indeed around 41.67° N, 83.58° W. So the place is Toledo, which is in Ohio. Therefore, the answer should be Ohio.
