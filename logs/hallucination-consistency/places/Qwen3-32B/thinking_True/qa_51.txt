Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 35.4676° N, 97.5136° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 35.4676, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -97.5136, which is in the western hemisphere.

I think the United States is in the western hemisphere, so that makes sense. Now, I need to figure out which state. Let me recall some states and their approximate coordinates. For example, Oklahoma's capital is Oklahoma City. I think Oklahoma is in the central part of the US. Let me check the approximate coordinates for Oklahoma. I remember that Oklahoma's latitude ranges from about 33° N to 37° N, and longitude from around 94° W to 103° W. The given latitude is 35.4676, which is within that range. The longitude is -97.5136, which is also within Oklahoma's longitude range. 

Wait, but maybe I should cross-verify. Let me think of other states. Texas is to the south, so its latitude would be lower. Kansas is to the north, so higher latitude. The longitude -97.5 is probably in the central part of Oklahoma. Also, I recall that the exact coordinates for Oklahoma City are around 35.4936° N, 97.5074° W. The given coordinates are 35.4676 and -97.5136, which are very close to Oklahoma City. So that must be in Oklahoma. 

I don't think any other state has coordinates in that range. Let me just make sure. Maybe check if there's a nearby state. For example, Kansas is north of Oklahoma, so if the latitude was higher, say 38°, it would be Kansas. But 35.4 is still within Oklahoma's southern part. The longitude -97.5 is definitely in Oklahoma. So the answer should be Oklahoma.
