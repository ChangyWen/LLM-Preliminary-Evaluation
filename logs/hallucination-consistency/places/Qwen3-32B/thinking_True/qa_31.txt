Okay, let's see. The user is asking which state the coordinates 39.1413° N, 84.506° W are located in. I need to figure that out.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude coordinates can be used to pinpoint a location on the globe. The latitude here is 39.1413, which is in the northern hemisphere since it's positive. The longitude is -84.506, which means it's in the western hemisphere. 

Now, I need to think about the approximate location. The latitude 39 degrees north is somewhere in the mid-latitudes. For the United States, that would put it in the Midwest or maybe the Southeast. The longitude 84.5 degrees west is a bit more specific. Let me recall some key cities or states. 

I know that Cincinnati, Ohio is around 39.1° N and 84.5° W. Wait, that's exactly the coordinates given here. So Cincinnati is in Ohio. But maybe I should double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up any other cities. 

Another way to approach this is to think about the states that are around that latitude and longitude. Ohio's southern border is along the Ohio River, and Cincinnati is a major city there. Indiana is to the east, but the longitude 84.5 W is more westward, so that's likely Ohio. 

I can also consider other cities. For example, Indianapolis is in Indiana, but its coordinates are around 39.7684° N, 86.1581° W, which is further west (higher longitude in the negative direction). So 84.5 W is east of Indianapolis, which would place it in Ohio. 

Another check: looking at a map or using a mental map. If I imagine the US, 39 degrees north is roughly the line that goes through places like Baltimore, MD, and then moves west. At 84.5 W, that's definitely in Ohio. 

I think I'm pretty confident that the coordinates given are in Ohio. To be thorough, maybe I can think of other states. Kentucky is to the south of Ohio, but the latitude 39.14 is still in northern Kentucky? Wait, Kentucky's northern border is the Ohio River, so maybe the coordinates are just north of that, which would be Ohio. 

Yes, so putting it all together, the state is Ohio.
