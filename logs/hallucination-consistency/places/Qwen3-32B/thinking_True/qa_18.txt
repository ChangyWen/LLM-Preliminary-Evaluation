Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 27.9945° N, 82.4447° W are located. First, I need to figure out what place that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be looked up using various tools or maybe even some geographical knowledge.

Starting with the latitude, 27.9945° N. That's just under 28 degrees north. The longitude is -82.4447°, which is 82.44 degrees west. I think the United States has several states in that latitude range. Let me think about major cities or landmarks. Tampa, Florida comes to mind because I know that Tampa's coordinates are around 27.9945° N, 82.4447° W. Wait, that's exactly the coordinates given here. So if that's the case, then the location is Tampa, Florida. Therefore, the state would be Florida. 

But I should double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up any other cities. Let me recall other cities in that area. For example, Orlando is further south, maybe around 28.5 degrees north. Miami is much further south, around 25-26 degrees. So Tampa being at 28 degrees north makes sense. The longitude of 82.44 west also fits with Florida's west coast. So yes, that's Tampa, Florida. Therefore, the state is Florida.
