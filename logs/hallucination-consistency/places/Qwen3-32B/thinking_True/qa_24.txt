Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 45.5371° N, 122.65° W are located. First, I need to figure out what city or area those coordinates point to. I remember that latitude and longitude can be looked up using various tools or databases. Since I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge.

Starting with the latitude 45.5371, that's in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is -122.65, which is in the western hemisphere. Now, I need to think about the states in the United States that are in that general area. The longitude of around 122.65° W is in the Pacific Northwest. States like Oregon and Washington come to mind. Let me narrow it down.

Portland, Oregon is a major city in that region. I think Portland's coordinates are approximately 45.5° N, 122.67° W. Comparing that to the given coordinates: 45.5371 is very close to 45.5, and -122.65 is almost the same as -122.67. So this must be Portland. Now, Portland is in the state of Oregon. Therefore, the state should be Oregon.

Wait, just to be sure, are there any other cities nearby? Maybe in Washington? But Washington's major cities like Seattle are further north, around 47° N. So 45.5° is more southern. That points more towards Oregon. Also, checking the longitude, 122.65° W is indeed in Oregon. So I'm pretty confident the answer is Oregon.
