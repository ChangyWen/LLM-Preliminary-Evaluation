Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 37.5295° N, 77.4756° W are located. First, I need to figure out what place that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be looked up using various tools or maybe even some geographical knowledge.

Starting with the latitude, 37.5295° N. That's in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is -77.4756°, which is 77.4756° W, so western hemisphere. I think the United States has a lot of states in that latitude range. Let me think about major cities or landmarks. 

I recall that Washington, D.C. is around 39° N, 77° W. Wait, the latitude here is 37.5°, which is a bit south of D.C. Maybe somewhere in Virginia? Because Virginia is south of D.C. and has a similar longitude. Let me check. Virginia's latitude ranges from about 36° N to 39° N, and longitude around 75° W to 82° W. So 37.5° N, 77.47° W would be within Virginia's boundaries. 

Alternatively, maybe North Carolina? But North Carolina is a bit further south. Let me think of specific cities. Richmond, Virginia is around 37.54° N, 77.45° W. Oh, that's very close to the given coordinates. So the coordinates are in Richmond, Virginia. Therefore, the state is Virginia. 

Wait, just to be sure, maybe I should confirm. Let me think of other possibilities. Could it be Maryland? Maryland is north of D.C., so probably higher latitude. The given latitude is 37.5, which is lower than D.C.'s 39, so more south. So Virginia makes sense. Also, checking the longitude: 77.4756 W. Since D.C. is at 77.0° W, moving west a bit would be into Virginia. So yes, Richmond is in Virginia. Therefore, the answer should be Virginia.
