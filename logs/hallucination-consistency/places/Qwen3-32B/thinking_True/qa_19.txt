Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 39.762° N, 104.8758° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which state that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint locations. Let me think about the United States.

First, the latitude is 39.762. That's in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is -104.8758, which is in the western hemisphere. So, that's in the western part of the US. Let me recall some major cities and their coordinates. Denver, Colorado comes to mind. I think Denver's coordinates are around 39.7392° N, 104.9903° W. Wait, the given longitude here is -104.8758, which is a bit east of Denver's longitude. But maybe it's still in Colorado? 

Alternatively, maybe it's another city. Let me check. Colorado's capital is Denver, and the coordinates given here are close to Denver. Let me verify. The latitude 39.762 is slightly north of Denver's latitude. But maybe it's a different city in Colorado. For example, Boulder is at around 40.015° N, 105.2705° W. That's a bit north and west. So the given coordinates are between Denver and Boulder? 

Wait, let me think again. The longitude -104.8758 is east of Denver's -104.9903. So moving east from Denver, maybe towards the eastern part of Colorado. Maybe somewhere near Aurora or another city. But regardless, Colorado's longitude ranges from about 102° W to 109° W, so -104.87 is within that range. The latitude 39.76 is also within Colorado's range, which is roughly from 37° N to 41° N. So that would place it in Colorado. 

Alternatively, could it be in Kansas? But Kansas is further east. The longitude of Kansas would be around 94° to 102° W. Wait, no, -104.87 is west of Kansas. So probably not Kansas. Maybe New Mexico? New Mexico is further south, so the latitude would be lower. The coordinates given are around 39.76° N, which is more northern. So New Mexico is around 31° to 37° N, so that's too far south. 

What about Wyoming? Wyoming is north of Colorado. Its latitude ranges from about 40.99° N to 45.0° N. The given latitude is 39.76, which is just south of Wyoming's southernmost point. So probably not Wyoming. 

So putting it all together, the coordinates 39.762, -104.8758 are in Colorado. Let me double-check by maybe recalling some other landmarks. The Denver International Airport is at around 39.8561° N, 104.6737° W. Wait, that's a bit north and east. The given coordinates are a bit south and west of that. So maybe near Denver but slightly towards the west. Still within Colorado. 

I think the answer is Colorado. I don't see any other state that fits those coordinates. Let me confirm once more. If I look up a map or use a geolocation tool, but since I can't do that right now, I'll go with my knowledge. Yes, Colorado.
