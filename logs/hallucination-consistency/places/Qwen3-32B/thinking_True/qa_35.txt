Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 30.3005° N, 97.7522° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 30.3005, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -97.7522, which is in the western hemisphere. 

I think the United States is in the western hemisphere, so that makes sense. Now, I need to recall which states are around that latitude and longitude. Let me think. The latitude 30° N is roughly along the southern part of the U.S., maybe near Texas or Louisiana? Wait, Texas is a big state. The longitude -97.75° W... I remember that the central time zone in the U.S. is around that longitude. Texas is in the central time zone. 

Wait, Austin, Texas. I think Austin's coordinates are around 30.2672° N, 97.7431° W. Oh, that's very close to the given coordinates. So the coordinates 30.3005, -97.7522 are probably in Austin, Texas. Therefore, the state would be Texas. Let me double-check. Maybe I can visualize a map. Texas is south and west of the center of the U.S. So 30° N is about the latitude of San Antonio or Austin. And longitude -97.75 is in central Texas. Yeah, that's definitely in Texas. I don't think any other state has that combination. Maybe check if there's another state nearby. But no, that's Texas. So the answer should be Texas.
