Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 40.5961° N, 75.4756° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 40.5961, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -75.4756, which is in the western hemisphere. 

I think the United States is in the western hemisphere, so that's a start. Now, the latitude 40.5961 is roughly around the 40s, which I know is where places like New York City, Philadelphia, and maybe parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey are. The longitude -75.4756... Let me think. Philadelphia is around 39.9526° N, 75.1652° W. Wait, so the given longitude is -75.4756, which is a bit further west than Philadelphia. That might be in New Jersey? Because New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, but longitude decreases as you go west. Wait, no, longitude west of the prime meridian increases as you go west. So -75.4756 is more west than Philadelphia's -75.1652. So that would be further west, maybe into Pennsylvania? Or maybe into Delaware? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall that New York City is around 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W. So the longitude here is -75.4756, which is more west than NYC. So moving west from NYC, that would be into Pennsylvania. Let me check some approximate coordinates. For example, Harrisburg, PA is around 40.2691° N, 76.8912° W. Wait, that's more west than -75.4756. So maybe somewhere between Philadelphia and Harrisburg? Maybe Allentown, PA? Let me check. Allentown is approximately 40.6167° N, 75.4993° W. Oh, that's very close to the given coordinates. The latitude is 40.5961, which is just a bit south of Allentown's 40.6167. So Allentown is in Pennsylvania. Therefore, the coordinates are in Pennsylvania. 

Wait, but let me make sure. Maybe there's a border area. Allentown is in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. So if the coordinates are near Allentown, that's definitely PA. Alternatively, could it be in New Jersey? But New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania. The longitude -75.4756 is west of Philadelphia, which is in Pennsylvania. So I think the answer is Pennsylvania. Let me confirm with another approach. Maybe using a map or a geolocation tool. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my knowledge. 

Another way: the 40th parallel north passes through the US, and at around 40.5 degrees, that's in the mid-Atlantic region. The longitude -75.4756 is in the eastern US. Given that Philadelphia is at -75.16, and moving west a bit more would be into PA. So yes, the state is Pennsylvania.
