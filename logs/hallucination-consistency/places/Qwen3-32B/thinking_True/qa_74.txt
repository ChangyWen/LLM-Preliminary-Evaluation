Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 35.9692° N, 83.9496° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which state that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint locations. Let me think about the approximate locations.

First, the latitude is 35.9692, which is just a bit south of 36 degrees north. The longitude is -83.9496, which is 83.95 degrees west. I know that the United States spans a range of latitudes and longitudes. Let me recall some key states. For example, Tennessee's coordinates are roughly between 33°N to 37°N and 81.5°W to 89.5°W. So 35.96 is within that range. Let me check if that's in Tennessee. 

Wait, maybe I should cross-reference with other states. North Carolina is to the east, but its longitude is more around 75-80 degrees west. Wait, no, North Carolina's western part is around 82 degrees west. Wait, maybe it's in Tennessee. Let me think of a city. Knoxville, Tennessee is around 35.96° N, 83.94° W. Oh, that's exactly the coordinates given. So Knoxville is in Tennessee. Therefore, the state is Tennessee. 

But wait, let me make sure. Maybe I should check if there's another state nearby. For example, Georgia is to the south, but its longitude is more like 81-85 degrees west. But the latitude for Georgia is lower, around 30-35 degrees north. So 35.96 is a bit north of that. So Tennessee fits better. Also, the longitude 83.95 west is within Tennessee's range. So yes, the answer should be Tennessee.
