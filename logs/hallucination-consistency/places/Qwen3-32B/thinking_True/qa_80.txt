Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 33.6096 latitude and -117.6551 longitude are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location on a map. Let me think about the approximate regions these coordinates might fall into.

The latitude is 33.6 degrees north. That's in the southern part of the United States, maybe somewhere in California, Arizona, or Texas? The longitude is -117.65 degrees, which is west of the Prime Meridian. Let me recall that Los Angeles is around 34 degrees north and 118 degrees west. So 33.6 and -117.65 would be a bit north of LA, maybe in Orange County? Places like Irvine or Santa Ana are in that area. 

Wait, Orange County is in California. So if that's the case, the state would be California. Let me double-check. Maybe I can think of other cities. San Diego is further south, around 32.7 degrees north. So 33.6 is north of San Diego. That puts it in Orange County, which is part of California. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in another state? Let me consider Arizona. Arizona's longitude is more around 111 to 115 degrees west, so -117 is further west, which would be more towards California. Texas is even further east, so longitude there is around -95 to -106, so that's not it. 

Another way to verify: I can think of the coordinates for Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), which is around 33.94° N, 118.40° W. The given coordinates are 33.61° N, 117.66° W, which is east of LAX, so moving towards the east of Los Angeles. That would be in Orange County, maybe near Irvine or Costa Mesa. 

Yes, so Orange County is in California. Therefore, the state should be California. I think that's correct. Let me just confirm if there's any other possible state. Maybe Nevada? But Nevada is more north and east. The longitude of -117 is still in California. So I'm pretty confident the answer is California.
