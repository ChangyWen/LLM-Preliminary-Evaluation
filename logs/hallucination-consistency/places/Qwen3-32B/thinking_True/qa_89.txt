Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 40.5834° N, 74.1496° W are located. Hmm, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. Let me think about the major cities and their coordinates.

First, 40.5834° N is a latitude. The 40th parallel north runs through several places, but in the United States, it's in the Northeast. The longitude -74.1496° W is in the Eastern Time Zone. I know that New York City is around 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W. So this location is a bit south of NYC, maybe in New Jersey? Because the coordinates are west longitude, so moving west from NYC would be into New Jersey.

Wait, let me check. The Hudson River separates New York and New Jersey. So if the longitude is -74.1496, which is west of NYC's longitude (-74.0060), that would place it in New Jersey. The latitude 40.5834 is a bit south of NYC's latitude. So maybe somewhere in northern New Jersey? Like Newark? Newark's coordinates are approximately 40.7389° N, 74.1724° W. Wait, the longitude here is -74.1496, which is east of Newark's longitude. Wait, longitude numbers west of the prime meridian increase as you go west. So -74.1496 is more west than -74.0060. Wait, no, actually, the more negative the longitude, the further west you are. So -74.1496 is further west than -74.0060. So if NYC is at -74.0060, then -74.1496 is further west, which would be into New Jersey. So that would be in New Jersey. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in New York State? But the Hudson River is the boundary. So if it's west of the river, it's New Jersey. Let me confirm. Let me think of another city. Hoboken is in New Jersey, across the river from Manhattan. Hoboken's coordinates are around 40.7484° N, 74.0260° W. Wait, that's actually east longitude compared to the given coordinates. Wait, the given longitude is -74.1496, which is more west than Hoboken's -74.0260. So that would be further west. So maybe somewhere like Paterson, New Jersey? Paterson is around 40.9933° N, 74.2267° W. Wait, that's a bit north and further west. The latitude here is 40.5834, which is lower (south) than Paterson. So maybe somewhere in the Passaic County area? 

Alternatively, maybe it's in New York City's boroughs? But the west side of Manhattan is still New York. Wait, the coordinates given are 40.5834, -74.1496. Let me check an online map. Wait, I can't access the internet, but I can recall that the latitude 40.5834 is approximately the latitude of the southern part of New York City, like around the area of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which connects Brooklyn to Staten Island. But longitude -74.1496 would be west of Manhattan. So if it's west of Manhattan at that latitude, it's in New Jersey. For example, the area around Bayonne, New Jersey is around 40.5834° N, 74.1496° W. Let me check Bayonne's coordinates. I think Bayonne is in Hudson County, New Jersey. If that's the case, then the state would be New Jersey. 

So putting it all together, the coordinates 40.5834, -74.1496 are in New Jersey. Therefore, the answer is New Jersey.
