Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 41.2279 latitude and -111.9682 longitude are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which state that is. First, I remember that the United States is divided into states, and each has specific coordinates. Let me think about the approximate regions.

The latitude 41.2279 is in the northern part of the US. The longitude -111.9682 is quite a high negative value, which means it's in the western part of the country. Let me recall some states in the west. Utah, for example, has coordinates around that area. The capital of Utah is Salt Lake City, which I think is around 40.75 degrees north and 111.89 degrees west. Wait, the given longitude is -111.9682, which is very close to Salt Lake City's longitude. The latitude here is 41.2279, which is a bit north of Salt Lake City's 40.75. But maybe that's still within Utah? 

Alternatively, maybe it's in a neighboring state. Let me check. The state to the north of Utah is Idaho, but Idaho's longitude is more around -116 to -111, so maybe not. To the west of Utah is Nevada, but Nevada's longitude is more like -114 to -117. Wait, no, actually, Utah is between approximately 37°N to 41°N and 112°W to 114°W. The given latitude is 41.2279, which is just a bit north of the northern boundary of Utah. But maybe the state still extends that far north? Let me think. The northernmost point of Utah is around 41.3 degrees north, so 41.2279 is just slightly south of that. So that would still be in Utah. The longitude is -111.9682, which is very close to -112, so that's within Utah's western boundary. 

Another way to check is to use a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. Salt Lake City is in Utah, and the coordinates given are very close to Salt Lake City. Therefore, the state is likely Utah. I don't think there's another state that fits those coordinates. Let me confirm the boundaries again. Utah's northern border is with Idaho, and the longitude there is around -111. So if the longitude is -111.9682, that's just a bit west of the center of Utah's western edge, but still within the state. So yes, the answer should be Utah.
