Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 39.9862° N, 82.9855° W are located. First, I need to figure out what place that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be looked up using various tools or maybe even some geographical knowledge.

Starting with the latitude: 39.9862 degrees north. That's just under 40 degrees north. The longitude is 82.9855 degrees west, which is about 83 degrees west. I think the United States has several states in that latitude range. Let me think about major cities or regions. 

Ohio comes to mind because Columbus, Ohio is around 40° N, 83° W. Let me check that. Columbus's coordinates are approximately 39.9612° N, 83.0000° W. The given coordinates are 39.9862° N, which is slightly north of Columbus, and longitude -82.9855, which is a bit east of 83° W. So that's very close to Columbus. 

Since Columbus is the capital of Ohio, the state would be Ohio. But wait, maybe I should confirm if there are any other states nearby. For example, Pennsylvania is to the east, but the longitude there would be more east (lower numbers), like around 79-80° W. Indiana is to the west of Ohio, so their longitude would be higher (more west, like 86-87° W). So 83° W is definitely in Ohio. 

Another way to check is to use an online map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. The coordinates are very close to the Ohio State University in Columbus, which is in Ohio. Therefore, the state is Ohio.
