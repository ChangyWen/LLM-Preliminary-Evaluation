Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 29.4632° N, 98.5238° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 29.46 degrees north, and the longitude is 98.52 degrees west. 

I think the first step is to determine the general region. The latitude 29.46° N is in the southern part of the United States. Let me recall the major cities and states. Texas comes to mind because it's a large state with a lot of area in the southern part. The longitude 98.52° W is quite far west, which also points towards Texas since it's a western state.

Wait, maybe I should check some key points. For example, San Antonio, Texas is around 29.42° N, 98.49° W. Oh, that's really close to the given coordinates. So if San Antonio is at approximately those coordinates, then the location must be in Texas. Let me confirm the exact coordinates of San Antonio. A quick search in my mind (since I can't actually look it up) tells me that San Antonio's coordinates are roughly 29.42° N, 98.49° W. The given coordinates are 29.4632 and -98.5238, which are just a bit north and west of San Antonio. That still places it within Texas. 

Another way to think about it: Texas spans from around 26° N to 36° N in latitude and from about 93° W to 103° W in longitude. The given latitude is 29.46, which is within that range, and the longitude is 98.52, which is also within Texas's western boundary. So that's consistent. 

I don't think any other states are in that exact area. New Mexico is to the west of Texas, but its eastern longitude is around 103° W, which is further west than 98.52. So 98.52 is still east of New Mexico. Oklahoma is north of Texas, but the latitude here is 29.46, which is more southern than Oklahoma's range. So the only state that fits both the latitude and longitude is Texas. 

Therefore, the coordinates 29.4632, -98.5238 are located in Texas.
