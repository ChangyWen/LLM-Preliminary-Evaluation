Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 43.0642° N, 87.9675° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which state that is. First, I remember that the United States is divided into states, and each has specific latitude and longitude ranges. Let me think about the approximate locations.

Latitude 43 degrees north... Well, the 43rd parallel north passes through several states. For example, it goes through places like New York, Michigan, and maybe Wisconsin. The longitude is 87.9675° W, which is just west of 88 degrees west. I know that Chicago is around 87.62° W, so this location is a bit west of Chicago. That would place it in Illinois or maybe Wisconsin. Wait, Wisconsin's western border is around 89 degrees west, so 87.96 is east of that. So maybe Illinois? But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of some cities. Madison, Wisconsin is around 89.4° W, which is further west. Chicago is in Illinois at about 87.6° W. So 87.96 is just a bit west of Chicago, so that's still Illinois. But wait, maybe it's in Wisconsin? No, because the border between Illinois and Wisconsin is the Mississippi River, but that's further east. Wait, no, the Illinois-Wisconsin border is along the western edge of Illinois. Wait, actually, Illinois is east of Wisconsin. Let me check. The state of Wisconsin is to the east of Minnesota and to the west of Michigan. Illinois is to the east of Wisconsin. Wait, no, Illinois is south of Wisconsin. Let me get this straight. The border between Wisconsin and Illinois is along the western part of Illinois? No, actually, the border between Wisconsin and Illinois is along the western part of Wisconsin and the northern part of Illinois. Wait, no, the Mississippi River forms part of the border between Wisconsin and Illinois. So the western part of Illinois is near the Mississippi River. But the longitude here is 87.96° W, which is east of the Mississippi. So that would be in Illinois. Let me think of another way. Maybe looking at major cities. The coordinates given are 43.0642, -87.9675. Let me try to recall some coordinates. For example, Milwaukee, Wisconsin is around 43.0389° N, 87.9065° W. So that's very close. The given coordinates are 43.0642° N, which is slightly north of Milwaukee's latitude, and longitude -87.9675, which is slightly west of Milwaukee's longitude. So that would place it just a bit north and west of Milwaukee. Since Milwaukee is in Wisconsin, that would mean the coordinates are in Wisconsin. Wait, but I thought earlier that 87.96 is in Illinois. Maybe I confused the states. Let me verify. The longitude of 87.96° W is in the area of Milwaukee, which is in Wisconsin. So the state would be Wisconsin. Therefore, the answer is Wisconsin.
