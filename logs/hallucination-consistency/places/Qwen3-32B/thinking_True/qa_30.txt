Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 40.4397° N, 79.9763° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which state that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. Let me think about the major cities and their coordinates.

First, the latitude is 40.4397. That's in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is -79.9763, which is in the western hemisphere. I know that the United States spans a range of latitudes and longitudes. Let me recall some key points. For example, New York City is around 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W. Pittsburgh is approximately 40.4458° N, 80.0053° W. Wait, the given coordinates are 40.4397 and -79.9763. Comparing that to Pittsburgh's coordinates, they look very similar. The latitude is almost the same, and the longitude is just a bit less west. So maybe that's Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania?

Let me double-check. If I look up the coordinates for Pittsburgh, PA, I find that the city's coordinates are roughly 40.44° N, 80.00° W. The given longitude here is -79.9763, which is 79.9763 degrees west. Since 80.00 is a bit further west, this location is slightly east of Pittsburgh. But maybe it's still within the city or nearby. Alternatively, could it be another city in Pennsylvania? Or perhaps a neighboring state?

Wait, let me consider other possibilities. Ohio is to the east of Pennsylvania, but the longitude would be more like -81 or so. West Virginia is to the south, but the latitude there is lower. So probably Pennsylvania. Let me confirm by checking a map or a geographical database. If I use an online tool or a map service, inputting those coordinates would show the location. Since I can't access external resources, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge.

Another way to think about it: the longitude -79.9763 is approximately 79.98 degrees west. Pittsburgh's longitude is about 80.00, so this is just 0.02 degrees east of Pittsburgh. Each degree of longitude is roughly 69 miles at the equator, but since we're at 40 degrees latitude, the distance per degree longitude is about 69 * cos(40°) ≈ 53 miles per degree. So 0.02 degrees would be about 1 mile. So the location is about a mile east of Pittsburgh's center. That would still be within the city limits or very close by. Therefore, the state is Pennsylvania.
