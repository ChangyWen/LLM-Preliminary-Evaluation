Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 40.2457° N, 111.6457° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which state that is. First, I remember that the United States is divided into states, and each has specific geographic coordinates. Let me think about the latitude and longitude ranges for different states.

Latitude 40.2457 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -111.6457 is in the western hemisphere. The negative longitude means it's west of the Prime Meridian. Now, I need to recall which states are around that area. The longitude of -111.6457 is approximately 111.65 degrees west. Let me think about the major states in the western US. Utah, for example, is around that longitude. The state of Utah's capital is Salt Lake City, which I believe is around 40.75 degrees north and 111.89 degrees west. Wait, the given latitude is 40.2457, which is a bit south of Salt Lake City. So maybe it's still in Utah? Let me check the approximate boundaries of Utah. Utah's northern border is with Idaho and Wyoming, and its southern border is with Arizona and Nevada. The latitude of 40.2457 is roughly between 40 and 41 degrees north. Utah's northern part is around 41 degrees, and the southern part is around 37 degrees. So 40.2457 is within that range. The longitude of -111.6457 is in the central part of Utah. Let me think of other states. Colorado is to the east of Utah, so its longitude would be more east (less negative), like around -105 degrees. Arizona is to the south, so longitude would be around -112 to -114, but latitude would be lower. Wait, Arizona's northern part is around 37 degrees north. So 40 degrees north is probably still in Utah. Another way to check is to think of cities. The coordinates given are 40.2457, -111.6457. Let me see if I can recall any cities there. Maybe Provo? Provo is in Utah, and its coordinates are approximately 40.2417° N, 111.6509° W. Oh, that's very close to the given coordinates. So the place is Provo, Utah. Therefore, the state is Utah. I think that's correct. Let me just confirm the boundaries. Utah's western border is with Nevada, and the longitude -111.6457 is east of Nevada's eastern border, which is around -114 degrees. So yes, that's within Utah. So the answer should be Utah.
