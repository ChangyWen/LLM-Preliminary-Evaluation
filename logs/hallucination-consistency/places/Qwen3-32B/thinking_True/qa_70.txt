Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 34.0378° N, 80.9036° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 34.0378, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -80.9036, which is in the western hemisphere.

I think the first step is to determine the general region. The latitude 34 degrees north is somewhere in the southern United States. For example, cities like Atlanta, Georgia are around 33-34 degrees north. The longitude of 80.9 degrees west... I recall that the eastern United States has longitudes in the 70s to 90s west. So, 80.9 west would be in the eastern part of the US.

Now, let me think of states that are around that area. South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, maybe parts of Virginia? Let me try to narrow it down. The coordinates 34.0378, -80.9036... I can check if there's a major city nearby. Let me think, Clemson University is in South Carolina, and I believe it's around those coordinates. Let me verify. A quick search in my mind: Clemson's coordinates are approximately 34.0378° N, 80.9036° W. So that's in South Carolina. Therefore, the state would be South Carolina.

Wait, but I should make sure there's no other place with similar coordinates. Let me cross-check. For example, Charlotte, North Carolina is around 35.2271° N, 80.8431° W. So that's a bit north and east. The coordinates given are a bit south of Charlotte, so more towards the South Carolina side. Since Clemson is in South Carolina, that's probably the correct state. I don't think there's another state bordering there that would have those coordinates. So I'm pretty confident the answer is South Carolina.
