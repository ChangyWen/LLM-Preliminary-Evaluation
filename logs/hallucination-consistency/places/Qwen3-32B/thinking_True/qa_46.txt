Okay, let's see. The user is asking which state the coordinates 35.8324째 N, 78.6429째 W are located in. First, I need to figure out where those coordinates point to.

I remember that latitude and longitude are used to specify locations on Earth. The latitude here is 35.8324 degrees north, and the longitude is 78.6429 degrees west. To find the state, I should probably convert these coordinates into a place name. 

I think the first step is to recognize that the longitude is west, so it's in the Western Hemisphere. The latitude of around 35.8 degrees north is in the mid-latitudes. Now, the United States spans a range of latitudes and longitudes. Let me think about the approximate regions. 

The longitude of 78.6 degrees west... I recall that the eastern United States has longitudes in the 70s west. For example, cities like Washington, D.C. are around 77 degrees west, and Charlotte, North Carolina is around 80-81 degrees west. Wait, so 78.6 degrees west would be somewhere between those. 

Looking at the latitude, 35.8 degrees north. The southern part of the U.S. is around 30-35 degrees north, so 35.8 is a bit north of that. Let me think of states. North Carolina's latitude ranges from about 34 to 36 degrees north. So 35.8 would be in the northern part of North Carolina. 

But wait, let me check. Maybe it's in Virginia? Virginia's northern part is around 39 degrees, and southern Virginia is around 36-37 degrees. So 35.8 might be just south of Virginia's southern border. Wait, but North Carolina is south of Virginia. So if the latitude is 35.8, that's in the northern part of North Carolina. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in South Carolina? South Carolina's northern part is around 35 degrees north, so 35.8 would be in the northern part of South Carolina. But I need to cross-check the longitude. 

The longitude of 78.6 degrees west. Let me think of major cities. For example, Raleigh, North Carolina is around 35.77 degrees north and 78.64 degrees west. Wait, that's almost exactly the coordinates given. So Raleigh, NC is at approximately 35.7783째 N, 78.6384째 W. The user's coordinates are 35.8324 and -78.6429, which are very close to Raleigh. 

Therefore, the coordinates are in North Carolina. So the state is North Carolina. Let me just confirm. If I look up the coordinates 35.8324, -78.6429, they should point to Raleigh, which is the capital of North Carolina. Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is North Carolina.
