Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 40.0077° N, 75.1339° W are located. I need to figure out which state that is.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude coordinates can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 40.0077, which is just a bit north of 40 degrees. The longitude is -75.1339, which is 75 degrees west. I know that the United States has several states in the 40s latitude range. Let me think about major cities and their coordinates.

Philadelphia comes to mind. I recall that Philadelphia is around 39.9526° N, 75.1652° W. The given coordinates are 40.0077 and -75.1339. Comparing these, the latitude is slightly higher (north) than Philadelphia's, and the longitude is a bit east (since -75.1339 is less west than -75.1652). So maybe this is just a bit north and east of Philadelphia. 

Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania. But wait, could it be in New Jersey? The Delaware River separates Pennsylvania and New Jersey. If the coordinates are just north of Philadelphia, they might still be in Pennsylvania. Let me check the exact location. 

Looking up the coordinates 40.0077, -75.1339, I can use a map or a geolocation service. Alternatively, I can think of nearby landmarks. For example, the coordinates for Philadelphia International Airport are approximately 39.8717° N, 75.2411° W. The given coordinates are north of that. 

Another approach: the latitude 40.0077 is about 40 degrees north, which is in the northern part of the US. The longitude -75.1339 is in the eastern US. States in that area include Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and parts of Maryland. 

Since Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania and the coordinates are just north of there, it's likely still in Pennsylvania. Let me confirm by checking if there's a specific town or area at those coordinates. Maybe the coordinates point to a specific location like a park or a building. 

Alternatively, using an online converter or map tool would help, but since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. Given that the coordinates are very close to Philadelphia, and slightly north, I think the state is Pennsylvania. 

Wait, but maybe it's in New Jersey? The exact boundary between Pennsylvania and New Jersey near Philadelphia is along the Delaware River. If the coordinates are east of the river, it would be New Jersey. However, the longitude -75.1339 is west of Philadelphia's longitude (-75.1652), meaning it's slightly east of Philadelphia. Wait, no: lower longitude values (closer to 0) are east. So -75.1339 is east of -75.1652. So if Philadelphia is at -75.1652, then -75.1339 is east of that, which would be closer to the Delaware River. 

But the latitude is higher (north) than Philadelphia's. So the location is northeast of Philadelphia. That area is still in Pennsylvania, perhaps in the Bucks County area, which is north of Philadelphia. Bucks County is in Pennsylvania, and it's across the Delaware River from New Jersey. So if the coordinates are in Bucks County, it's Pennsylvania. 

Therefore, the state is Pennsylvania.
