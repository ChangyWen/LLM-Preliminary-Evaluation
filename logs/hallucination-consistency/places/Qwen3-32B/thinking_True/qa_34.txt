Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 39.7771° N, 86.1458° W are located. I need to figure out which state that is.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 39.7771, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -86.1458, which is in the western hemisphere. The negative longitude means it's west of the Prime Meridian.

Now, I need to think about the United States. The central time zone is around 90° W, so 86.1458° W is a bit east of that. States in the central part of the US. Let me think. Indiana is around that area. The capital of Indiana is Indianapolis. I think Indianapolis is around 39.7684° N, 86.1581° W. Wait, the given coordinates are 39.7771 and -86.1458. That's very close to Indianapolis. So that would be in Indiana. 

But wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me recall other states. Ohio is to the north, Kentucky to the south, Illinois to the west. So if it's near Indianapolis, that's in Indiana. Also, the latitude 39.77 is roughly around 40° N, which is a line that goes through places like Chicago, but Chicago is more west. So 86° W is more east. So yes, Indianapolis is in Indiana. Therefore, the state is Indiana.
