Okay, let's see. The user is asking which state the location with latitude 31.8476 and longitude -106.43 is in. I need to figure out the state in the US that corresponds to those coordinates.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude are given in decimal degrees. The latitude here is 31.8476° N, and the longitude is -106.43° W. Since the longitude is negative, that means it's west of the Prime Meridian. Now, I need to determine which U.S. state this point is in.

I know that the United States spans a wide range of latitudes and longitudes. Let me think about the approximate regions. The latitude 31.8° N is in the southern part of the U.S. For example, Texas has a latitude range from about 26° N to 36° N, so 31.8° N would be somewhere in the central or southern part of Texas. The longitude -106.43° W is in the western part of the U.S. Texas also extends westward, with longitudes ranging from around 93° W to 106° W. So -106.43° W is near the western edge of Texas, possibly near the New Mexico border.

Wait, but New Mexico's longitude ranges are from about 103° W to 109° W, so -106.43° W is within that range as well. However, the latitude 31.8° N is more southern. Let me check the approximate location. Maybe using a map or a geographical tool would help, but since I can't access external resources, I'll have to rely on my knowledge.

Texas and New Mexico both are in that general area. The Texas Panhandle is more north, so maybe this is in West Texas. The city of El Paso, Texas, is near the New Mexico border and has coordinates around 31.7597° N, 106.4867° W. Comparing that to the given coordinates (31.8476, -106.43), it's very close. The latitude is slightly higher (north) than El Paso, but the longitude is a bit east. So this point is just north and east of El Paso, which is in Texas. Therefore, the state should be Texas.

Alternatively, maybe it's in New Mexico? But New Mexico's southern part is around 31.8° N, but the longitude for southern New Mexico is more like -106.5° W. Wait, the longitude here is -106.43, which is east of -106.5, so that would be more towards Texas. So I think it's in Texas, near the border with New Mexico. Therefore, the answer is Texas.
