Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 36.7335° N, 76.0435° W are located. First, I need to figure out which state that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. Let me start by recalling the approximate regions.

The latitude 36.7335 is in the northern hemisphere, so that's above the equator. The longitude is -76.0435, which is in the western hemisphere, so that's west of the Prime Meridian. Now, the United States spans a range of latitudes and longitudes. Let me think about the states in the eastern part of the US because the longitude is around 76 degrees west. 

North Carolina and Virginia are in that area. The 36th parallel north passes through several states, but I need to be more precise. Let me recall that the latitude 36.7335 is approximately 36 degrees and 44 minutes north. The longitude is about 76 degrees and 2.6 minutes west. 

I think the coordinates might be in North Carolina. Let me check. The eastern part of North Carolina is around 76 degrees west longitude. For example, the city of New Bern is around 35.8 degrees north, so a bit south. Maybe further north? The city of Elizabeth City is around 36.3 degrees north, 76.3 degrees west. The given latitude is 36.73, which is a bit north of Elizabeth City. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Virginia? The southern part of Virginia is around 36-37 degrees north. The longitude in Virginia's eastern part is around 77-78 degrees west. Wait, 76 degrees west is more east than Virginia. So maybe it's in North Carolina. 

Another approach: using a map or a geographical tool. Since I can't access the internet, I have to rely on memory. The coordinates 36.7335, -76.0435. Let me think of the approximate location. The 36th parallel in the US goes through places like San Francisco, but that's on the west coast. Wait, no, the 36th parallel north in the eastern US would be through the Carolinas. 

Let me think of the approximate coordinates for major cities. For example, Raleigh, North Carolina is around 35.77° N, 78.64° W. That's more west (higher longitude). The coordinates given are at 76.04° W, which is more east. So maybe further east in North Carolina. The Outer Banks? Well, the Outer Banks are around 35-36 degrees north, 75-76 degrees west. Wait, 76.04 is a bit west of the Outer Banks. 

Wait, maybe it's in Virginia Beach? Virginia Beach is around 36.85° N, 75.98° W. That's very close. The given latitude is 36.73, which is slightly south of Virginia Beach. The longitude is 76.04, which is a bit east of Virginia Beach's 75.98. So maybe the coordinates are near the border of North Carolina and Virginia? 

Wait, the border between North Carolina and Virginia is around 36.5 degrees north. So 36.73 is north of that, which would be in Virginia. But the longitude is 76.04, which is east. Let me check the approximate longitude for Virginia. Virginia's easternmost point is around 75 degrees west (Chesapeake Bay area), but the western part is around 82 degrees west. So 76 degrees west is in the eastern part of Virginia. 

But wait, the coordinates given are 36.73° N, 76.04° W. If that's in Virginia, then the answer is Virginia. However, I need to be careful. Let me think of another city. For example, Norfolk, Virginia is around 36.85° N, 76.27° W. The given longitude is 76.04, which is east of Norfolk. So maybe it's near the coast of Virginia. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in North Carolina's coastal area. But the state line between NC and VA is at 36.5° N. So 36.73 is in Virginia. Therefore, the coordinates are in Virginia. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the state boundaries can be tricky. Let me confirm. The southern border of Virginia is at 36° 30' N (36.5° N), so any latitude north of that is in Virginia. The given latitude is 36.7335, which is 36° 44' N, so that's definitely in Virginia. The longitude is 76.0435° W, which is in the eastern part of Virginia, near the coast. 

Therefore, the answer should be Virginia.
