Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 42.9018° N, 78.8487° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 42.9018, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -78.8487, which is in the western hemisphere. 

I think the United States is in the western hemisphere, so that's a start. Now, I need to recall which states are around that latitude and longitude. Let me think. The latitude 42.9 degrees north... That's roughly around the same latitude as cities like Buffalo, New York, or maybe Rochester? Wait, New York State is in that area. The longitude -78.8 degrees west... Let me check. I know that New York City is around 74 degrees west, so moving westward, Buffalo is around 78-79 degrees west. So that would place this coordinate in upstate New York.

Wait, let me confirm. If I think of the Finger Lakes region, that's around that area. Also, the coordinates might be near a city like Rochester or maybe even closer to the Pennsylvania border. But New York State definitely spans that longitude range. Let me think if there's another state that could be there. Maybe Pennsylvania? But Pennsylvania's westernmost point is around 79-80 degrees west, but the latitude for Pennsylvania would be lower, like around 40-42 degrees north. Wait, 42.9 is still within New York's northern range. For example, the southern part of New York State is around 40-41 degrees, but the northern parts go up to around 45 degrees. So 42.9 is in the middle. 

Another way to check is to think of the approximate location. If I recall, the coordinates for Buffalo, New York are approximately 42.8864° N, 78.8784° W. That's very close to the given coordinates. So the place in question is probably just a few kilometers away from Buffalo. Since Buffalo is in New York State, the answer should be New York. 

I don't think there's another state nearby with those coordinates. Maybe Ontario, Canada? But the latitude 42.9 is south of the Canadian border. The US-Canada border in that area is around the 45th parallel, so 42.9 is definitely in the US. Therefore, the state is New York.
