Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 38.8674° N, 104.7605° W are located. I need to figure out which U.S. state that is.

First, I remember that the United States is divided into states, and each has specific latitude and longitude ranges. Let me start by recalling the approximate locations. The longitude is -104.7605, which is in the western part of the U.S. because the prime meridian is at 0°, and negative longitudes go west. So, -104.76 is quite far west. States like Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, maybe parts of California or Nevada?

Latitude 38.8674° N is a bit north of the 38th parallel. For example, the 38th parallel runs through places like Virginia, but that's on the east coast. Moving west, the 38th parallel would be in states like California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, etc. Let me think of specific cities or landmarks. Denver, Colorado is around 39.74° N, 104.98° W. Wait, the given latitude is 38.86, which is a bit south of Denver. So maybe somewhere in southern Colorado? Or perhaps in New Mexico? Let me check the approximate coordinates for state boundaries.

Colorado's latitude ranges from about 36.99° N to 41.00° N, and longitude from around 102.05° W to 109.05° W. So 38.86 is within that range. The longitude -104.76 is also within Colorado's range. So that would place it in Colorado. But wait, maybe it's near the New Mexico border? Let me cross-verify. New Mexico's northern boundary is around 36.99° N to 37.00° N? No, actually, New Mexico is south of Colorado. Wait, Colorado's southern border is with New Mexico, so if the latitude is 38.86, that's still north of New Mexico's northern part. New Mexico's northern part is around 37° N, so 38.86 is way north of that. So it's definitely in Colorado.

Alternatively, maybe it's in Utah? Utah's latitude ranges from about 36.99° N to 41.99° N, and longitude from 109.05° W to 114.05° W. The longitude here is -104.76, which is east of Utah's eastern boundary (around 111.5° W maybe?), so probably not Utah. So back to Colorado. Let me check if there's a specific city or area there. Maybe near Colorado Springs? Colorado Springs is around 38.84° N, 104.82° W. Oh, that's very close to the given coordinates. The user's coordinates are 38.8674, -104.7605. Colorado Springs is at approximately 38.84° N, 104.82° W. So the given coordinates are just a bit north and east of Colorado Springs. That would still be in Colorado. Therefore, the state is Colorado.
