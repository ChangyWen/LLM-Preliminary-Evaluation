Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 40.6943° N, 73.9249° W are located. Hmm, I remember that latitude and longitude can pinpoint a specific location. Let me think about these numbers.

First, latitude 40.6943 is in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is -73.9249, which is in the western hemisphere. I know that New York City is around 40.7° N and 73.9° W. Wait, that's very close to these coordinates. So maybe this is in New York City? Let me check the exact location. 

Looking up the coordinates, 40.6943, -73.9249... I think that's in Brooklyn, New York. Specifically, maybe near the Brooklyn Museum or somewhere in that area. Since New York City is in the state of New York, the state would be New York. 

But wait, I should make sure there aren't any other places with similar coordinates. Let me confirm. The coordinates are in Manhattan? No, Brooklyn is part of New York City. So regardless of the borough, the state is still New York. Yeah, I'm pretty confident it's New York State.
