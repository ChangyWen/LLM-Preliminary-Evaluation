Okay, let's see. The user is asking which state the coordinates 33.7628° N, 84.422° W are located in. I need to figure that out.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude coordinates can be used to pinpoint a location on a map. The latitude here is 33.7628, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -84.422, which is in the western hemisphere. So that places it somewhere in the United States, probably in the southeastern part.

I think about the major cities and their coordinates. Atlanta, Georgia comes to mind. I recall that Atlanta's coordinates are approximately 33.7490° N, 84.3880° W. The given coordinates are 33.7628 and -84.422. Comparing these, they're pretty close to Atlanta. The slight differences might be due to rounding or specific landmarks within the city.

Now, considering the states around that area. Georgia is one, and parts of Tennessee or Alabama might be nearby, but given the coordinates, it's more likely Georgia. Let me double-check. If I look up a map or use a geographical database, 33.76° N, 84.42° W should be in Georgia. Also, the longitude being -84.42 is west of the prime meridian, which aligns with the eastern US.

Another way to confirm is to use an online tool or a geographical information system. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. I'm pretty confident that this location is in Georgia, specifically near Atlanta. So the answer should be Georgia.
