Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 44.9635° N, 93.2678° W are located. I need to figure out which state that is.

First, I remember that the United States is divided into states, and each has specific latitude and longitude ranges. Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 44.96 is just a bit north of 45 degrees, which is a significant line. The longitude -93.27 is west of the Prime Meridian, so in the central or eastern part of the US.

I know that Minnesota's capital is Saint Paul, and I think Saint Paul is around those coordinates. Let me check. Minnesota is in the Midwest, bordering Canada to the north. The latitude of 45 degrees is roughly the southern part of Minnesota, but since the given latitude is 44.96, that's just slightly south of 45, so maybe still in Minnesota. The longitude -93.27... I recall that the Mississippi River flows through Minnesota, and Saint Paul is on the west bank of the Mississippi. The longitude for Saint Paul is approximately -93.1, so -93.27 is a bit further west, but still within Minnesota. 

Wait, maybe I should cross-verify. Let me think of other states. Wisconsin is to the east of Minnesota, so its longitudes would be more east (less negative). Iowa is to the south and west. But -93.27 is more west than Iowa's average longitudes. So probably Minnesota. Also, checking the exact coordinates for the state capitol of Minnesota, which is Saint Paul. Let me recall: Saint Paul's coordinates are about 44.95° N, 93.10° W. The given latitude is 44.96, which is very close, and the longitude is -93.27, which is a bit further west. That might still be in Saint Paul or nearby. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a different city. Let me think. The coordinates 44.9635, -93.2678... If I use a map tool, but since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on memory. Another way is to think of the approximate area. Minnesota's northern border is around 49 degrees N, and southern border is around 43 degrees N. So 44.96 is within that range. The western border of Minnesota is around 96-97 degrees W, and the eastern border is around 90 degrees W. So -93.27 is between 90 and 96, so definitely in Minnesota. 

Therefore, the state is Minnesota. I think that's the answer.
