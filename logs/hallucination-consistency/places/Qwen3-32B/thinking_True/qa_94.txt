Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 33.7977° N, 118.167° W are located. First, I need to figure out what place that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. Let me start by recalling some major cities and their coordinates.

Los Angeles comes to mind because I know it's in California, and I think its coordinates are around 34° N, 118° W. But the given latitude is 33.7977, which is a bit south of 34°, so maybe it's still in Los Angeles? Or perhaps another city nearby? Let me check. 

Alternatively, maybe I can break down the numbers. The longitude is -118.167, which is west of the Prime Meridian. The latitude is 33.7977° N, which is north of the equator. Now, California's latitude ranges from about 32° N to 42° N, so 33.8° is within that range. The longitude of -118.17° is in the western part of the US, which would be California as well. 

Wait, but I should be more precise. Let me think of other cities. For example, San Diego is further south, around 32.7° N. So 33.8° is north of San Diego. Maybe somewhere like Long Beach or Santa Ana? Those are in Southern California. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a specific landmark. Let me try to recall. The coordinates 33.7977, -118.167... Hmm. If I convert those to degrees and minutes, maybe that helps. For latitude: 33.7977° is 33° 47.86' N. Longitude: 118.167° is 118° 10.02' W. 

Looking up a map, 33°47' N, 118°10' W... That's in Southern California. Let me think of the major cities. Los Angeles is at approximately 34.0522° N, 118.2437° W. The given coordinates are a bit south and slightly east of LA. So maybe it's in the area of Long Beach or Compton? Or perhaps the coordinates are for a specific place like the Port of Los Angeles or somewhere in the LA basin. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use a reverse geocoding method. If I were to input these coordinates into a service like Google Maps, it would show the exact location. But since I can't do that right now, I need to rely on my knowledge. 

Another approach: The longitude -118.167 is west, so in the US, that's definitely in California. The latitude 33.7977 is about 33.8° N. Let me compare with other cities. For example, San Francisco is around 37.7749° N, which is much further north. So 33.8° is definitely in Southern California. 

So putting it all together, the state is California. The coordinates are in Southern California, likely in Los Angeles County. But the user just wants the state, so the answer should be California.
