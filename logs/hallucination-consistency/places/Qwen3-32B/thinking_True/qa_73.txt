Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 42.1155° N, 72.5395° W are located. I need to figure out which state that is.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 42.1155, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -72.5395, which is in the western hemisphere. So that's in the United States, probably in the northeastern part.

Let me think about the states in that region. New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire... Maybe Connecticut? I need to narrow it down. I know that New York City is around 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W, so that's a bit south and west. Boston is approximately 42.3601° N, 71.0589° W. Wait, the longitude here is -72.5395, which is further west than Boston. So maybe somewhere between Boston and Albany?

Albany, New York, is around 42.6526° N, 73.7562° W. Hmm, the longitude here is -72.54, which is east of Albany. So maybe somewhere in Massachusetts? Let me check. The coordinates given are 42.1155° N, 72.5395° W. Let me compare with some cities. Springfield, Massachusetts is around 42.1014° N, 72.5898° W. That's pretty close. The latitude is almost the same, and the longitude is -72.59, which is just a bit west of the given -72.54. So Springfield is in Massachusetts. Therefore, the coordinates are likely in Massachusetts.

Wait, but let me confirm. Maybe it's in Connecticut? Hartford, Connecticut is around 41.7621° N, 72.6789° W. That's a bit south and west. The latitude here is 42.11, which is north of Hartford. So probably still Massachusetts. Another way to check is to use the fact that Massachusetts borders Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New York to the west, and Vermont and New Hampshire to the north. Given the coordinates, 42.11° N is in the southern part of Massachusetts, maybe near the Connecticut border. But since the longitude is -72.54, which is east of Springfield, maybe it's in western Massachusetts. Let me think of other cities. Amherst, Massachusetts is around 42.3770° N, 72.5194° W. That's a bit north and east. The given coordinates are a bit south of that. So maybe near Springfield. Since Springfield is in Hampden County, Massachusetts, I think the answer is Massachusetts. Alternatively, maybe it's in Connecticut, but given the latitude is higher than Hartford, it's more likely Massachusetts. I'll go with Massachusetts.
