Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 42.9619° N, 85.6562° W are located. I need to figure out which U.S. state that is.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 42.96, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -85.66, which is in the western hemisphere. Since the U.S. is in both the northern and western hemispheres, this makes sense.

Now, thinking about the approximate location. Latitude 42 degrees is somewhere in the mid-latitudes. For example, cities like Chicago are around 41-42 degrees north. The longitude of 85.65 degrees west is a bit further west than Chicago, which is around 87.6 degrees west. Wait, so 85.65 is east of Chicago? Wait, no, longitude numbers increase as you go west. So 85.65 is east of 87.6? Wait, no, longitude is measured from the prime meridian. So a lower number (like 85) is further east compared to a higher number (like 87). So 85.65 is east of 87.6. So if Chicago is around 87.6, then 85.65 would be east of that. So maybe somewhere in Indiana or Ohio? Wait, but let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall that Michigan's longitude ranges. The state of Michigan has two peninsulas. The Lower Peninsula is around 84 to 86 degrees west longitude. For example, Detroit is around 83 degrees west, which is further east. So maybe this coordinate is in Michigan? Let me check. If the longitude is 85.65, that's in the western part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Cities like Kalamazoo or Grand Rapids might be around there. Let me confirm. Kalamazoo's coordinates are approximately 42.3 degrees north and 85.6 degrees west. So 42.96 is a bit north of Kalamazoo. Maybe near Battle Creek or somewhere in that area. So that would be in Michigan.

Alternatively, maybe Ohio? Ohio's western part is near the Indiana border, but Ohio's longitude is more around 80-85 degrees west. Wait, 85.65 is still within the range of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Let me check another way. If I think of the latitude 42.96, that's about 43 degrees north. In the U.S., that's in the northern part of the country. So states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, etc. But longitude 85.65 west is more towards the western part of the Midwest. For example, in Michigan, the longitude ranges from about 82.4 (Detroit) to 88.7 (the western tip of the Upper Peninsula). So 85.65 is in the Lower Peninsula. 

Another way to check is to use a map or a geographical tool. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my knowledge. Let me think of cities. As I mentioned, Kalamazoo is around 42.3, 85.6. The given latitude is 42.96, which is a bit north of Kalamazoo. So maybe near Battle Creek, which is about 42.5 degrees north, 85.4 degrees west. Wait, the longitude here is 85.65, which is slightly west of Battle Creek. So maybe a bit further west. Maybe in the area of Jackson, Michigan? Jackson's coordinates are approximately 42.3 degrees north and 84.3 degrees west. Hmm, that's east. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. 

If the longitude is 85.65, that's west of Kalamazoo's 85.6. So maybe a small difference. Maybe the exact location is in Michigan. Alternatively, maybe in Indiana? Indiana's western part is near 85 degrees west. For example, Fort Wayne is around 41 degrees north, 85 degrees west. But the latitude here is 42.96, which is higher (more north) than Fort Wayne. So maybe in the northern part of Indiana? But Indiana's northern border is with Michigan and Ohio. Wait, the latitude 42.96 is just south of the Lake Michigan shoreline. Lake Michigan borders Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. So if the coordinates are at 42.96, 85.65, that's in the southern part of Lake Michigan's western shore. Let me think: the southern end of Lake Michigan is around Chicago (Illinois), which is about 41.8 degrees north. So 42.96 is north of that. So moving north from Chicago, the latitude increases. So 42.96 would be in the area of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, near the southern part of the state. 

Another approach: the U.S. state that's at around 43°N, 85.6°W. Let me think of the state lines. Michigan's southern border is with Indiana and Ohio. The longitude 85.65 is in the western part of the Lower Peninsula. So yes, that's in Michigan. Therefore, the answer should be Michigan.
