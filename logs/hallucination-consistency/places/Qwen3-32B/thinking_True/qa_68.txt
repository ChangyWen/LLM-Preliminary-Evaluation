Okay, let's see. The user is asking which state the coordinates 32.8168° N, 79.9687° W are located in. First, I need to figure out where those coordinates point to.

I remember that latitude and longitude are used to specify locations on Earth. The latitude here is 32.8168 degrees north, and the longitude is 79.9687 degrees west. Let me think about the approximate regions. The longitude of 79.9687° W is in the eastern part of the United States because the prime meridian is at 0°, and moving west, the U.S. starts around 67° W (like Florida) and goes westward. So 80° W is a bit further west than Florida. 

Now, 32.8° N latitude. The equator is 0°, so 32° N is in the southern part of the U.S. Let me recall some states. For example, Florida's northern part is around 30° N, so 32° N would be a bit north of Florida. Maybe Georgia or South Carolina? Wait, South Carolina's latitude ranges from about 32° N to 35° N. So 32.8° N would be in the southern part of South Carolina. 

But wait, longitude 80° W. Let me check. South Carolina's western part is around 82° W, and the eastern part is around 80° W. So 79.9687° W is just west of 80° W, which would place it in the eastern part of South Carolina. Alternatively, maybe near the coast. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Georgia? Georgia's latitude ranges from about 30° N to 35° N, so 32.8° N would be in the northern part of Georgia. But longitude for Georgia is around 81° W to 85° W. Wait, 79.9687° W is east of Georgia's easternmost points. So maybe it's not Georgia. 

Wait, maybe it's in North Carolina? North Carolina's latitude is from about 33° N to 36° N, so 32.8° N would be just south of North Carolina. So maybe South Carolina. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the Carolinas. Let me think of a specific city. Charleston, South Carolina is around 32.79° N, 79.95° W. Oh, that's very close to the given coordinates. So the coordinates 32.8168, -79.9687 are very near Charleston, South Carolina. Therefore, the state is South Carolina. 

Wait, let me double-check. If Charleston is at approximately 32.79° N, 79.95° W, then the given coordinates are just a bit north and west of that. So still within South Carolina. So the answer should be South Carolina.
