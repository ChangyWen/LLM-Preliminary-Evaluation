Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 39.1238° N, 94.5541° W are located. I need to figure out which U.S. state that is.

First, I remember that the United States is divided into states, and each has specific latitude and longitude ranges. Let me start by recalling the approximate locations. The latitude 39.1238° N is in the mid-latitudes. For longitude, 94.5541° W is in the central part of the country since the prime meridian is at 0°, and moving west, the central time zone is around 90° W. So 94.5° W is a bit further west, maybe in the central or mountain time zones.

Now, thinking about states in the central part of the U.S. Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa... Let me narrow it down. Missouri's capital is Jefferson City, which is around 38.5771° N, 92.1726° W. That's a bit east. Kansas City is in Missouri and Kansas. Wait, Kansas City, Missouri is at approximately 39.0997° N, 94.5786° W. The given coordinates are 39.1238° N, 94.5541° W. That's very close to Kansas City. So Kansas City is actually split between Missouri and Kansas. The coordinates given are just a bit north of the Missouri-Kansas border. But I need to check if that point is in Missouri or Kansas. 

The Kansas City area spans both states. The exact border between Missouri and Kansas runs through the area. The latitude 39.1238° N is just north of the main Kansas City area. Let me check the exact border. The Missouri-Kansas border is along the Kansas River, which is a bit south. So if the coordinates are at 39.1238° N, 94.5541° W, that's in the northern part of Kansas City, which is in Missouri. Wait, no, actually, the Kansas side of Kansas City is north of the Missouri side. Wait, the Kansas River flows through the area, and the border is along that river. So if the coordinates are north of the river, they might be in Kansas. But I need to confirm. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use a map or a geographical database. Since I can't access external resources, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge. Let me think again. The coordinates are 39.1238° N, 94.5541° W. Kansas City, Missouri is at 39.0997° N, 94.5786° W. The given coordinates are slightly north and slightly east of that. The Kansas side of Kansas City is just across the river. The exact border is tricky, but I think that area is in Missouri. Wait, no, the Kansas side is north of the Missouri side. So if the coordinates are north of the main Kansas City area, they might be in Kansas. But I'm a bit confused here. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of other states. The longitude 94.5° W is in the central part of the U.S. Missouri is around 92° W to 95° W, so 94.5° W is within Missouri's longitude range. Kansas is to the west of Missouri, so its longitude would be more like 94° W to 99° W. Wait, but 94.5° W is on the eastern edge of Kansas and the western edge of Missouri. So if the coordinates are at 94.5541° W, that's just west of the Missouri-Kansas border. Wait, longitude decreases as you go east. So 94.5541° W is west of 94.5° W. Wait, no, longitude numbers increase as you go west. Wait, longitude is measured as degrees east or west from the prime meridian. So 94.5541° W is 94.5541 degrees west of the prime meridian. If the Missouri-Kansas border is at around 94.5° W, then 94.5541° W is slightly west of that, meaning it's in Kansas. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The Kansas City area is split between Missouri and Kansas. The exact border is along the Kansas River. The coordinates given are very close to Kansas City. If the longitude is 94.5541° W, and the border is at 94.5° W, then that's 0.0541° west of the border, which is about 6 miles (since 1 degree of longitude is roughly 69 miles at that latitude). So 0.0541° * 69 ≈ 3.7 miles. So that would be just 3.7 miles west of the border, which would place it in Kansas. Therefore, the coordinates are in Kansas. 

Wait, but I thought Kansas City's coordinates are in Missouri. Let me check again. The coordinates for Kansas City, Missouri are approximately 39.0997° N, 94.5786° W. The given coordinates are 39.1238° N, 94.5541° W. So latitude is a bit higher (north), and longitude is a bit east (since 94.5541 is less than 94.5786). Wait, longitude numbers west of the prime meridian get larger as you go west. So 94.5541° W is east of 94.5786° W. So the given coordinates are east of Kansas City, Missouri. Wait, that would place them in Missouri. But earlier calculation suggested that if the border is at 94.5° W, then 94.5541° W is west of that, but if the border is at a different longitude... 

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider that the Missouri-Kansas border in the Kansas City area is along the Kansas River, which is at approximately 94.5° W. If the coordinates are at 94.5541° W, that's 0.0541° west of 94.5°, which would be in Kansas. However, if the actual border is at a different longitude, this might not hold. Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are in Missouri. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's think of other cities or landmarks. For example, the city of Independence, Missouri is at 39.0311° N, 94.3293° W. That's east of the given coordinates. The coordinates given are further west. Wait, no, 94.5541° W is west of 94.3293° W. So moving west from Independence, Missouri, we get to Kansas City. So if the coordinates are at 94.5541° W, that's in the Kansas City area. Since Kansas City is split between Missouri and Kansas, the exact state depends on the specific location. 

Given that the coordinates are 39.1238° N, 94.5541° W, which is very close to the coordinates of Kansas City International Airport (MCI), which is in Missouri. The airport's coordinates are approximately 39.1238° N, 94.5541° W. So that would place it in Missouri. Therefore, the answer is Missouri.
