Okay, let's see. The user is asking which state the coordinates 33.5279° N, 86.7971° W are located in. I need to figure that out.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 33.5279, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -86.7971, which is in the western hemisphere. So that places it somewhere in the United States, probably in the southeastern part.

I think the next step is to recall some major cities or states in that area. Let me think. Alabama's latitude ranges from about 30°N to 35°N, and longitude from around 85°W to 88°W. So 33.5°N is roughly in the middle of Alabama's latitude range. The longitude -86.8°W is also within Alabama's range. 

Wait, maybe it's Birmingham? I remember that Birmingham, Alabama is around 33.52°N, 86.80°W. The coordinates given are 33.5279 and -86.7971, which are very close to Birmingham. So if Birmingham is in Alabama, then the state would be Alabama. 

Let me double-check. Maybe I can cross-reference with other states. Georgia is to the east of Alabama, but its longitude is a bit more east (less negative). Tennessee is to the north, so higher latitude. So yes, Alabama fits here. 

I can also think of other cities. For example, Montgomery, the capital of Alabama, is around 32.37°N, 86.29°W, which is a bit south. Tuscaloosa is around 33.21°N, 87.57°W, which is west. So Birmingham is in between. The given coordinates are very close to Birmingham's coordinates, so that's a good indicator. 

Therefore, the state should be Alabama.
