Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 39.3051° N, 76.6144° W are located. First, I need to figure out what place that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be looked up using various tools or maybe even some geographical knowledge.

Starting with the latitude, 39.3 degrees north. That's in the mid-latitudes, probably in the United States. The longitude is 76.6 degrees west. The western hemisphere. Let me think about U.S. states. The eastern part of the U.S. has longitudes around that range. For example, New York City is around 40.7° N, 74° W. So 76.6° W is a bit further west than NYC. Maybe somewhere in Pennsylvania or Maryland? Wait, Baltimore is around 39.29° N, 76.61° W. Oh, that's very close to the given coordinates. So that would be Baltimore, Maryland. Therefore, the state is Maryland. Let me double-check. If I recall correctly, Maryland's coordinates range from about 38° N to 39.8° N and 74.8° W to 79.5° W. The given latitude is 39.3, which is within that range, and the longitude is 76.6, which is also within Maryland's range. So yes, that's in Maryland. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe using a map or a geolocation tool would confirm, but based on my knowledge, it's Baltimore, Maryland.
