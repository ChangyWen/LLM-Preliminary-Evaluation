Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 43.168° N, 77.6162° W are located. First, I need to figure out what place that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be looked up using various tools or databases. Since I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge.

Starting with the coordinates: 43.168° N is the latitude, which is in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is -77.6162°, which is in the western hemisphere. Now, I need to think about the regions where these coordinates might fall. The latitude 43° N is a bit north of the 40th parallel, which runs through places like New York City, but this is further north. The longitude -77.6° W is west of the prime meridian, so in the eastern United States. 

I recall that New York State has a latitude range roughly from 40° N to 45° N and longitude from around 71° W to 79° W. So 43.168° N and -77.6162° W would be within New York State. But maybe it's in a specific city? For example, Rochester, New York is around 43.16° N, 77.61° W. Wait, that's almost exactly the coordinates given. So the place is Rochester, New York. Therefore, the state is New York. 

I should double-check if there are any other states that might be in that area. Maybe Vermont or Pennsylvania? But Vermont is more to the east and north, with higher latitudes. Pennsylvania is more south and east. The longitude -77.6 is still within New York's western part. So yes, it's definitely New York State.
