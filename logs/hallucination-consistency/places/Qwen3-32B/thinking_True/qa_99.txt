Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 33.2175° N, 97.1418° W are located. First, I need to figure out which state that is. I remember that the United States is divided into states, and each has specific latitude and longitude ranges.

Starting with the latitude: 33.2175° N. That's in the southern part of the US. States like Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and maybe parts of California come to mind. But the longitude is -97.1418° W. Let me think about the central time zone. The central meridian for the Central Time Zone is around 90° W, so moving west from there, 97° W would be further west. Texas is a large state that spans several degrees of longitude. The longitude of -97° W is probably in the central or western part of Texas. 

Wait, Dallas is around 32.7767° N, 96.7970° W. So Dallas is a bit east of -97° W. Maybe somewhere west of Dallas? Let me check. The coordinates given are 33.2175° N, which is a bit north of Dallas. So if Dallas is at 96.7970° W, then 97.1418° W is about 0.35 degrees west of Dallas. That would place it in the area around Fort Worth or maybe even further west. But Fort Worth is still in Texas. 

Another way to think about it: Texas's longitude ranges from about 93° W to 106° W, so 97° W is well within Texas. The latitude of 33.2° N is in the northern part of Texas. So putting it all together, the coordinates should be in Texas. Let me confirm by checking a map or using a geolocation tool. If I plug in those coordinates into a map service, it should show a location in Texas. For example, the city of Duncanville, Texas is around 32.95° N, 96.85° W, which is a bit south and east. Moving north to 33.2° N and west to 97.14° W would be in the area near the city of Hurst or Euless, which are part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area but still in Texas. 

I don't think it's in Oklahoma because Oklahoma is to the north of Texas, and the latitude there is higher. For example, Oklahoma City is around 35.49° N, 97.51° W. The longitude is similar, but the latitude is higher. Since our coordinates are 33.2° N, that's lower (more southern) than Oklahoma City, so it's definitely in Texas. 

Therefore, the state is Texas.
