Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 35.2083° N, 80.8303° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 35.2083, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -80.8303, which is in the western hemisphere.

I think the United States is in the western hemisphere, so that makes sense. Now, I need to figure out which state. Let me recall some major cities and their coordinates. For example, Charlotte, North Carolina is around 35.2271° N, 80.8431° W. Wait, that's very close to the given coordinates. The latitude here is 35.2083, which is just a bit south of Charlotte's latitude. The longitude is -80.8303, which is slightly east of Charlotte's longitude. So maybe this is near Charlotte?

If that's the case, then the state would be North Carolina. Let me double-check. Another way is to think about the approximate location. The latitude 35° N is roughly the line that goes through the southern part of the U.S., like Texas, but longitude 80° W is more east. States like North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia are around that longitude. Since 35° N is a bit north of the 35th parallel, which runs through places like California, but in the east, 35° N would be in North Carolina. 

Also, I remember that the city of Charlotte is a major city in North Carolina, and its coordinates are very close to the ones given. The slight differences in the decimal points might just be a more precise location within the city or nearby area. So putting it all together, the coordinates 35.2083, -80.8303 are in North Carolina. I think that's the correct answer. Let me confirm with another method. Maybe using a map or a geographical database. If I can't access that, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge. Yes, I'm pretty confident it's North Carolina.
