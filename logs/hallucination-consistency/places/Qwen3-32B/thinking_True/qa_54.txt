Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 32.7817° N, 97.3474° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 32.78 degrees north, and the longitude is 97.35 degrees west. 

I think the United States is divided into states, and each state has specific coordinates. Let me recall some major cities and their coordinates. For example, Dallas, Texas is around 32.78° N, 96.80° W. Wait, the longitude here is 97.3474, which is a bit further west than Dallas. But Dallas is in Texas, so maybe this is also in Texas? 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Oklahoma? Oklahoma is to the north of Texas. Let me check the approximate coordinates for Oklahoma City. I think Oklahoma City is around 35.49° N, 97.51° W. That's a bit north and west. The given latitude is 32.78, which is lower (more southern) than Oklahoma City. So maybe it's in southern Oklahoma? But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the Texas Panhandle. The Panhandle is the northern part of Texas, which borders Oklahoma. The coordinates given are 32.78° N, which is still within Texas, perhaps in the northern part. For example, Amarillo is around 33.99° N, 102.33° W, which is further north and west. So 32.78° N is more southern. Maybe somewhere like Fort Worth? Fort Worth's coordinates are approximately 32.7555° N, 97.3306° W. Oh, that's very close to the given coordinates. The longitude is -97.3474, which is almost the same as Fort Worth's -97.3306. So Fort Worth is in Texas, so this must be Texas. 

But wait, could there be a border area? Maybe near the Texas-Oklahoma border? Let me verify. The latitude 32.78° N is just south of the 33rd parallel. Oklahoma's southern border is around 33.7° N to 36.5° N, but the southern part of Oklahoma is around 33.5° N. So 32.78 is south of that, so it's in Texas. Therefore, the coordinates are in Texas. 

Another way to check is to use an online map or a geographical tool, but since I can't access that right now, I have to rely on my knowledge. Fort Worth's coordinates are very close to the given ones, so it's safe to say that the location is in Texas. Therefore, the state is Texas.
