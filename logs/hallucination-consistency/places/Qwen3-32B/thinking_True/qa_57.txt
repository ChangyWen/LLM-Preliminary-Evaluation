Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 26.2252째 N, 98.2467째 W are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which state that is. First, I remember that the United States spans a range of latitudes and longitudes. Let me think about the approximate locations.

Latitude 26 degrees north is pretty far south. The southernmost states in the US are Florida, Texas, and maybe Louisiana. But longitude 98 degrees west is in the central part of the country. Wait, Texas is a big state that stretches from around 26 degrees north (the southern tip) up to about 36 degrees north. The longitude of 98 degrees west is in the western part of Texas, maybe near the Rio Grande? Because the Rio Grande forms part of the Texas-Mexico border, and that area is around that latitude. 

Let me check some key points. The city of Brownsville, Texas is near the southern tip of Texas. Its coordinates are approximately 25.9058째 N, 97.5123째 W. So that's a bit south of 26.2252 and east of 98.2467. So the given coordinates are a bit north and west of Brownsville. That would still be in Texas, maybe near the border with Mexico. 

Another way to think about it: the longitude 98 degrees west is in the central time zone. Texas is in the central time zone, so that fits. Also, the latitude 26 degrees north is just a bit north of the southernmost point of Texas. So the location is likely in the southern part of Texas, near the Rio Grande. 

I don't think it's in any other state. For example, New Mexico is further west, around 106 degrees west. Louisiana is further east, around 91 degrees west. So 98 degrees west is definitely in Texas. Therefore, the state should be Texas.
