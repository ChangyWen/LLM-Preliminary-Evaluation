Okay, let's see. The user is asking which state the coordinates 38.6359° N, 90.2451° W are located in. I need to figure that out.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 38.6359, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -90.2451, which is in the western hemisphere. So that places it somewhere in the northern part of the United States, probably in the Midwest or something.

I think the key is to figure out which state this coordinate falls into. Let me recall some major cities and their coordinates. For example, St. Louis, Missouri is around 38.6270° N, 90.1994° W. Wait, the given coordinates are 38.6359 and -90.2451. That's pretty close to St. Louis. So if St. Louis is in Missouri, then the coordinates might be in Missouri. But I should double-check.

Another way is to use the approximate latitude and longitude ranges for states. Missouri's latitude ranges from about 36° N to 40° N, and longitude from around 89° W to 95° W. The given longitude is -90.2451, which is within Missouri's range. The latitude 38.6359 is also within Missouri's range. So that seems to fit.

But wait, could it be in Illinois? St. Louis is on the border of Missouri and Illinois. The Mississippi River runs through there. Let me check the exact coordinates. If the longitude is -90.2451, which is west of the river. The river is roughly around -90.19° W. So if the coordinates are west of the river, that would be Missouri, and east would be Illinois. Since the longitude is -90.2451, which is further west than St. Louis's longitude of -90.1994, that would place it in Missouri. So the location is in Missouri.

Alternatively, maybe I can use an online tool or a map to confirm, but since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. I think the answer is Missouri. Let me just make sure there's no other state nearby with similar coordinates. For example, parts of Kentucky are near that latitude, but the longitude is more west, so Kentucky is further east. So no, it's definitely Missouri.
