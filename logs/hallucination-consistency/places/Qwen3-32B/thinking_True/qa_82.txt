Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 42.2705° N, 71.8079° W are located. First, I need to figure out what location these coordinates correspond to.

I remember that latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint exact locations on Earth. The latitude here is 42.2705, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -71.8079, which is in the western hemisphere. So that places it somewhere in the northern part of the United States, probably in the Northeast.

Let me think about the major cities and their coordinates. Boston, Massachusetts is around 42.3601° N, 71.0589° W. The given latitude is 42.2705, which is a bit south of Boston's latitude. The longitude is -71.8079, which is west of Boston's longitude. So maybe it's a bit further west and south of Boston. 

Wait, maybe it's in Worcester, Massachusetts? Let me check. Worcester's coordinates are approximately 42.2633° N, 71.8022° W. That's very close to the given coordinates. So that would be in Massachusetts. But I should confirm if there's any other state nearby that could be a possibility. 

Looking at the map, Massachusetts is bordered by New Hampshire to the north, Vermont to the northwest, New York to the west, Connecticut to the south, and Rhode Island to the southeast. The coordinates given are in the central part of Massachusetts, near Worcester. So the state should be Massachusetts. 

I can also use an online tool or a geographical database to verify, but since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. The coordinates are very close to Worcester, so I'm pretty confident the state is Massachusetts.
