Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 32.1541° N, 110.8787° W are located. Hmm, first, I need to figure out which country or region this is in. Latitude 32 degrees north and longitude 110 degrees west. Let me recall some geography.

The longitude 110 degrees west is in the western hemisphere. The United States has a lot of states in that range. Let me think about the states in the southwestern US. Arizona, New Mexico, maybe parts of California? Wait, 32 degrees north is a bit south of the 35th parallel, which is the southern boundary of California. So maybe Arizona or New Mexico?

Wait, the longitude 110 degrees west is in the area of Arizona. For example, Phoenix, Arizona is around 33.4484° N, 112.0740° W. So 110.8787° W is a bit east of Phoenix. Maybe near Tucson? Tucson is around 32.1554° N, 110.9768° W. Oh, the given coordinates are 32.1541° N, 110.8787° W. That's very close to Tucson, Arizona. So the state would be Arizona.

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe it's in Mexico? The latitude 32 degrees north in Mexico would be in the northern part, like Chihuahua or Sonora. But longitude 110 degrees west in Mexico is in Baja California Sur or maybe Sonora. However, the coordinates given are 32.1541° N, 110.8787° W. Let me check if that's in the US or Mexico. The border between the US and Mexico is around 32 degrees north in some places. For example, the border between Arizona and Sonora, Mexico is along the Gila River, which is roughly around 32 degrees north. So if the coordinates are just south of that, it would be in Mexico. But Tucson is in Arizona, so if the coordinates are in Tucson, then it's in the US.

Wait, the longitude 110.8787° W is east of 112° W, which is Phoenix. So moving east from Phoenix, towards Tucson. Let me check the exact coordinates. If Tucson is at 32.1554° N, 110.9768° W, then the given coordinates are slightly west of Tucson's longitude. So 110.8787 is west of 110.9768, meaning it's a bit west of Tucson. So maybe still in Arizona? Because the longitude 110.8787 is still within Arizona's boundaries. Let me confirm. Arizona's western boundary is around 114.8 degrees west, and the eastern boundary is around 109 degrees west. So 110.8787 is within Arizona's longitude range. Therefore, the coordinates are in Arizona. So the answer should be Arizona.
