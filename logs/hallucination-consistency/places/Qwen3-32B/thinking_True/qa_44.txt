Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 40.7776° N, 111.9311° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which state that is. First, I remember that the United States is divided into states, and each has specific geographic coordinates. Let me think about the latitude and longitude ranges for different states.

Latitude 40.7776 is approximately 40.8 degrees north. That's a bit north of the 40th parallel, which runs through places like New York City and Salt Lake City. The longitude is -111.9311, which is about 111.9 degrees west. Now, the negative longitude means it's west of the Prime Meridian. 

I know that the western United States has longitudes in the 110s and 120s west. For example, Utah's longitude ranges from about 111°W to 114°W, and its latitude is roughly between 37°N and 41°N. The given latitude of 40.8 is within that range. So maybe Utah? Let me cross-check. Salt Lake City is in Utah, and its coordinates are around 40.75° N, 111.89° W. Wait, the coordinates given here are 40.7776 and -111.9311. That's very close to Salt Lake City. So that would place it in Utah. 

But I should make sure there aren't other states nearby. For example, Idaho is to the north of Utah, but its longitude would be more west, like 114-117°W. Nevada is to the east of Utah, but its longitude is around 114-118°W as well. So 111.9°W is definitely in Utah. Also, the latitude 40.8°N is within Utah's range. 

Another way to check is to recall that the 40th parallel north passes through the middle of Utah. So 40.77 is just a bit north of that. So combining both coordinates, it's likely Salt Lake City in Utah. Therefore, the state should be Utah.
