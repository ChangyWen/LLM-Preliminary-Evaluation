Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 39.7805° N, 84.2003° W are located. I need to figure out which state that is.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 39.7805, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -84.2003, which is in the western hemisphere. The negative longitude means it's west of the Prime Meridian.

Now, I need to think about the approximate location. The latitude 39.78 is around 39 degrees and 47 minutes north. That's in the mid-latitudes of the United States. The longitude 84.20 is 84 degrees and 12 minutes west. I recall that the central part of the U.S. has longitudes in that range. 

Let me think of some states. Ohio's capital is Columbus, and I think Columbus is around 40° N latitude and 83° W longitude. Wait, the given latitude is 39.78, which is just south of 40°, so maybe Columbus is a bit north of this point. The longitude here is 84.20, which is a bit west of Columbus's 83°. So maybe this location is in Ohio but a bit south and west of Columbus?

Alternatively, could it be in Indiana? Indiana is east of Ohio, but the longitude would be more like 85-86° W. Wait, no, Indiana is east, so longitudes would be more east (smaller numbers). Wait, longitude decreases as you go east. So 84.20° W is west of Columbus, Ohio. So maybe this is in a neighboring state? Or maybe still Ohio.

Another approach: I can think of major cities. For example, Cincinnati, Ohio is around 39.1° N, 84.5° W. So Cincinnati's latitude is 39.1, which is a bit south of 39.78. The longitude is 84.5, which is west of 84.20. So the given coordinates are north of Cincinnati and east of its longitude. So maybe somewhere in southern Ohio, near the Indiana border? Because Indiana is to the east of Ohio, but the longitude would be less (more east). Wait, if the longitude is 84.20, which is west of Cincinnati's 84.5, then it's east of Cincinnati? Wait, no. Wait, longitude numbers decrease as you go east. So 84.20 is east of 84.50? No, wait, lower numbers are further east. So 84.20 is east of 84.50. So if Cincinnati is at 84.5, then 84.20 is east of that. So the location is east of Cincinnati, which is in Ohio. So maybe near the Ohio-Indiana border? Because Indiana is east of Ohio. So if the coordinates are 39.78° N, 84.20° W, that's in Ohio, near the Indiana line. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Kentucky? But Kentucky is south of Ohio. The latitude 39.78 is in Ohio, as Cincinnati is at 39.1, and Columbus is at 40° N. So 39.78 is between those two, so in southern Ohio. 

I think the answer is Ohio. Let me check if there's any other state that could be there. Maybe Indiana? But Indiana's longitudes are more like 84.5 to 87.5° W. Wait, no, Indiana is east, so longitudes would be from around 84.5 to 87.5? Wait, no, longitude decreases as you go east. The westernmost point of Indiana is around 87.5° W, and the easternmost is around 84.5° W. So 84.20° W is east of Indiana's eastern border, which would be in Ohio. Therefore, the coordinates are in Ohio, near the Indiana border. 

So the state is Ohio.
