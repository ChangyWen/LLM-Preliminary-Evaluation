Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 40.7834° N, 73.9662° W are located. Hmm, I remember that latitude and longitude can pinpoint a specific location. Let me think. The latitude 40.7834 is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude -73.9662 is in the western hemisphere. I think that area is in the northeastern United States.

Wait, New York City comes to mind. The coordinates for New York City are around 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W, which is Manhattan. But the given coordinates here are a bit different. Let me check. 40.7834 is a bit north of 40.7128, so maybe it's in the northern part of New York City? Like maybe upstate? No, wait, New York City is in New York State. But maybe it's in a different state? Let me think. The coordinates 40.7834, -73.9662... I can use a map or a geolocation tool. Alternatively, I can recall that the Empire State Building is at around 40.7484° N, 73.9856° W. So the given coordinates are a bit north and east of that. Maybe in the Bronx? The Bronx is part of New York City, so still New York State. Wait, but maybe it's in a neighboring state? Like New Jersey? No, New Jersey is across the Hudson River, so the coordinates would be more like 40.7° N but longitude around -74.0 or so. Wait, the longitude here is -73.9662, which is east of Manhattan. So that's still within New York City. So the state would be New York. But let me confirm. Maybe it's in a different area. Let me think of other cities. Maybe it's in New Jersey? But I don't think so. The longitude -73.9662 is east of Manhattan, so that's still New York. So the state is New York. Therefore, the answer should be New York.
