Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 38.9047° N, 77.0163° W are located. Hmm, I remember that latitude and longitude can pinpoint a specific location. Let me think. The latitude is 38.9047, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -77.0163, which is in the western hemisphere. 

First, I should figure out which country this is. The negative longitude suggests it's west of the Prime Meridian. The 38-39 degree latitude in the northern hemisphere and around 77 degrees west... I think that's in the United States. Specifically, the coordinates might be in the eastern part of the US. 

I recall that Washington, D.C. is around those coordinates. Let me check. The capital of the United States, Washington, D.C., is located at approximately 38.9072° N, 77.0369° W. The given coordinates are 38.9047 and -77.0163, which are very close to that. So that would place it in Washington, D.C. But wait, Washington, D.C. isn't a state; it's a federal district. However, the question asks for the state. Since D.C. is not a state, maybe the user is expecting the nearest state. But actually, the coordinates are within the District of Columbia itself. 

Wait, but maybe I should confirm. Let me think of other possibilities. Virginia is to the south and west of D.C., and Maryland is to the north and east. If the coordinates are in D.C., then the answer would be that it's in the District of Columbia, not a state. However, sometimes people might refer to the surrounding states when talking about D.C. But the question specifically asks for the state. Since D.C. is a federal district, not part of any state, the correct answer would be that it's in the District of Columbia. But the user might be expecting a state, so maybe I should mention that it's in D.C., which is not a state. Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are slightly off and actually in a neighboring state. Let me double-check the exact coordinates. 

Looking up the exact coordinates for Washington, D.C., the center is around 38.9072° N, 77.0369° W. The given coordinates are 38.9047 and -77.0163. That's a bit to the southeast of the exact center. But still, that's within the boundaries of Washington, D.C. So the answer is the District of Columbia. However, since the user asked for the state, and D.C. isn't a state, maybe the answer is that it's in the District of Columbia, which is a federal district. But the user might not know that and just wants the state. In that case, perhaps the answer is that it's in the District of Columbia, which is not a state. Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are in a neighboring state. Let me check a map or a geolocation tool. 

Alternatively, I can use the fact that 38.9047, -77.0163 is the location of the White House. The White House is in Washington, D.C. So the answer is the District of Columbia. Therefore, the state is not applicable, but the federal district is D.C. So the correct answer is that it's located in the District of Columbia, which is not a state. But the user asked for the state. Maybe the answer is that it's in the District of Columbia, which is a federal district, not part of any state. However, the user might be expecting the answer as "District of Columbia" even though it's not a state. So I should state that it's in the District of Columbia, which is a federal district, not a state. But the question specifically says "state," so perhaps the answer is that it's in the District of Columbia, which is not a state. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the coordinates are actually in a state. Let me verify once more. 

Yes, the coordinates 38.9047, -77.0163 are indeed in Washington, D.C. So the answer is the District of Columbia. Since the user asked for the state, the correct response is that it's in the District of Columbia, which is a federal district, not a state. But if the user is expecting a state, perhaps they are mistaken, but the accurate answer is the District of Columbia.
