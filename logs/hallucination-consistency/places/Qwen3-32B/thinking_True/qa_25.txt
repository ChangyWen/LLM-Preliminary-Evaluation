Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 33.9381° N, 117.3949° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 33.9381, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -117.3949, which is in the western hemisphere. 

I think the first step is to determine the general area. The latitude 33.9381 is approximately 33 degrees and 56 minutes north. That's in the southern part of the United States, maybe California or Texas? But the longitude is -117.3949, which is around 117 degrees west. Let me recall, the prime meridian is 0°, so moving west, 117° would be in the western US. 

California's longitude ranges from about 114°W to 124°W, so 117°W is within that range. Texas is more east, around 93°W to 106°W, so probably not Texas. So maybe California? But let me check more precisely. 

I can think of major cities. For example, Los Angeles is around 34.0522° N, 118.2437° W. The given longitude is -117.39, which is east of LA. So maybe San Diego? San Diego's coordinates are approximately 32.7157° N, 117.1611° W. Wait, the given latitude is 33.9381, which is a bit north of San Diego. Let me see. Maybe somewhere between LA and San Diego? 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Orange County. Let me think. The coordinates 33.9381, -117.3949. Let me check if that's near any major cities. Maybe Irvine? Or maybe somewhere near the 55 Freeway? Alternatively, maybe it's in the area of Lake Mathews or somewhere in that vicinity. 

Alternatively, I can use the fact that in the US, the 117°W longitude line passes through California. Let me confirm. If I recall, the state boundaries: California's eastern boundary is the 120°W line with Nevada, but actually, no, California's eastern border is with Nevada at the 114°W to 120°W line? Wait, no, California's eastern border is with Nevada at the 114°W to 120°W? Wait, actually, California's eastern boundary is the 120°W line from the 32°30'N latitude north to the 35°N latitude, then it follows the 35°N line east to the 114°W, then south along the 114°W to the 32°30'N. So the longitude -117.39 is between 114°W and 120°W, so definitely in California. 

Therefore, the state is California. But let me make sure. Let me think of another way. Maybe using a map or a tool. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my knowledge. 

Another approach: The coordinates given are 33.9381° N, 117.3949° W. Let me convert that to degrees and minutes for better understanding. 33.9381° N is 33° 56.286' N. Similarly, 117.3949° W is 117° 23.694' W. 

Looking at a map of California, the latitude 33.9° N is just north of San Diego, which is around 32.7° N. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, San Diego is at 32.7° N, so 33.9° N is further north. Let me think. The latitude 34° N is about the latitude of Los Angeles. So 33.9° N is just south of LA. So maybe in Orange County? 

If the longitude is 117.39° W, which is 117° 23' W. San Diego is at 117.16° W, so this is a bit west of San Diego. Wait, no, longitude decreases as you go east. Wait, San Diego is at 117.16° W, so 117.39° W is further west, meaning more towards the Pacific Ocean. But San Diego is already on the coast. So maybe this is offshore? No, probably not. Maybe it's a typo? Or maybe I'm miscalculating. 

Wait, San Diego's longitude is 117.16° W, so 117.39° W is about 0.23° west of San Diego. That's roughly 13 miles west. But San Diego is on the coast, so 13 miles west would be in the ocean. That can't be right. Maybe the coordinates are in California but inland? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Let me check again. 

Wait, longitude is measured east-west. A lower longitude (closer to 0) is east, higher is west. So 117.39° W is west of 117.16° W. So if San Diego is at 117.16° W, then 117.39° W is west of San Diego, which would be in the ocean. That doesn't make sense. Unless the coordinates are in a different state. Wait, maybe I got the longitude wrong. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe I confused the direction. If the longitude is -117.39, that's 117.39° west. So moving west from the prime meridian. So if San Diego is at 117.16° W, then 117.39° W is slightly further west. But San Diego is on the coast, so that would be in the Pacific. Therefore, maybe the coordinates are actually in Baja California, Mexico? But the user is asking for a US state. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the coordinates. Let me check another city. For example, Los Angeles is at 118.24° W. So 117.39° W is east of LA. So between LA and San Diego. Wait, if San Diego is at 117.16° W, then 117.39° W is west of San Diego but east of LA? No, wait, longitude decreases as you go east. So 117.39° W is west of 117.16° W. So if San Diego is at 117.16° W, then 117.39° W is west of San Diego, which would be in the ocean. That can't be. 

Wait, maybe the coordinates are in California but not near the coast. Let me think. Maybe the coordinates are in the desert? For example, the coordinates 33.9381, -117.3949. Let me think of the Coachella Valley or somewhere in Riverside County. For example, Palm Springs is around 33.82° N, 116.57° W. So that's east of the given longitude. Wait, the given longitude is 117.39° W, which is west of Palm Springs. So maybe somewhere between Palm Springs and San Diego? But that area is mostly desert and the ocean. 

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are in the city of San Clemente? Let me check. San Clemente is at approximately 33.47° N, 117.43° W. Wait, that's close. The given latitude is 33.9381, which is higher (north) than San Clemente. So maybe it's in the area of Dana Point or somewhere north of San Clemente. 

Wait, let me get the exact coordinates. If San Clemente is at 33.47° N, 117.43° W, then the given coordinates are 33.9381° N, which is about 0.468° north, which is roughly 30 miles north. So that would be in Orange County, maybe near Irvine or Costa Mesa. Let me check the longitude. The longitude is 117.39° W, which is slightly east of San Clemente's 117.43° W. So that would be a bit east, maybe inland. 

So, putting it all together, the coordinates are in Orange County, California. Therefore, the state is California. I think that's the answer. Let me just confirm once more. Since the longitude is -117.39, which is within California's longitude range, and the latitude is around 33.9° N, which is in Southern California, the state must be California.
