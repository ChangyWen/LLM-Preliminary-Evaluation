Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 42.6664° N, 73.7987° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which state that is. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. Let me think about the approximate area these coordinates might be in.

Latitude 42.6664 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -73.7987 is in the western hemisphere. The negative longitude means it's west of the Prime Meridian. Now, I need to recall some key cities or states in the United States that are around that latitude and longitude. 

I know that New York City is around 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W, so that's a bit south and west of the given coordinates. Moving north from NYC, maybe Albany? Let me check. Albany, New York is the capital, and I think it's around 42.6526° N, 73.7562° W. Wait, that's very close to the given coordinates. The latitude here is 42.6664, which is almost exactly 42.6526, and the longitude is -73.7987, which is a bit further west than Albany's 73.7562. But maybe that's still within the same city or nearby area. 

So if Albany is at approximately those coordinates, then the state would be New York. Let me confirm. The coordinates given are 42.6664, -73.7987. Let me check an online source or a map. Wait, I can't access the internet, but I can rely on my existing knowledge. Albany's coordinates are indeed close to that. The slight differences might be due to rounding or specific landmarks. For example, the exact coordinates of Albany might vary slightly depending on the specific location within the city. 

Another way to think about it: the longitude -73.7987 is about 73 degrees and 48 minutes west. Since New York State spans from around 40°N to 45°N and 72°W to 79°W, these coordinates are well within New York State. Specifically, the area around Albany is in the eastern part of New York, near the Hudson River. 

Therefore, the place with those coordinates is in the state of New York.
