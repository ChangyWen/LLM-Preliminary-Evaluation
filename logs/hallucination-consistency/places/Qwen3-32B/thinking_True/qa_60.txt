Okay, let's see. The user is asking which state the coordinates 35.1054° N, 106.6465° W are located in. I need to figure out the state in the US that corresponds to these coordinates.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude are given in degrees. The latitude here is 35.1054, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -106.6465, which is in the western hemisphere. Since the US is in both the northern and western hemispheres, that makes sense.

Now, I need to think about the approximate location. Let me recall some key states and their approximate coordinates. For example, New Mexico is in the southwestern part of the US. Its latitude ranges from about 31° N to 37° N, and longitude from around 103° W to 109° W. The given latitude is 35.1° N, which is within New Mexico's range. The longitude is -106.6° W, which is also within New Mexico's longitude range. 

Wait, let me check another state just to be sure. Texas is to the east of New Mexico. Texas's longitude ranges from about 93° W to 107° W. So the longitude here is -106.6, which is just west of Texas's westernmost point. So that would place it in New Mexico. 

Another way to verify is to think of major cities. Albuquerque, New Mexico is around 35.1° N, 106.6° W. Let me confirm that. Yes, Albuquerque's coordinates are approximately 35.1055° N, 106.6465° W. So that's exactly the coordinates given. Therefore, the location is in New Mexico. 

I don't think any other state borders New Mexico in that area. The state to the west of New Mexico is Arizona, but Arizona's longitude is more like 114° W to 109° W. Wait, Arizona's westernmost point is around 114° W, but the eastern part of Arizona would be around 111° W or so. The given longitude is -106.6, which is further east than Arizona's eastern part. So that's definitely in New Mexico. 

So putting it all together, the coordinates point to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Therefore, the state is New Mexico.
