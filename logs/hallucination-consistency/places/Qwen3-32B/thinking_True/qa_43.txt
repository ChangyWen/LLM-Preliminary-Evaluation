Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 30.3322° N, 81.6749° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which state that is. First, I remember that the United States is divided into states, and each has specific latitude and longitude ranges. Let me think about the approximate locations.

Latitude 30° N is pretty far south. The southernmost states like Florida, Texas, and maybe parts of Georgia or South Carolina? But longitude 81.67° W is in the eastern part of the US. Let me break it down. The prime meridian is 0°, so 81.67° W is west of there. The eastern US states like Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, etc., are in that longitude range. 

Wait, Florida's capital is Tallahassee, which I think is around 30.4° N, 84.3° W. But the longitude here is 81.67° W, which is further east. Maybe somewhere in Florida's panhandle? Or perhaps Georgia? Let me check some key cities. Jacksonville, Florida is around 30.33° N, 81.66° W. Oh, that's really close to the given coordinates. So that must be Jacksonville. And Jacksonville is in the state of Florida. 

Let me confirm. If the coordinates are 30.3322, -81.6749, that's very near Jacksonville, FL. So the state would be Florida. I don't think there's another state that's in that exact latitude and longitude. Maybe cross-check with another source. For example, using a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. 

Another way: The 30th parallel north passes through the southern part of the US. In the eastern US, it goes through Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. The longitude 81.67° W is in the eastern part of the US. For example, the 81st meridian west passes through places like North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. So combining both, the intersection of 30° N and 81.67° W would be in Florida, specifically near Jacksonville. 

Therefore, the state is Florida.
