Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 35.3529° N, 119.0359° W are located. First, I need to figure out what place that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be looked up using various tools or maybe even some geographical knowledge.

Starting with the latitude: 35.35 degrees north. That's in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is 119.04 degrees west, so that's in the western hemisphere. Now, thinking about the United States, the western states. Let me recall some major cities and their coordinates. For example, Los Angeles is around 34° N, 118° W. Wait, the given latitude is 35.35, which is a bit north of LA. Maybe somewhere in California? But let me check.

Alternatively, maybe it's in another state. Let me think. The longitude of 119° W is still within California, I believe. California spans from about 32° N to 42° N, and longitudes from around 114° W to 124° W. So 35.35° N, 119.04° W would be in California. But to be sure, maybe I should think of specific locations. 

Wait, there's a place called Bakersfield, California. Let me recall its coordinates. Bakersfield is around 35.35° N, 119.03° W. Oh, that's exactly the coordinates given! So Bakersfield is in California. Therefore, the state is California. 

But just to double-check, maybe I can cross-verify. If I use a coordinate lookup tool or a map. Since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. Another way is to think about nearby cities. For example, Fresno is further east, maybe around 119.7° W. So 119.03 is west of Fresno, which would place it in the Central Valley area. Bakersfield is a major city there. So yes, California. 

I think that's correct. The coordinates correspond to Bakersfield, California. So the state is California.
