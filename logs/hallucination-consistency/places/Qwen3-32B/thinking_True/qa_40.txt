Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 40.8501° N, 73.8662° W are located. Hmm, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. Let me think about the major cities and their coordinates.

First, 40.8501° N is a latitude. New York City is around 40.7128° N, so this is a bit north of NYC. The longitude is -73.8662° W. New York's longitude is about -74.0060° W, so this is east of NYC. Wait, but if it's east of NYC, that would be towards the Atlantic Ocean. But maybe it's in New York State? Or perhaps it's in a neighboring state like New Jersey? Wait, New Jersey is east of New York City, but the coordinates might be in the Hudson River area. Let me check some landmarks. 

I recall that the Tappan Zee Bridge is in that area, connecting Rockland County, New York, to Westchester County. The coordinates might be in the Hudson River. Alternatively, maybe it's in New York City's northern suburbs. Let me think of specific places. The coordinates 40.8501, -73.8662... I think that's in the area of the George Washington Bridge, which connects Manhattan to Fort Lee, New Jersey. Wait, Fort Lee is in New Jersey. So if the coordinates are just across the river from Manhattan, that would be New Jersey. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe it's in New York State. Let me try to recall the exact boundaries. The Hudson River forms part of the boundary between New York and New Jersey. So if the longitude is -73.8662, which is east of NYC's longitude of -74.0060, that would be east of the city. But the exact state boundary... The Hudson River is the boundary, so if the location is on the west side of the river, it's New York, and east would be New Jersey. Wait, but the longitude being -73.8662 is east of NYC's longitude. So if the Hudson River is the boundary, then that point would be in New Jersey. 

Wait, let me check some approximate coordinates. For example, the Empire State Building is at 40.7484° N, 73.9857° W. So that's in Manhattan. The coordinates given are 40.8501° N, which is north of that, and -73.8662° W, which is east. So moving north and east from Manhattan. That would be towards the Tappan Zee area. The Tappan Zee Bridge is around 40.89° N, 73.77° W. So the given coordinates are a bit south of that. 

If the longitude is -73.8662, that's east of the Hudson River. So if the Hudson River is the boundary, then that would be in New Jersey. But I need to be sure. Let me think of a specific location. For example, the town of Tarrytown, New York, is around 40.94° N, 73.73° W. Wait, that's west of the given coordinates. So if the coordinates are -73.8662, that's east of Tarrytown. So maybe that's in New Jersey? 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the Hudson River itself. If the coordinates are in the river, then the state would depend on which side of the river. But the exact location... Let me try to find a specific place. The coordinates 40.8501, -73.8662... I can check using an online map tool, but since I can't do that, I'll have to rely on my knowledge. 

Another approach: The latitude 40.85° N is approximately 40°51' N. The longitude -73.8662° W is approximately 73°52' W. Let me think of places in that area. The George Washington Bridge spans the Hudson River between Manhattan and Fort Lee, New Jersey. The coordinates for Fort Lee are around 40.8447° N, 74.0163° W. Wait, that's a bit west. The given longitude is -73.8662, which is east of Fort Lee. So maybe it's in the river near the George Washington Bridge? 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the area of the Palisades, which are in New Jersey. The coordinates might be in the Hudson River, which is the boundary. If the point is in the river, then it's in New Jersey. But I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, another thought: The coordinates might be in the town of New Rochelle, New York, but that's more west. Alternatively, maybe it's in the area of the Tappan Zee Bridge, but that's further north. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's in the state of New York. Let me think of the longitude. The western part of New York City is around -74.0060° W. The given longitude is -73.8662, which is 0.1398 degrees east. Since each degree of longitude is roughly 69 miles at the equator, but at 40 degrees latitude, it's about 53 miles per degree. So 0.1398 degrees east would be about 7.4 miles east. So that would be about 7 miles east of NYC's longitude. If the Hudson River is the boundary, then that would be in New Jersey. 

Therefore, the coordinates 40.8501, -73.8662 are likely in New Jersey, near the Hudson River, possibly in the area of Fort Lee or across from Manhattan. So the state would be New Jersey.
