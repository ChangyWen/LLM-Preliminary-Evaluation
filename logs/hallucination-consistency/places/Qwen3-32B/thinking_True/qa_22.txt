Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 36.2333° N, 115.2654° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which U.S. state that is. First, I remember that the United States spans a wide range of latitudes and longitudes. Let me start by recalling some key states and their approximate coordinates.

Latitude 36.2333 is a bit north of the 36th parallel. The 36th parallel north runs through several states. For example, it goes through places like Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. But longitude -115.2654 is in the western part of the U.S. because the prime meridian is at 0°, and the western hemisphere goes up to 180° W. So -115.2654° W is in the western part of the country.

Let me think about specific states. Nevada is a state that's quite large and in the western U.S. Its longitude ranges from around 114° W to 120° W, and its latitude from about 35° N to 42° N. The given latitude is 36.2333, which is within Nevada's range. The longitude is -115.2654, which is also within Nevada's range. 

Wait, but I should double-check. Maybe it's in California? California's westernmost point is around 124° W, but its eastern border is with Nevada, so the longitude around -118° W is more central in California. So -115.2654 is further east than California's central longitude. That would place it in Nevada. 

Another way to confirm: I remember that Las Vegas is in Nevada, and its coordinates are approximately 36.1699° N, 115.1398° W. The given coordinates are 36.2333° N, which is a bit north of Las Vegas, and longitude -115.2654, which is slightly west of Las Vegas. So that would still be in Nevada, maybe near the northern part of the state or somewhere in the central area. 

I don't think it's in Utah because Utah's longitude is more around 111° W to 114° W. Arizona's longitude is around 111° W to 114° W as well. So that's east of -115.2654. So Nevada is the most likely candidate here. 

To be thorough, maybe I can check if there's any other state that fits. New Mexico's longitude is around 103° W to 109° W, so that's too far east. Texas is even further east. So yes, Nevada is the correct state. Therefore, the coordinates 36.2333° N, 115.2654° W are located in Nevada.
