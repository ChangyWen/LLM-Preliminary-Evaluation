Okay, let's see. The user is asking which state the coordinates 36.783° N, 119.7939° W are located in. First, I need to figure out where those coordinates point to.

I remember that latitude and longitude are used to specify locations on Earth. The latitude here is 36.783 degrees north, and the longitude is 119.7939 degrees west. So, I need to determine which U.S. state this is in. 

Starting with the latitude: 36.783° N. The United States has several states in the 36°N range. For example, parts of California, Nevada, Arizona, and maybe even Texas or New Mexico. But longitude is 119.79° W, which is quite far west. Let me think about the longitudinal ranges of the states. 

California's longitude ranges from about 114°W to 124°W, so 119.79°W is within that range. Nevada is east of California, so its longitude is more like 114°W to 120°W, but the western part of Nevada would be around 119°W. However, the latitude 36.783°N is a bit tricky. Let me check some major cities. 

Los Angeles is around 34°N, so 36.783°N is north of LA. Maybe somewhere in the Central Valley of California? Or perhaps in the Sierra Nevada region. Alternatively, could it be in Nevada? Let me think about Reno, Nevada. Reno is around 39.5°N, which is north of 36.783, so maybe not. 

Wait, maybe I should use a more precise method. Let me recall that 36°N is a line that runs through the southern part of California, like near Bakersfield or maybe even the Salton Sea. The longitude 119.79°W is pretty far west. Let me check some coordinates. For example, the city of Bakersfield is approximately 35.367°N, 119.016°W. So that's a bit south and east of the given coordinates. 

What about the area around the Tehachapi Mountains? Or maybe the area near the California-Nevada border? Wait, the longitude 119.79°W is still within California's western boundary. Let me check the coordinates for Barstow, California. Barstow is around 34.94°N, 117.19°W, which is east and south. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the Mojave Desert. Let me think of coordinates for Death Valley. Death Valley is around 36.5°N, 116.9°W. So that's east of the given longitude. The given longitude is 119.79°W, which is further west. 

Wait, perhaps it's in the Central Valley. Let me check coordinates for Fresno. Fresno is approximately 36.75°N, 119.79°W. Oh! That's very close to the given coordinates. So 36.783°N, 119.7939°W is almost exactly the coordinates for Fresno, California. Therefore, the state would be California. 

But wait, I should double-check. Let me confirm the exact coordinates for Fresno. A quick search in my mind: yes, Fresno's coordinates are roughly 36.75°N, 119.82°W. The given coordinates are 36.783 and 119.7939, which are very close. So that's in California. 

Therefore, the answer should be California.
