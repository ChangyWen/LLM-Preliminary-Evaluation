Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 40.2752° N, 76.8843° W are located. I need to figure out which state that is.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude coordinates can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 40.2752, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -76.8843, which is in the western hemisphere. So that places it in the United States, probably in the eastern part since the longitude is around 76-77 degrees west.

Now, thinking about U.S. states. Let me recall some key coordinates. For example, Philadelphia is around 39.9526° N, 75.1652° W. So that's a bit south and east. Pittsburgh is approximately 40.4406° N, 79.9960° W. That's a bit north and west. The given latitude is 40.2752, which is between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh's latitudes. The longitude is -76.8843, which is west of Philadelphia's longitude but east of Pittsburgh's. So maybe somewhere in Pennsylvania? Let me check.

Another way is to think about the approximate location. 40 degrees north is a line that goes through places like Columbus, Ohio, and parts of Pennsylvania. The longitude of 76-77 degrees west would be in Pennsylvania, maybe near Harrisburg? Harrisburg's coordinates are around 40.2744° N, 76.8844° W. Wait, that's almost exactly the coordinates given! So the place is Harrisburg, which is the capital of Pennsylvania. Therefore, the state is Pennsylvania.

I should verify this. Let me cross-check with another source. If I recall correctly, Harrisburg is indeed at approximately 40.2744° N, 76.8844° W. The user's coordinates are 40.2752 and -76.8843, which are very close to Harrisburg's exact coordinates. The slight differences could be due to rounding or different sources, but the location is definitely Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. So the state is Pennsylvania.
