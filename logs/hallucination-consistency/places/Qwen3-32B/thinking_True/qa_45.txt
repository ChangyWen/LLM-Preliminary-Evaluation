Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 36.1715° N, 86.7842° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which state that is. I remember that the United States is divided into states, and each has specific coordinates. Let me think about the approximate locations.

First, latitude 36 degrees north. That's somewhere in the southern part of the U.S. Maybe Tennessee, Alabama, or Georgia? Then longitude 86.7842 west. Let me recall. The longitude 86 degrees west... I think that's in the eastern part of the U.S. Maybe the southeastern states. 

Wait, Nashville, Tennessee is around 36.1627° N, 86.7816° W. Oh, that's really close to the given coordinates. So the coordinates provided are almost exactly at Nashville. Therefore, the state would be Tennessee. Let me double-check. If I look up the coordinates for Nashville, they match almost exactly. So the place is in Tennessee. I think that's correct. I don't think there's another major city with those coordinates. Let me confirm with another source. Maybe using a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I'll rely on my existing knowledge. Yes, Nashville is in Tennessee, so the answer should be Tennessee.
