Okay, let's see. The user is asking which state the coordinates 35.1087° N, 89.9663° W are located in. I need to figure that out.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 35.1087 degrees north, and the longitude is 89.9663 degrees west. I should probably convert these coordinates into a more readable format or use a method to determine the state.

I know that the United States is divided into states, and each state has specific geographic boundaries. Let me think about the approximate regions. The latitude 35 degrees north is somewhere in the southern part of the U.S. For example, states like Tennessee, Georgia, or maybe even parts of Alabama. The longitude 90 degrees west is a bit more westward. The Mississippi River runs roughly along 90 degrees west, so maybe around the area of Memphis, Tennessee? Because Memphis is near the Mississippi River and is in Tennessee.

Wait, let me check. Memphis is at approximately 35.1495° N, 90.0490° W. The given coordinates are 35.1087° N, 89.9663° W. That's pretty close to Memphis. So if Memphis is in Tennessee, then this location is likely in Tennessee. But I should confirm if there's any other state nearby. The coordinates are just a bit south and east of Memphis. Maybe Shelby County, Tennessee? Shelby County is the largest county in Tennessee and includes Memphis. 

Alternatively, could it be in Mississippi? The Mississippi River forms part of the boundary between Tennessee and Mississippi. If the coordinates are on the west side of the river, that would be Mississippi. But Memphis is on the west bank of the Mississippi River, so Shelby County, Tennessee, is on the east side. Wait, no, Memphis is actually on the west bank of the Mississippi River, which would be in Tennessee. Wait, no, Memphis is in Tennessee, and the Mississippi River is to the west of it. So the coordinates given are slightly east of Memphis, maybe still in Tennessee. 

Alternatively, maybe using an online tool or a map would help. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. Let me think of other cities. The coordinates 35.1087, -89.9663 are very close to the coordinates of the Memphis International Airport, which is at 35.1087° N, 89.9663° W. So that's a key point. The airport is in Shelby County, Tennessee. Therefore, the state is Tennessee.

I should also consider if there's any possibility of it being in another state. For example, just across the river in Arkansas? But the longitude is 89.9663, which is about 90 degrees west. The Mississippi River's exact path might vary, but Memphis is a major city in Tennessee, and the coordinates are in Shelby County. So I'm pretty confident the answer is Tennessee.
