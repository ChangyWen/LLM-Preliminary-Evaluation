Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 32.8313° N, 117.1222° W are located. First, I need to figure out what place that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. Let me start by recalling some major cities and their coordinates.

San Diego comes to mind because I know it's in California, and I think it's around that latitude. Let me check. San Diego's coordinates are approximately 32.7157° N, 117.1611° W. The given latitude here is 32.8313, which is a bit north of San Diego's actual latitude. The longitude is -117.1222, which is slightly east (since longitude decreases as you go east) compared to San Diego's -117.1611. So maybe it's a bit north and east of San Diego?

Wait, maybe it's in California still. Let me think of other cities. Coronado is a city near San Diego, across the bay. Its coordinates are around 32.8313° N, 117.1222° W. Oh, that matches exactly! So the coordinates given are for Coronado, California. Therefore, the state is California. But I should confirm to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me double-check with a map or a geographical database. If I look up 32.8313, -117.1222, it should show Coronado. Yes, that's correct. Coronado is a city in San Diego County, California. So the answer is California.
