Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 28.4773° N, 81.337° W are located. First, I need to figure out what place that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be looked up using various tools or maybe even some geographical knowledge.

Starting with the latitude, 28.4773° N. That's in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is -81.337°, which is 81.337° west of the Prime Meridian. So that's in the western hemisphere. Now, thinking about the United States, the states in the southeastern part are around that latitude and longitude. Let me think. Florida is a state that's along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic. The coordinates given are in the northern part of Florida, maybe near Tampa or somewhere in the central part. Wait, I think I've heard that the coordinates for Tampa are around 27.9944° N, 82.4589° W. Hmm, so maybe this is a bit north of Tampa. Alternatively, maybe it's in the Orlando area? Orlando is around 28.5° N, 81.4° W. Wait, the given latitude is 28.4773, which is approximately 28.48° N, and longitude -81.337°, which is 81.34° W. Comparing that to Orlando's coordinates, which are roughly 28.5° N, 81.4° W. So that's pretty close. So maybe the coordinates are in Orlando, Florida. Therefore, the state would be Florida. Let me double-check. If I recall correctly, Florida's latitude ranges from about 24° N to 31° N, and longitude from around 80° W to 85° W. So 28.4773° N is within that range, and -81.337° W is also within the longitude range. So yes, it's in Florida. I think that's the answer.
