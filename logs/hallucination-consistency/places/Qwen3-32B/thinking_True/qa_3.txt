Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 41.8375° N, 87.6866° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which state that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. Let me think about the major cities and their coordinates.

First, the latitude is 41.8375. That's in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is -87.6866, which is in the western hemisphere. I think the United States is in the western hemisphere. Now, I need to recall which states are around that latitude and longitude. 

Chicago comes to mind. I think Chicago's coordinates are around 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W. Wait, the given longitude here is -87.6866, which is a bit further west than Chicago's longitude. But maybe it's still in Illinois? Because Chicago is in Illinois. Let me check the exact coordinates. 

Alternatively, maybe it's another city. Let me think. If the latitude is approximately 41.8 degrees, that's close to Chicago's latitude. The longitude is -87.68, which is a bit west of Chicago's longitude. But how much difference does that make? Maybe it's still within Illinois. 

Another approach: I can use the fact that the prime meridian is at 0°, and the longitude here is 87.68 degrees west. The United States spans from about 66°W to 124°W. So 87.68 is in the eastern part of the US. States like Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, etc., are in that range. 

Since the latitude is around 41.8, which is roughly the same as Chicago, which is in Illinois. Let me confirm. If I look up the coordinates for Chicago, it's approximately 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W. The given coordinates are 41.8375° N, 87.6866° W. So the latitude is slightly south of Chicago, and the longitude is slightly west. But that's still within Illinois, right? Because the longitude difference is about 0.0568 degrees, which is roughly 6 miles west. So the location is a few miles west and south of Chicago. 

Therefore, the state should be Illinois. I don't think that point is in Indiana because Indiana is to the east of Illinois, but the longitude here is west of Chicago, so still Illinois. Let me think if there's any other state nearby. Maybe Wisconsin? No, Wisconsin is north of Illinois, but the latitude here is similar to Chicago, so probably not. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Lake Michigan? Wait, Lake Michigan is to the east of Chicago. The coordinates given are west of Chicago, so that would be in the lake? Wait, no. Chicago is on the shore of Lake Michigan. If the longitude is more west, that would be into the lake. But the coordinates given are 41.8375, -87.6866. Let me check if that's in the lake. 

Wait, Chicago's longitude is about -87.63, so moving west to -87.68 would be about 0.05 degrees west, which is about 3-4 miles. Since Chicago is on the lake, moving west from there would be into Lake Michigan. But the question is about a place, so if it's in the lake, maybe it's not a state. But the user is asking for the state. So perhaps the coordinates are actually on land. Maybe I made a mistake here. 

Wait, maybe I should check the exact coordinates. Let me think. If I use a coordinate lookup tool, but since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my knowledge. Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are for a specific landmark. For example, O'Hare International Airport is in Chicago. Let me recall its coordinates. O'Hare's coordinates are approximately 41.9950° N, 87.9336° W. That's more north and west. The given coordinates are south and slightly west of Chicago. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the city of Chicago. Let me think. The coordinates 41.8375, -87.6866. Let me compare with the city's coordinates. Chicago's coordinates are usually given as 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W. So the given latitude is 41.8375, which is about 0.04 degrees south, which is roughly 4.5 miles south. The longitude is -87.6866, which is 0.0568 degrees west of Chicago's longitude. That's about 6.3 miles west. So the location is about 4.5 miles south and 6.3 miles west of Chicago's central coordinates. 

So that would place it in the southern part of Chicago or maybe in the surrounding suburbs. But regardless, the state is still Illinois. Unless it's in the lake, but if it's 6 miles west of Chicago, that's in Lake Michigan. Wait, but maybe the coordinates are for a specific point on land. Maybe I'm miscalculating. 

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are for a different city. Let me think of other cities in Illinois. For example, Joliet is south of Chicago. Let me check approximate coordinates for Joliet. Joliet is around 41.5909° N, 87.9988° W. Wait, that's more west and south. The given coordinates are 41.8375° N, which is north of Joliet's latitude. So maybe it's in the southern suburbs of Chicago. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in Indiana? But Indiana is east of Illinois. The longitude here is west of Chicago, so that's still Illinois. Unless the coordinates are in the lake, but then the state would be... Well, Lake Michigan is between Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. But the coordinates are in the US. If it's in the lake, the state would still be Illinois because the western shore is Illinois. 

Wait, but if the coordinates are in the lake, then technically it's in Lake Michigan, but the question is about the state. So if it's in the lake, the state would be Illinois. So regardless, the answer is Illinois. 

Therefore, I think the state is Illinois.
