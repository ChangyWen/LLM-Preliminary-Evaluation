Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 39.5497° N, 119.8483° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that the United States is divided into states, and each state has specific geographic boundaries. The latitude given is 39.5497, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -119.8483, which is in the western hemisphere. 

Let me think about the approximate location. The longitude of -119.8483 is close to 120° W, which is a line that runs through California and Nevada. The latitude 39.5° N is roughly around the area of the central United States. For example, places like Denver, Colorado are around 40° N, so 39.5° would be a bit south of that. 

Now, considering the longitude, 120° W is west of the Mississippi River. States like California, Nevada, and maybe Oregon come to mind. Let me break it down. California's longitude ranges from about 114° W to 124° W, so -119.8483 is within that range. The latitude 39.5° N in California would be in the northern part of the state, maybe around the Sacramento area? Wait, Sacramento is around 38.5° N, so 39.5° would be a bit further north. But California's northern border is with Oregon, which is around 42° N. So 39.5° N is still within California.

Alternatively, Nevada's longitude is from about 114° W to 120° W, so the longitude here is right on the edge. The latitude for Nevada ranges from 35° N to 42° N, so 39.5° N is within Nevada's range as well. But where exactly is this point? Let me check the exact coordinates. The longitude is -119.8483, which is just west of 120° W. Nevada's western border is the Sierra Nevada mountain range, and the eastern part of California is near the Sierra Nevada. So maybe this point is in the eastern part of California, near the Nevada border. 

Wait, the longitude is -119.8483, which is approximately 119.85° W. The California-Nevada border is at 120° W, so this point is just east of that line. Wait, no, longitude decreases as you go east. So 119.8483° W is east of 120° W. Therefore, if the border is at 120° W, then this point is east of the border, which would be in Nevada. Wait, that can't be right. Let me clarify. If the longitude is -119.8483, that's 119.8483 degrees west. The California-Nevada border is at 120° W. So 119.8483 is east of 120° W, meaning it's in California. Because east of 120° W would be towards the east, so California is east of Nevada in this region. Wait, no, Nevada is to the east of California? No, actually, California is west of Nevada. The Sierra Nevada mountains are in California, and Nevada is to the east of those mountains. So the California-Nevada border is along the Sierra Nevada. The longitude line of 120° W runs through California, but the exact border between California and Nevada isn't exactly at 120° W. Let me check. The California-Nevada border is defined by the 39° N latitude line from the Sierra Nevada to the 120° W longitude, and then follows the 120° W longitude north to 42° N. Wait, that might be the case. So the border between California and Nevada is along 39° N to 42° N along 120° W. So if the latitude here is 39.5497° N, which is north of 39° N, then the border at that latitude would be along 120° W. Therefore, the longitude of -119.8483 is east of 120° W, so that would be in Nevada. Wait, but that would mean the point is in Nevada. But I need to confirm. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the directions. Let me think again. If the longitude is -119.8483, that's 119.8483 degrees west. The California-Nevada border at this latitude (north of 39° N) is at 120° W. So if the longitude is less than 120° W (i.e., more negative), it's further west. Wait, no. Wait, longitude values west of the prime meridian are negative. So a longitude of -120° is further west than -119°. So -119.8483 is actually east of -120°, because it's a smaller number. So if the border is at -120°, then anything east of that (i.e., with a longitude greater than -120°) would be in California, and west of that (i.e., more negative) would be in Nevada. Wait, no, that's not right. If the border is at 120° W (longitude -120), then east of that line would be towards the east, which would be in California, and west of that line would be in Nevada. Wait, but Nevada is east of the Sierra Nevada, which is in California. So the border is at 120° W. So if the longitude is -119.8483, which is east of -120, that would be in California. Therefore, the point is in California. 

But I'm getting confused here. Let me try to visualize. Imagine a map where the California-Nevada border is at 120° W. If you're at 120° W, that's the border. If you move east (towards lower longitude values, like -119°), you're moving into California. If you move west (towards more negative longitudes, like -121°), you're moving into Nevada. Wait, no, longitude decreases as you go west. So moving west from 120° W would be more negative, like -121°, but that's actually further west. So if the border is at 120° W, then east of that (towards lower negative numbers) is California, and west of that (more negative) is Nevada. Therefore, a longitude of -119.8483 is east of 120° W (since -119.8483 is greater than -120), so that would be in California. Therefore, the coordinates 39.5497° N, 119.8483° W are in California. 

But wait, I should check if there's any other factors. For example, maybe the border isn't exactly at 120° W. Let me recall. The California-Nevada border is indeed defined by the 120° W longitude line from 39° N to 42° N. So at latitudes above 39° N, the border is along 120° W. The given latitude is 39.5497° N, which is above 39° N, so the border is at 120° W. Therefore, the longitude of -119.8483 is east of the border, so in California. 

Therefore, the state is California. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes there are exceptions. Let me think of a specific location. For example, the city of Bakersfield, California is around 35.3677° N, 119.0167° W. That's further south and east. The coordinates given are 39.5497° N, which is much further north. So that would be in the northern part of California, near the Oregon border. Wait, but the longitude is -119.8483, which is still in the central valley area? Or maybe near the Sierra Nevada. 

Alternatively, maybe this is in the Modoc National Forest or somewhere in the northeastern part of California. But regardless, according to the border definition, it's in California. 

Another way to check is to use an online map or a geolocation tool. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my knowledge. I think the key here is the longitude being east of 120° W, which places it in California. Therefore, the answer should be California.
