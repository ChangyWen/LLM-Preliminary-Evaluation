Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 40.7498° N, 73.7976° W are located. First, I need to figure out what place these coordinates correspond to.

I remember that latitude and longitude are used to pinpoint locations on Earth. The latitude here is 40.7498, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -73.7976, which is in the western hemisphere. The negative longitude suggests it's west of the Prime Meridian, so that's the Americas.

Now, thinking about major cities in the United States. New York City is a big one. The coordinates for New York City are roughly around 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W. Wait, the given latitude here is 40.7498, which is a bit higher (north) than NYC's usual coordinates. The longitude is -73.7976, which is east of -74.0060. So maybe this is a specific location within New York City?

Let me check. If the latitude is 40.7498, that's about 40.75° N. The longitude -73.7976 is approximately -73.8° W. Comparing to NYC's coordinates, this might be in the northern part of Manhattan. For example, Central Park is around 40.78° N, 73.96° W. Wait, but this longitude is -73.7976, which is further east than Central Park. Maybe it's in Queens or Brooklyn? Or perhaps it's a specific landmark.

Alternatively, maybe it's not in New York City. Let me think. The state of New York includes New York City, so if it's in NYC, the state is New York. But I should confirm the exact location. Maybe using a map or a geolocation tool. Since I can't access external resources, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge.

Another approach: the latitude 40.75° N is approximately 40 degrees and 45 minutes north. The longitude -73.8° W is 73 degrees and 48 minutes west. If I recall, the Empire State Building is at around 40.7484° N, 73.9856° W. Wait, that's a longitude of -73.9856, which is west of the given -73.7976. So the given longitude is further east. That would place it east of the Empire State Building. Maybe in Midtown or Downtown Manhattan?

Alternatively, maybe it's in New Jersey? But New Jersey is across the Hudson River from Manhattan. However, the coordinates given are still within New York City's latitude range. For example, the southern tip of Manhattan is around 40.69° N, and the northern part is around 40.91° N. So 40.75° N is within Manhattan. The longitude -73.7976 is east of the typical NYC coordinates. Let me think of specific places. The United Nations headquarters is at around 40.7489° N, 73.9672° W. Still west of the given longitude. Wait, the given longitude is -73.7976, which is 73.7976 degrees west. So that's 73 degrees and about 47.8 minutes west. Comparing to NYC's longitude of around 74 degrees west, this is actually east of NYC's usual longitude. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, longitude values west of the Prime Meridian increase as you go west. So a longitude of -73.7976 is actually east of -74.0060. So if NYC is around -74.0060, then this location is east of that, meaning closer to the Atlantic Ocean. But NYC is on the coast, so maybe this is in Brooklyn or Queens? Or perhaps it's a typo? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers. Let me double-check.

Wait, the longitude is -73.7976. Let me convert that to degrees and minutes. 0.7976 degrees is 0.7976 * 60 = 47.856 minutes. So that's 73 degrees 47.856 minutes west. The longitude of NYC is around 74 degrees west, which is 74 degrees. So 73 degrees 47 minutes is actually east of 74 degrees. So this location is east of NYC's typical longitude. But NYC is on the coast, so east of NYC would be over the ocean. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Unless it's a specific point in NYC that's further east. Wait, maybe the coordinates are in New York City, but in a part that's further east. For example, the easternmost point of NYC is in Queens, near the Long Island Sound. Let me think. The coordinates for the eastern tip of Long Island are around 40.7° N, 72.7° W, but that's way east. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the longitude -73.7976 is 73.7976 degrees west. So compared to the typical NYC longitude of 74 degrees west, this is 0.2024 degrees east. Since 1 degree of longitude is roughly 111 km, 0.2 degrees is about 22 km east. So if NYC is around 74°W, then 73.7976°W is about 22 km east of NYC. But NYC is on the coast, so 22 km east would be in the Atlantic Ocean. That can't be right. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the coordinates, or maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I got the longitude direction wrong. Wait, longitude values west of the Prime Meridian are negative. So a lower absolute value (closer to zero) means further east. So -73.7976 is further east than -74.0060. So if NYC is at -74.0060, then -73.7976 is east of that. But NYC is on the coast, so east of NYC would be the ocean. Therefore, unless the coordinates are in a different location. Wait, maybe it's in New York State but not in NYC? For example, Long Island is east of NYC. Wait, Long Island is to the east of NYC? No, Long Island is to the east of NYC in terms of the island's orientation. Wait, NYC is on the western end of Long Island. Wait, Long Island is a large island that includes Nassau and Suffolk counties, with NYC (Brooklyn and Queens) on the western part. So the eastern part of Long Island would be further east, like in Suffolk County. So if the coordinates are in Suffolk County, that's still part of New York State. But the latitude 40.75° N is in the area of NYC. Wait, the latitude 40.75° N is around the same as NYC. So if the longitude is -73.7976, which is east of NYC, but still within New York State, perhaps in Nassau County? Let me check approximate coordinates for Nassau County. Nassau County is east of NYC, so maybe around 40.7° N, 73.7° W? That would make sense. So if the coordinates are 40.7498, -73.7976, that would be in Nassau County, New York. Therefore, the state is New York.

Alternatively, maybe it's a specific location in NYC, like in Queens or Brooklyn. For example, the coordinates for Brooklyn are around 40.65° N, 73.95° W. Wait, but the given latitude is 40.75° N, which is north of that. So maybe in Queens? Queens is the largest borough and extends north and east. Let me think of specific landmarks. The coordinates for LaGuardia Airport are around 40.775° N, 73.871° W. That's a bit north and west of the given coordinates. The given longitude is -73.7976, which is east of LaGuardia's longitude. So maybe in the eastern part of Queens? Or perhaps in Nassau County. Either way, the state would still be New York.

Therefore, regardless of the exact city or county, the state is New York.
