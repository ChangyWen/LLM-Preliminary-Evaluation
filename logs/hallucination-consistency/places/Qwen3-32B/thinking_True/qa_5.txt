Okay, let's see. The user is asking which state the coordinates 32.7935° N, 96.7667° W are located in. I need to figure that out.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 32.7935, which is in the northern hemisphere since it's positive. The longitude is -96.7667, which is in the western hemisphere. So that places it somewhere in the southern United States, maybe Texas? Because Texas is a large state and covers a range of latitudes and longitudes.

Let me check some key points. The approximate latitude for Dallas, Texas is around 32.7767° N, and the longitude is about 96.7931° W. The given coordinates are 32.7935 and -96.7667. Comparing these, they're very close to Dallas. The slight differences might be due to rounding or specific locations within the city. Dallas is in Texas, so that would make the state Texas. 

But wait, I should confirm if there are any other states nearby that could have similar coordinates. For example, Oklahoma is to the north of Texas, but the latitude 32.79 is more southern. Let me think about Oklahoma's approximate latitude range. Oklahoma's northernmost point is around 37° N, and southernmost is about 33.5° N. Wait, 32.79 is actually south of Oklahoma's southernmost point, so that would be in Texas. 

Another way to verify is to use an online converter or a map. But since I can't access external resources, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge. The coordinates given are very close to the Dallas area, which is in Texas. Therefore, the state should be Texas.
