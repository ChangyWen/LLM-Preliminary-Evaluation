Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 36.1283° N, 95.9042° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that the United States is divided into states, and each state has specific latitude and longitude ranges. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact coordinates, so I need to think.

Latitude 36.1283 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -95.9042 is in the western hemisphere. Let me recall the approximate locations. The central part of the US is around the 95° W longitude. For example, Oklahoma City is around 35.48° N, 97.51° W. Wait, that's a bit west. Maybe the coordinates given are in Oklahoma? But the latitude here is 36.12, which is a bit north of Oklahoma City. Alternatively, maybe it's in Kansas? Kansas is to the north of Oklahoma. The latitude for Kansas City is around 39.09° N, so that's too far north. Hmm.

Wait, let me think of other states. Arkansas is to the east of Oklahoma. The coordinates for Little Rock, Arkansas are approximately 34.74° N, 92.29° W. So that's east and a bit south. The longitude here is -95.90, which is west of Little Rock. So maybe it's in Oklahoma? Let me check. The longitude for Oklahoma City is around 97.5° W, which is further west than -95.90. So -95.90 is east of Oklahoma City. So maybe somewhere in central Oklahoma? Or perhaps in Texas? Wait, Texas is to the south. The longitude for Dallas is around 96.8° W, which is close. Dallas is at about 32.78° N, 96.8° W. The given latitude is 36.12, which is north of Dallas. So maybe somewhere in northern Texas? But Texas's northern border is with Oklahoma. Wait, but the longitude -95.90 is between Oklahoma and Texas. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe it's in Kansas. Let me check the approximate coordinates for Topeka, Kansas. Topeka is around 39.04° N, 95.66° W. That's a bit north and east of the given coordinates. The given latitude is 36.12, which is south of Topeka. So maybe somewhere in southern Kansas? But I'm not sure. Let me try to recall the approximate boundaries. The 36th parallel north passes through several states. For example, in the central US, it goes through places like Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The longitude -95.90 is in the central part of the US. Let me think of a city near those coordinates. Maybe Tulsa, Oklahoma? Tulsa's coordinates are approximately 36.16° N, 95.96° W. Oh, that's very close! The given coordinates are 36.1283° N, 95.9042° W. So that's almost exactly Tulsa, Oklahoma. Therefore, the state would be Oklahoma. Let me confirm. Tulsa is in Oklahoma, so the answer should be Oklahoma.
