Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 33.5722째 N, 112.0892째 W are located. First, I need to figure out where that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be looked up using various tools or maybe even some geographical knowledge.

Starting with the latitude: 33.57 degrees north. That's in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is 112.09 degrees west, so that's in the western hemisphere. Now, thinking about the United States, the western states. Arizona comes to mind because it's in the southwestern part. The coordinates might be in Arizona. But wait, let me think more carefully.

Phoenix, Arizona's capital, is around 33.45 degrees north and 112.07 degrees west. Wait, the given longitude is -112.0892, which is very close to Phoenix's longitude. The latitude here is 33.57, which is a bit north of Phoenix. Maybe it's a different city or area in Arizona. Let me check if there's another major city nearby. Scottsdale is north of Phoenix, but I'm not sure about the exact coordinates. Alternatively, maybe it's in a different state. Let me consider other possibilities.

New Mexico is to the east of Arizona, but the longitude would be more east (less negative). Nevada is to the north, but longitude would be more west (more negative). Wait, 112 degrees west is actually east of Nevada, which is more around 115-117 degrees west. So Arizona is more likely. Let me confirm. The coordinates 33.57, -112.09... If Phoenix is at 33.45, then this is about 0.12 degrees north, which is roughly 13 miles north. So maybe it's near Phoenix, Arizona. Therefore, the state would be Arizona. But to be sure, maybe I should cross-check with another method. For example, using a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. Another thought: the area around those coordinates might be part of the Sonoran Desert, which spans Arizona and parts of California and Mexico. But since the longitude is -112, which is in the US, not Mexico. So it's in Arizona. Therefore, the answer is Arizona.
