Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 38.1663° N, 85.6485° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure out which state that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint locations. Let me think about the approximate regions.

First, the latitude is 38.1663° N. That's in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is -85.6485° W, which is in the western hemisphere. Now, I need to recall the states in the United States that are around that area. Let me break it down.

The latitude 38 degrees north... I know that Kentucky is around that latitude. For example, the capital of Kentucky, Frankfort, is around 38.1663° N. Wait, that's exactly the latitude given here. And the longitude is -85.6485° W. Let me check Frankfort's coordinates. I think Frankfort's coordinates are approximately 38.1663° N, 85.6485° W. So that would place it in Kentucky. 

But wait, maybe I should verify. Let me think of other states. Ohio is a bit north, maybe around 40 degrees. Indiana is east of Kentucky. Tennessee is south of Kentucky. So if the longitude is -85.6485° W, that's in the central part of the US. Kentucky's longitude ranges from about 81° W to 85° W. So -85.6485° W is towards the western part of Kentucky. That makes sense because Frankfort is in central Kentucky, but maybe a bit more west? Or maybe it's another city. 

Alternatively, maybe it's Louisville? Let me recall. Louisville is around 38.2527° N, 85.7585° W. The given longitude is -85.6485, which is a bit east of Louisville. So maybe it's somewhere between Frankfort and Louisville. Either way, both cities are in Kentucky. 

Another way to check is to use a map or a geographical database. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. I'm pretty confident that those coordinates are in Kentucky. Let me think if there's any other state that could be in that area. Maybe Indiana? But Indiana is more east, with longitudes around 84° W to 88° W? Wait, no, Indiana is east of Kentucky, so longitudes would be more east (less negative). For example, Indianapolis is around 39.7684° N, 86.1581° W. So -86.1581 is more west than -85.6485. So -85.6485 is east of Indianapolis, which would be in Kentucky. 

Therefore, the coordinates 38.1663° N, 85.6485° W are in the state of Kentucky. I think that's correct. Let me just confirm once more. If the latitude is 38.1663, which is very close to Frankfort's latitude, and the longitude is -85.6485, which is close to Frankfort's longitude as well. So yes, Frankfort, Kentucky is at those coordinates. Therefore, the state is Kentucky.
