Okay, let's see. The user is asking which state the coordinates 30.442° N, 91.1311° W are located in. I need to figure out the state in the US that corresponds to these coordinates.

First, I remember that latitude and longitude are given in degrees. The latitude here is 30.442, which is in the northern hemisphere since it's positive. The longitude is -91.1311, which is in the western hemisphere. So, we're looking at a location in the southern United States, probably in the Gulf Coast region.

Let me think about the approximate locations. Latitude 30° N is roughly around the southern part of the US, like New Orleans, Louisiana, which is near 30° N. The longitude 90° W is a common reference line that runs through the central US. For example, the 90th meridian west passes through places like St. Louis, Missouri, but further south, it would be in Louisiana or Mississippi.

The given longitude is -91.1311, which is a bit west of 90° W. So, moving west from the 90th meridian, that would place it more into Louisiana. Let me check some key cities. New Orleans is around 30.0° N, 90.0° W. If the latitude is 30.442, that's a bit north of New Orleans. Maybe near Baton Rouge? Baton Rouge is the capital of Louisiana, and its coordinates are approximately 30.4581° N, 91.1875° W. Comparing that to the given coordinates (30.442, -91.1311), they are very close. The latitude is almost the same, and the longitude is slightly east of Baton Rouge's longitude. So this location is probably in the Baton Rouge area, which is in Louisiana.

Wait, let me confirm. If the longitude is -91.1311, and Baton Rouge is at -91.1875, then the given longitude is east of Baton Rouge. That would place it a bit to the east, maybe still within Louisiana. Let me think of other cities. Maybe somewhere near the Mississippi River? The Mississippi River flows through Louisiana, and the coordinates given are in the southern part of the US. 

Alternatively, maybe using a map or a geographical tool would help, but since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. Another way is to recall that the 30th parallel north passes through the southern US, cutting through Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The longitude of 91° W is in the central part of Louisiana. So combining 30.44° N and 91.13° W, that's in the central or southern part of Louisiana. 

I think the answer is Louisiana. Let me double-check. If I consider that the coordinates are for Baton Rouge, which is in Louisiana, and the given coordinates are very close to that, then yes, the state is Louisiana. I don't think there's another state that fits those coordinates. So the final answer should be Louisiana.
