Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 41.3113° N, 72.9246° W are located. First, I need to figure out what place that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be looked up using various tools or maybe even some geographical knowledge.

Starting with the coordinates: 41.3113° N is the latitude, which is in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is 72.9246° W, which is in the western hemisphere. Now, I need to think about the regions where these coordinates fall. The latitude 41 degrees north is a bit north of the 40th parallel, which runs through places like New York City, Rome, and Beijing. But since the longitude is 72.92 west, that's in the eastern United States.

Let me think about the states in the eastern US. Connecticut, New York, New Jersey... Connecticut's longitude ranges from about 71° W to 73.5° W. The latitude for Connecticut is roughly between 41° N and 42° N. So 41.31° N is within that range. The longitude 72.92° W is also within Connecticut's range. 

Wait, maybe I should check if there's a specific city there. I recall that New Haven, Connecticut is around 41.31° N, 72.92° W. Yes, that's right. New Haven is a city in Connecticut. So the coordinates given are for New Haven, which is in the state of Connecticut. 

I can also cross-verify this. If I think of other states, like New York, their western longitude is around 74° W to 79° W, but New York City is around 74° W. So 72.92° W is further east, which would be more towards Connecticut or maybe even Rhode Island. But Rhode Island's longitude is more like 71.5° W to 71.8° W. So Connecticut fits better here. 

Another way to confirm is to remember that the coordinates for New Haven are approximately 41.31° N, 72.92° W. Therefore, the state is Connecticut. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure there's no other place with similar coordinates. Maybe using a mental map or recalling that the Connecticut River is in that area, but the coordinates are more specific to New Haven. 

Yes, I'm pretty confident the answer is Connecticut.
