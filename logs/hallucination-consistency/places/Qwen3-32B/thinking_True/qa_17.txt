Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 40.6501° N, 73.9496° W are located. Hmm, I remember that latitude and longitude can pinpoint a specific location. Let me think about these numbers.

First, latitude 40.65 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -73.95 is in the western hemisphere. I know that New York City is around 40.7° N and 73.9° W. Let me check that. The coordinates given are 40.65 and -73.9496. That's very close to New York City. Specifically, those coordinates might be in Manhattan. 

Wait, what's the exact location? Maybe the Empire State Building? I think the Empire State Building is around 40.7484° N, 73.9857° W, which is a bit north and west. But the coordinates here are 40.65, which is a bit south. Maybe it's in Brooklyn? Or maybe it's the Statue of Liberty? The Statue of Liberty is at approximately 40.6892° N, 74.0445° W. Hmm, that's a bit east. 

Alternatively, maybe it's JFK Airport? Let me recall. JFK's coordinates are around 40.6413° N, 73.7922° W. That's a bit east longitude-wise. The given longitude is -73.9496, which is west of JFK. Wait, maybe it's in Queens? Or maybe it's a different part of NYC. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in New Jersey? But New York City is in New York state. Wait, the coordinates are in New York City, so the state would be New York. Let me confirm. If I look up 40.6501, -73.9496 on a map, what's there? Maybe using a mapping service. But since I can't access that, I'll have to rely on memory. 

Another thought: The coordinates might be near the southern tip of Manhattan, like Battery Park. Battery Park is around 40.6984° N, 74.0448° W. No, that's still east. Wait, maybe it's in Brooklyn, near the Manhattan Bridge? Let me think. The coordinates given are 40.65, which is about 0.1 degrees south of 40.75. Since each degree of latitude is roughly 69 miles, 0.1 degrees is about 6.9 miles. So 40.65 is about 6.9 miles south of 40.75. If 40.75 is around the Empire State Building, then 40.65 would be near the southern part of Manhattan, maybe near the Financial District. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in New Jersey across the river, but the longitude is -73.95. New Jersey is east of Manhattan, but the longitude would be more like -74.0 or so. Wait, longitude -73.95 is west of -74.0, so that's actually east of the prime meridian? No, negative longitudes are west. So -73.95 is west of Greenwich. So, in the US, that's in the eastern part. 

Wait, New York City's longitude ranges from about -73.9 to -74.0. So -73.95 is within that range. So the coordinates 40.65, -73.95 are in New York City, specifically in Manhattan or Brooklyn. Therefore, the state is New York. 

I think the answer is New York State. Let me just make sure there's no other place with similar coordinates. For example, maybe a nearby state like New Jersey? But New Jersey is east of NYC, so the longitude would be more like -74.1 or so. The given longitude is -73.95, which is west of NYC's center, so still within NYC. Therefore, the state is New York.
