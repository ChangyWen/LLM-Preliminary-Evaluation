Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 41.0798° N, 81.5219° W are located. I need to figure out which state that is. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 41.0798, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -81.5219, which is in the western hemisphere.

I think the United States is in the northern and western hemispheres, so that makes sense. Now, I need to figure out which state. Let me recall some major cities and their coordinates. For example, Cleveland, Ohio is around 41.5° N, 81.7° W. Wait, the given coordinates are 41.0798 and -81.5219. Let me compare. Cleveland's latitude is a bit higher (41.5 vs. 41.08), but longitude is similar. Maybe it's a bit south of Cleveland?

Alternatively, maybe it's in Pennsylvania? But Pennsylvania's longitude is more around 79-80° W, I think. Let me check another approach. The longitude -81.5° W is in the eastern part of the US. States like Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania. Let me think about Ohio. Ohio's western border is along the Ohio River, and its eastern part is near Lake Erie. The coordinates given are 41.08° N, which is a bit south of Cleveland. Maybe it's in Ohio. Let me check another city. Akron, Ohio is around 41.08° N, 81.51° W. Oh, that's very close to the given coordinates. So Akron's coordinates are approximately 41.08° N, 81.51° W. The given longitude is -81.5219, which is just a bit west of Akron. So maybe the location is in Akron, Ohio. Therefore, the state would be Ohio. Let me confirm. If Akron is in Ohio, then yes. So the answer is Ohio.
