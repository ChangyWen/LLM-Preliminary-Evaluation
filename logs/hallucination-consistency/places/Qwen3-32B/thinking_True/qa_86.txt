Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 41.5725° N, 93.6105° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 41.5725, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -93.6105, which is in the western hemisphere. 

I think the United States is in the western hemisphere, so that makes sense. Now, I need to figure out which state this is. Let me recall some states and their approximate coordinates. For example, Iowa's capital is Des Moines. Wait, I've heard that Des Moines is around those coordinates. Let me check. 

Iowa is in the Midwest, and its approximate coordinates for the capital, Des Moines, are around 41.59° N, 93.62° W. The given coordinates are 41.5725 and -93.6105, which are very close to that. So that must be Des Moines, Iowa. Therefore, the state is Iowa. 

But wait, maybe I should verify. Let me think of other states nearby. Nebraska is to the north, Missouri to the south, Illinois to the east, and Kansas to the west. The coordinates given are in the central part of the US. Iowa's borders are roughly between 40°N to 43°N and 90°W to 96°W. The given latitude is 41.57, which is within that range, and the longitude is -93.61, which is also within Iowa's longitude range. 

Another way to check is to use a map or a geolocation tool, but since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. I'm pretty confident that Des Moines is the capital of Iowa, and those coordinates are very close to it. So the answer should be Iowa.
