Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 29.786° N, 95.3885° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 29.786, which is in the northern hemisphere, and the longitude is -95.3885, which is in the western hemisphere.

I think the United States is in the western hemisphere, so that makes sense. Now, I need to recall which states are around that latitude and longitude. Let me think. The latitude 29.786 is approximately 30 degrees north, which is a bit north of the Gulf of Mexico. States like Texas, Louisiana, maybe Florida? But longitude -95.3885... Let me break it down. The prime meridian is 0°, so negative longitudes are west of there. The 95° W line... I know that Texas is a large state that spans several longitudes. For example, Houston is around 29.76° N, 95.36° W. Wait, that's almost exactly the coordinates given here. So Houston, Texas is at approximately 29.76° N, 95.36° W. The coordinates provided are 29.786 and -95.3885, which are very close to Houston. 

So, if Houston is in Texas, then the coordinates must be in Texas. Let me double-check. Maybe I can think of other cities. New Orleans is in Louisiana, but its coordinates are around 30.0° N, 90.0° W. That's a longitude of -90, which is east of -95, so further east. So New Orleans is east of Houston. Therefore, 95.3885° W is west of New Orleans, which would place it in Texas. 

Another way to confirm: Texas's longitude ranges from about 93° W to 106° W, so -95.3885 is within that range. The latitude for Texas is roughly from 26° N to 36° N, so 29.786 is well within that. Therefore, the coordinates are in Texas. 

I think that's it. The place is in Texas. Let me just make sure there's no other state that could be there. Maybe part of Oklahoma? But Oklahoma is more north, around 33° N to 37° N, so higher latitude. The given latitude is 29.786, which is lower, so more southern. So definitely Texas. Yeah, I'm pretty confident it's Texas.
