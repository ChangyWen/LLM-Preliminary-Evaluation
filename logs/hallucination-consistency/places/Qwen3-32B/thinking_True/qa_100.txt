Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 47.6671° N, 117.433° W are located. First, I need to figure out what place that is. I remember that latitude and longitude can be looked up using various tools or databases. Since I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge.

Starting with the latitude: 47.6671° N. That's in the northern hemisphere. The longitude is 117.433° W, which is in the western hemisphere. Now, I need to think about the states in the United States that are in that general area. Let me recall the approximate coordinates of different states.

Washington state is in the Pacific Northwest. Its latitude ranges from about 45.5° N to 49° N, and longitude from around 116.9° W to 124.7° W. The given longitude is 117.433° W, which is just west of the 117° W line. So that's within Washington's longitude range. The latitude 47.6671° N is roughly in the middle of Washington's latitude range. 

Now, to narrow it down further. The coordinates might be in a specific city or area. Let me think of major cities in Washington. Seattle is around 47.6062° N, 122.3321° W. Spokane is at approximately 47.6588° N, 117.4287° W. Wait, that's very close to the given coordinates. The user's coordinates are 47.6671° N, 117.433° W. Comparing to Spokane's coordinates, the latitude is slightly higher (47.6671 vs. 47.6588) and the longitude is almost the same (117.433 vs. 117.4287). So this is probably near Spokane, Washington.

Therefore, the state should be Washington. Let me double-check. Are there any other states near that longitude? Idaho is east of Washington, so longitude would be more west, like 116° W or less. But 117.4° W is still within Washington's eastern part. So yes, the coordinates are in Washington state.
