Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the state where the coordinates 41.2627° N, 96.0529° W are located. Hmm, I need to figure this out. First, I remember that latitude and longitude can be used to pinpoint a location. The latitude here is 41.26 degrees north, and the longitude is 96.05 degrees west.

I think the United States is divided into states, and each state has a range of latitudes and longitudes. Let me recall some key states. For example, the central part of the US has states like Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, etc. The longitude of 96 degrees west is in the central time zone. Let me think about the approximate locations. 

Nebraska's longitude ranges from about 95°W to 104°W, and its latitude is roughly between 39°N to 43°N. The given latitude is 41.26, which is within Nebraska's range. The longitude is 96.05, which is also within Nebraska's western part. 

Wait, but I should double-check. Maybe it's in Kansas? Kansas is east of Nebraska. Kansas's longitude is from about 94°W to 102°W, but its latitude is from 37°N to 39°N. The given latitude is 41.26, which is higher than Kansas's northernmost point. So that's probably not Kansas. 

What about South Dakota? South Dakota's latitude ranges from about 43°N to 45°N, and longitude from 96°W to 104°W. The given latitude is 41.26, which is south of South Dakota. So maybe Nebraska is the correct state. 

Alternatively, maybe Iowa? Iowa's longitude is around 90°W to 96°W, and latitude from 40°N to 43°N. The longitude here is 96.05, which is right at the western edge of Iowa. But I think Iowa's western border is the Missouri River, which is around 96°W. However, the exact coordinates might be in Nebraska. 

Wait, I should check if there's a specific city or landmark at those coordinates. Let me try to visualize a map. If I take 41.26° N, 96.05° W, that's in the central part of the US. Maybe near the Nebraska-Kansas border? But since the latitude is 41.26, which is higher than Kansas's northern boundary (around 39°N to 40°N), it's more likely in Nebraska. 

Another way to confirm: I can think of the capital of Nebraska, which is Lincoln. Lincoln's coordinates are approximately 40.81° N, 96.68° W. The given latitude is 41.26, which is a bit north of Lincoln. So that would still be in Nebraska. 

Alternatively, maybe it's in the panhandle of Nebraska? The panhandle is the northern part of Nebraska, which extends northward. The latitude there would be higher. So 41.26 is within Nebraska's territory. 

I think the answer is Nebraska. Let me just make sure there's no other state that could be in that range. Missouri is further east, so longitude around 90°W to 95°W. So 96.05 is west of Missouri. Therefore, the state should be Nebraska.
