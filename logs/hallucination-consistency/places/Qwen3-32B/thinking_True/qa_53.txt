Okay, let's see. The user is asking which state the coordinates 30.0687° N, 89.9288° W are located in. First, I need to figure out where those coordinates point to.

I remember that latitude and longitude are used to specify locations on Earth. The latitude here is 30.0687 degrees north, and the longitude is 89.9288 degrees west. Let me think about the approximate regions these coordinates might be in. 

The latitude 30°N is a line that runs through the southern United States, parts of Mexico, and into Central America. The longitude 90°W is a line that goes through the central part of North America. For example, New Orleans is around 30°N and 90°W. Wait, New Orleans is in Louisiana. So maybe this location is in Louisiana?

But I should verify. Let me recall the approximate coordinates of some major cities. New Orleans is roughly 30.0687° N, 89.9288° W. That matches the given coordinates exactly. So if New Orleans is in Louisiana, then the state would be Louisiana. 

But just to be sure, maybe I should check if there are other places near that coordinate. For example, parts of Mississippi are also near that latitude and longitude. Let me think. The Mississippi River runs through both Louisiana and Mississippi. New Orleans is on the Mississippi River, so that's in Louisiana. The coordinates given are very close to New Orleans, so it's definitely in Louisiana. 

I don't think there's any other state that's exactly at those coordinates. So the answer should be Louisiana.
