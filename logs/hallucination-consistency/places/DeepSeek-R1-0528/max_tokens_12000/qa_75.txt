*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude: 30.442 and longitude: -91.1311.
 We know that the United States is in the Northern and Western Hemispheres, so positive latitude is north of the equator and negative longitude is west of the prime meridian.

 We are looking for a state in the USA. The coordinates are in the southern part of the USA (latitude around 30) and west of the prime meridian (negative longitude).

 Let's recall that in the USA:
   - Longitude becomes more negative as we go west.
   - Latitude becomes more positive as we go north.

 We can compare with known cities:
   - New Orleans, Louisiana is around 29.95° N, 90.07° W.

 The given point (30.442, -91.1311) is very close to that.

 Alternatively, we can use a reverse geocoding service, but since we are not connected to the internet, we rely on known coordinates.

 Known state boundaries in the area:
   - Louisiana: roughly between 28.9°N to 33°N and 88.8°W to 94°W.

 The point (30.442, -91.1311) falls within these boundaries.

 Therefore, the state is Louisiana.

 Final answer:
