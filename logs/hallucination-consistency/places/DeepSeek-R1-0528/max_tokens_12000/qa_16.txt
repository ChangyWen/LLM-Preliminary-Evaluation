*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given the latitude 44.9635 and longitude -93.2678.
 We know that the United States uses the latitude and longitude in the northern and western hemispheres.
 The coordinates correspond to a location in the USA because:
   - Latitude is positive (north of the equator)
   - Longitude is negative (west of the prime meridian)

 We can identify the state by using known geographic knowledge or by using a reverse geocoding service.
 However, without an external service, we can use common knowledge of major cities and their coordinates.

 Let's note:
   - The coordinates 44.9635° N, 93.2678° W are very close to the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota.
   - Specifically, the coordinates point to Minneapolis, which is in the state of Minnesota.

 Alternatively, we can recall that:
   - The approximate center of Minnesota is around 46°N, 94°W, but Minneapolis is a major city in the southeast part of the state.

 But to be precise, let's check known landmarks:
   - The coordinates 44.9635° N, 93.2678° W are actually the coordinates of the Minneapolis City Hall.

 Therefore, the state is Minnesota.

 Final answer:
Minnesota
