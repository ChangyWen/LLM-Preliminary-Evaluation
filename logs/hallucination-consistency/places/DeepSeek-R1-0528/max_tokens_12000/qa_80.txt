We are given latitude and longitude: 33.6096° N, 117.6551° W.
 We need to determine the U.S. state in which this location is situated.
 
 Steps:
 1. Recognize that the coordinates are in the Northern and Western hemispheres.
 2. We can use our knowledge of U.S. geography: 
    - The latitude 33.6096° N is around the southern part of the United States.
    - The longitude 117.6551° W is on the west coast.
 3. We can think of major west coast states: California, Oregon, Washington.
    - Southern California is around 33° to 34° N latitude and around 117° to 118° W longitude.
 4. Specifically, the city of Irvine, California is near these coordinates. Also, the city of Costa Mesa and Newport Beach are in that area.
