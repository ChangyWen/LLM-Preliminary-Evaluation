*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 27.2796 and longitude -80.3884.
 Latitude 27.2796 is positive, meaning it's in the northern hemisphere.
 Longitude -80.3884 is negative, meaning it's in the western hemisphere.

 The coordinates are in the United States because the longitude is around -80 (which is typical for the East Coast) and the latitude is around 27 (which is in the southern part of the US).

 We can narrow down to Florida because:
   - Florida is the southernmost state on the East Coast (excluding Hawaii and territories).
   - The latitude 27.2796 is within the range of Florida (approximately 24.5째N to 31째N).
   - The longitude -80.3884 is within the range of Florida (approximately -80째 to -87째W).

 Specifically, we can check the city of Fort Pierce, which is around these coordinates.

 Alternatively, we can use reverse geocoding, but since the question asks for the state, and we know that Florida is the state that contains these coordinates, we can conclude.

 However, to be precise, let's note:
   - The coordinates (27.2796, -80.3884) are located in Fort Pierce, Florida.

 Therefore, the state is Florida.

 Final Answer:
Florida
