*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude and longitude: 42.9619, -85.6562
 We can use this to determine the state in the United States.
 One common approach is to use a reverse geocoding service, but since we are in a text-based environment, we can use known geographic information.

 However, note that without an external service, we might rely on known boundaries or approximate the state by well-known cities.

 Alternatively, we can recall that the coordinates (42.96, -85.65) are near the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan.

 Let's verify with some known facts:
 - The state of Michigan has a latitude range of approximately 41.7 to 48.3 and longitude range of approximately -90.4 to -82.4.
 - The coordinates (42.9619, -85.6562) are within these ranges.

 Moreover, the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan is located at approximately 42.96° N, 85.66° W.

 Therefore, we can conclude that the location is in Michigan.

 However, to be thorough, we can also consider if it could be in a neighboring state. But note:
 - To the south is Indiana (latitude around 41.7 to 41.8 at the northern tip, but our point is 42.96, which is well north of that).
 - To the east is Ohio, but Ohio's longitude is mostly east of -85 (i.e., less negative) and its northern border is around 42.0 to 42.5. Our point is at 42.96, which is north of Ohio's northern border (which is about 42.0 to 42.5).
 - To the west is Wisconsin and Illinois, but Wisconsin's longitude is more negative (west) and its eastern border is at about -87.5 to -92, so our point at -85.65 is too far east.

 Therefore, the coordinates (42.9619, -85.6562) are in the state of Michigan.

 Final answer: Michigan
