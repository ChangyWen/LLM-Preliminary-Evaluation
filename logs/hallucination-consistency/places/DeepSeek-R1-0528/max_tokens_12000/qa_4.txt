*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given the coordinates: latitude 25.784 and longitude -80.2101.
 Latitude 25.784 is in the northern hemisphere (positive) and longitude -80.2101 is in the western hemisphere (negative).
 We need to determine the U.S. state that contains these coordinates.

 Steps:
 1. Recognize that these coordinates are in the United States because the longitude is around -80 (which is in the range of US longitudes) and the latitude is around 25-26 (which is typical for the southern part of Florida).

 2. We can use our knowledge of U.S. geography: 
    - Florida is the southernmost state in the eastern U.S. and includes the Everglades and Miami.
    - The latitude of 25.784 degrees north is typical for the Miami area (which is around 25.76째N).
    - The longitude of -80.2101째 is also typical for Miami (which is around 80.19째W to 80.21째W).

 3. Therefore, the coordinates (25.784, -80.2101) are in the state of Florida.

 However, to be precise, we can note that the coordinates are very close to the city of Miami. Miami is in Florida.

 Final answer: Florida.

 We will output the answer in a new line at the end.
