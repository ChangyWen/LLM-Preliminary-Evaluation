We are given latitude 41.4764 and longitude -81.6805.
 Latitude: positive 41.4764 is north of the equator.
 Longitude: negative 81.6805 is west of the prime meridian.

 We are trying to find the state in the United States that this point lies in.

 We know that the state of Ohio is located in the Midwest and has major cities like Cleveland. The coordinates for Cleveland, Ohio are approximately:
   Latitude: 41.4993° N, Longitude: 81.6944° W.

 The given coordinates (41.4764, -81.6805) are very close to Cleveland, Ohio. Therefore, we can conclude that the point is in Ohio.

 However, to be thorough, we can note that the state of Ohio has the following approximate bounding box:
   Northernmost: about 42.0° N
   Southernmost: about 38.5° N
   Westernmost: about -84.8° W
   Easternmost: about -80.5° W

 Our point (41.4764, -81.6805) falls within:
   Latitude: 38.5 to 42.0 -> 41.4764 is within this range.
   Longitude: -84.8 to -80.5 -> -81.6805 is within this range.

 Therefore, the state is Ohio.
