*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 43.0822 and longitude -89.393.
 Latitude 43.0822 is positive, which in the northern hemisphere (since positive latitude is north of the equator).
 Longitude -89.393 is negative, which in the western hemisphere (negative longitude is west of the prime meridian).

 The coordinates (43.0822, -89.393) are in the United States because:
   - The latitude is around 43 degrees north (which is within the continental US, which ranges from about 24°N to 49°N).
   - The longitude is around 89 degrees west (which is within the US, which ranges from about 66°W to 125°W).

 We can recall that the state of Wisconsin is located in the northern part of the US and has a capital at Madison, which is approximately at 43.0731° N, 89.4012° W.

 Comparing:
   - Given latitude: 43.0822
   - Given longitude: -89.393

 The coordinates are very close to Madison, Wisconsin.

 Therefore, the place is in the state of Wisconsin.
