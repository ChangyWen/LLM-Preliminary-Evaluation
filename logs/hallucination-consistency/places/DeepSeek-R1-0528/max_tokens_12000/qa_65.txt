*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 40.5961 and longitude -75.4756.
 The coordinates are in decimal degrees. The positive latitude indicates north of the equator, and the negative longitude indicates west of the prime meridian.
 We are to determine the U.S. state in which these coordinates lie.

 Steps:
 1. Recognize that the coordinates are within the United States because the longitude is negative (west) and the latitude is around 40 (north).
 2. We can use reverse geocoding to find the state. However, without an API, we rely on known geographic boundaries.

 Known facts:
 - The coordinates (40.5961, -75.4756) are near the city of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
 - Bethlehem is located in the state of Pennsylvania.

 Alternatively, we can reason by well-known landmarks:
 - The coordinates are in the eastern part of the United States, specifically in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania.

 Therefore, the state is Pennsylvania.

 However, note that the problem requires the final answer in a new line at the end.

 Let's confirm with a quick check: 
   Bethlehem, PA has coordinates approximately 40.6259째 N, 75.3705째 W. The given point (40.5961, -75.4756) is very close to Bethlehem and within the state boundaries of Pennsylvania.

 Final Answer:
 Pennsylvania
