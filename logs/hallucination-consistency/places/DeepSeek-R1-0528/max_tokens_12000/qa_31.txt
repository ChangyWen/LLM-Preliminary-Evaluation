*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 39.1413 and longitude -84.506.
 In the United States, latitude is typically positive for the northern hemisphere and negative for the southern, and longitude is negative for the western hemisphere (west of the prime meridian). 
 The coordinates 39.1413 N (latitude) and 84.506 W (longitude) suggest a location in the United States.

 We know that the state of Ohio is around the 39th parallel north and the 84th meridian west. Specifically, the city of Cincinnati, Ohio is located at approximately 39.1031° N, 84.5120° W.

 Comparing the given coordinates (39.1413, -84.506) with Cincinnati, we see:
   Latitude: 39.1413 is very close to 39.1031 (a difference of about 0.0382 degrees, which is about 4.2 miles north of Cincinnati).
   Longitude: -84.506 is very close to -84.5120 (a difference of about 0.006 degrees, which is less than half a mile).

 Therefore, this location is in the state of Ohio.

 However, let's double-check the borders. The Ohio-Kentucky border is the Ohio River, which runs at approximately 39.1° N at Cincinnati. The given latitude (39.1413) is north of the river (since 39.1413 > 39.1). Also, the Ohio-Indiana border is to the west, but the longitude -84.506 is within the range of Ohio.

 So the place is in Ohio.

 Final answer:
Ohio
