*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 39.7771 and longitude -86.1458.
 We know that the United States uses the coordinate system where latitude is north and longitude is west (for negative values).
 We are to determine the state in the USA that contains these coordinates.

 Steps:
 1. Recognize that the coordinates are in the USA because the longitude is negative (west of the prime meridian) and the latitude is positive (north of the equator).
 2. We can use known geographic boundaries or a geocoding service, but since we are to reason, we can recall that:
    - The latitude 39.7771 is around 39°46'37.56" N.
    - The longitude -86.1458 is around 86°08'44.88" W.
 3. We can associate these coordinates with a major city or region we know. Alternatively, we can think about the central part of the United States.

 Known facts:
 - The state of Indiana is located in the Midwest and has a latitude range from about 37.8° N to 41.8° N and a longitude from about -84.8° W to -88.0° W.
 - The city of Indianapolis, the capital of Indiana, is located at approximately 39.7684° N, -86.1581° W.

 Comparing:
   Given: 39.7771° N, -86.1458° W
   Indianapolis: 39.7684° N, -86.1581° W

 The given coordinates are very close to those of Indianapolis. Therefore, the location is in the state of Indiana.

 Final answer: Indiana
