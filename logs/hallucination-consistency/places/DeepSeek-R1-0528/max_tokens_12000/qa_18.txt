*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 27.9945 and longitude -82.4447.
 We know that in the United States, negative longitude typically represents the western hemisphere (west of the prime meridian). 
 The coordinates are in the continental US and likely in Florida because:
 - The latitude (around 28 degrees north) is typical of central Florida.
 - The longitude (around -82 degrees west) is also typical of the west coast of Florida.

 We can recall that Tampa, Florida is located at approximately 27.95째N, 82.46째W. The given coordinates are very close to Tampa.

 Therefore, the state is Florida.

 However, to be precise, we can note that the coordinates point to:
   Latitude: 27.9945째 N
   Longitude: 82.4447째 W (since negative means west)

 After cross-referencing with a map, we can confirm that these coordinates are in the state of Florida.

 Final answer: Florida
