*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given the latitude: 29.4632 and longitude: -98.5238.
 We need to find out which U.S. state this coordinate is located in.

 Steps:
 1. Recognize that the coordinates are in decimal degrees (latitude positive for north, longitude negative for west).
 2. The latitude 29.4632° N and longitude -98.5238° W are in the continental United States.
 3. We can use reverse geocoding to determine the state. However, without using an online service, we can rely on known landmarks or approximate boundaries.

 Known landmark:
   The coordinates (29.4632, -98.5238) are very close to the city of San Antonio, Texas.
   For example, the Alamo in San Antonio is approximately at (29.4258, -98.4861). Our point is nearby.

 4. Alternatively, we can use a map of U.S. states and their approximate boundaries:
    - Texas is a large state that spans from approximately 25.84°N to 36.5°N and from 93.5°W to 106.6°W.
    - Our point (29.4632°N, -98.5238°W) falls within these boundaries.

 5. Therefore, the state is Texas.

 Final Answer:
   Texas
