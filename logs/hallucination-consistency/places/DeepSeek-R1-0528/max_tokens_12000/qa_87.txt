*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 33.5719 and longitude -117.1909.
 Latitude 33.5719 is positive, which in the northern hemisphere (since positive latitude is north, negative is south).
 Longitude -117.1909 is negative, which in the western hemisphere (negative for west, positive for east).

 We are in the United States because the coordinates are in the northern and western hemispheres and within the typical range for the US.

 We can use reverse geocoding to find the state. However, without an external service, we can rely on known landmarks or approximate boundaries.

 Alternatively, we can note:
 - The coordinates are approximately 33.57°N, 117.19°W.

 By comparing with known cities:
   The coordinates are very close to the city of San Clemente in Orange County, California.

 Let's validate:
   San Clemente, CA is around 33.43°N, 117.61°W. However, let's check the exact given point.

 Alternatively, we can note that the coordinates are near the coast of Southern California.

 Another known landmark: Camp Pendleton is in the area. The coordinates 33.5719, -117.1909 are within California.

 How to confirm without a service?
   We know that California spans from about 32.5°N to 42°N and from about 114.5°W to 124.5°W.

   The given point: 
     Latitude: 33.5719°N  -> between 32.5 and 42 -> within California's latitude range.
     Longitude: -117.1909°W -> between 114.5°W and 124.5°W -> within California's longitude range.

   Therefore, it must be in California.

 However, let's be cautious: there might be other states with similar coordinates? 
   But note: the latitude 33.57°N is too far south for Oregon (which starts around 42°N) and too far north for the Mexican border (which is at 32.5°N). 
   Also, the longitude is too far west for Arizona (which is east of 114.5°W) and too far east for the middle of the Pacific.

   Therefore, the state is California.

 Final answer: California

 But note: We must be precise because there are border regions. However, the coordinates are well within California.

 Let's double-check with a known landmark: the coordinates are very close to the city of Temecula? Actually, Temecula is at 33.4936°N, 117.1484°W. That's very close.

 Alternatively, we can use an online tool to check, but the problem requires an answer without external tools? 

 Since we are to give an answer without external tools, we rely on our knowledge of U.S. geography.

 Conclusion: California

 However, note that the longitude is about 117.19°W. This is in the western part of the state, near the coast? Actually, the coast at that latitude is around 117.3°W to 117.4°W? So the given longitude is 117.1909°W, which is a bit east of the coast. But that still falls in California.

 Therefore, the state is California.

 Let's write the answer as required.
