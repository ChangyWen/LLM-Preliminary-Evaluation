*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given the latitude and longitude: 36.1715, -86.7842.
 To determine the state, we can use reverse geocoding. However, since I don't have direct access to a geocoding service in this environment, I'll rely on known knowledge.

 The coordinates (36.1715° N, 86.7842° W) are in the United States.

 Specifically, I recognize that the city of Nashville, Tennessee is located at approximately 36.1627° N, 86.7816° W.

 Therefore, the given coordinates are very close to Nashville, which is the capital of Tennessee.

 Hence, the state is Tennessee.

 Final answer:
 Tennessee
