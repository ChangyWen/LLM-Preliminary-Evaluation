*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 30.3322 and longitude -81.6749.
 To determine the state, we note that the coordinates are in the United States because the longitude is negative (which is west of the prime meridian) and the latitude is around 30 degrees (which is in the southern part of the US).
 We can recall that the state of Florida is located in the southeastern part of the US and has coordinates that fit this description.
 Specifically, the city of Jacksonville, Florida is known to be around 30 degrees north and 81 degrees west.
 Therefore, the place with these coordinates is in Florida.
Final answer: Florida
