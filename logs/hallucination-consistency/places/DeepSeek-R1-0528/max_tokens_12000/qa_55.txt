*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 41.7661 and longitude -72.6834.
 We know that in the United States, latitude and longitude can be used to determine the state.
 The coordinates are in the northern hemisphere (positive latitude) and western hemisphere (negative longitude).
 We can recall that the state of Connecticut is located in the northeastern United States and has major cities like Hartford.
 Specifically, the coordinates (41.7661, -72.6834) are near the city of Hartford, Connecticut.
 Let's verify by recalling that Hartford, CT has coordinates approximately around 41.76°N, 72.68°W (but note the negative sign for west).

 Alternatively, we can use a known fact: the state of Connecticut is bounded roughly between:
   Latitude: 41.0°N to 42.0°N
   Longitude: 71.8°W to 73.7°W

 The given point (41.7661, -72.6834) falls within these boundaries.

 Therefore, the state is Connecticut.

 Final answer:
 Connecticut
