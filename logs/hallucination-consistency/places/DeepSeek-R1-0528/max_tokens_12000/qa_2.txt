*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 34.1141 and longitude -118.4068.
 This coordinate is in the United States because the longitude is negative (which is west of the prime meridian) and the latitude is positive (which is north of the equator).
 We know that California is a state on the west coast of the United States and that Los Angeles is a major city in California with coordinates around 34° N, 118° W.
 Specifically, the coordinates 34.1141° N, 118.4068° W are in the vicinity of Los Angeles, California.
 Therefore, the state is California.

 However, to be precise, we can note that the coordinates are for the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, California, which is at approximately 34.118° N, 118.300° W. But our given longitude is -118.4068, which is about 118.4068° W. This is very close to the coordinates of the Griffith Observatory, but let's check the exact location.

 Alternatively, we can use reverse geocoding knowledge: 
 - Latitude 34.1141 is about 34°6'50.76" N
 - Longitude -118.4068 is about 118°24'24.48" W

 This location is in the city of Los Angeles, which is in the state of California.

 Therefore, the state is California.

 We will output the answer as required.
