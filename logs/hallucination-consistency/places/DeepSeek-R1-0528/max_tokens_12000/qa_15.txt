*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude and longitude: 32.8313° N, 117.1222° W.
 We need to determine the U.S. state that this location is in.

 Steps:
 1. Recognize that the coordinates are in the United States because the longitude is west (negative) and the latitude is in the northern hemisphere (positive).
 2. We can use a reverse geocoding service or a known database to map the coordinates to a state.
 3. However, without an external API, we can rely on known landmarks or approximate boundaries.

 But note: 
  - Latitude 32.8313 N and longitude 117.1222 W are coordinates that are very close to a well-known location: 
    San Diego, California.

 Let's verify with approximate boundaries of California:
  - California extends from approximately 32.5° N to 42° N in latitude and from about 114.8° W to 124.4° W in longitude.

 The given coordinates (32.8313, -117.1222) are within these boundaries.

 Additionally, we can note that the coordinates are near:
  - San Diego International Airport (SAN) at approximately 32.7338° N, 117.1933° W.
  - Or the city center of San Diego.

 Therefore, the state is California.

 Final answer:
California
