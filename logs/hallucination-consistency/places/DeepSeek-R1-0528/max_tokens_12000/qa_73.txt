*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 42.1155 and longitude -72.5395.
 We know that in the United States, latitude and longitude can help identify the state.
 The coordinates (42.1155, -72.5395) are in the northern hemisphere (positive latitude) and western hemisphere (negative longitude, so west of the prime meridian).
 
 We can recall that the state of Massachusetts is known for having a latitude around 42°N and longitude around 71°W to 73°W. Specifically, the city of Springfield, MA is around 42.1015° N, 72.5898° W. These coordinates are very close to that.
 
 Alternatively, we can think about the general region:
 - New York is to the west (longitude around 73°W to 79°W, but the western part of Massachusetts borders New York).
 - Connecticut is to the south (latitude around 41°N to 42°N) and has longitude similar to western Massachusetts.
 
 Given the longitude of -72.5395 (which is about 72.5°W) and latitude 42.1155 (which is about 42.1°N), this falls within the boundaries of Massachusetts.
 
 Specifically, let's compare with known cities:
 - Springfield, MA: approximately 42.1015° N, 72.5898° W -> very close.
 
 Therefore, the state is Massachusetts.

 Final answer: Massachusetts
