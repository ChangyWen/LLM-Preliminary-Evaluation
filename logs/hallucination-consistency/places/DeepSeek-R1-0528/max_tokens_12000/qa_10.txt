*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 42.3188 and longitude -71.0852.
 The coordinates are in decimal degrees. The latitude is positive, meaning it's in the Northern Hemisphere. The longitude is negative, meaning it's in the Western Hemisphere.
 This location is in the United States because the longitude is around -71 (which is the east coast of the US) and the latitude is around 42 (which is in the northern part of the east coast).

 We can recall that the state of Massachusetts is known for having the city of Boston, which is around these coordinates.
 Specifically, we can check that Boston, MA, has coordinates approximately at 42.36° N, 71.06° W (note that the given longitude is -71.0852, which is about 71.0852° W).

 Therefore, the state is Massachusetts.

 However, note that the coordinates (42.3188, -71.0852) are very close to the city of Boston. Let's verify by comparing to known landmarks:
 - The TD Garden (a well-known arena in Boston) is at approximately 42.3663° N, 71.0622° W. 
 - But our point is at 42.3188, which is a bit south of that. 

 Looking at the coordinates more precisely, 42.3188 is about 42°19'07.68" N and 71.0852° W is about 71°05'06.72" W.

 This location is actually in the city of Boston, specifically in the neighborhood of Dorchester. For example:
 - The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum is located at approximately 42.316° N, 71.035° W, which is very close.

 However, let's not rely solely on landmarks. We can use a reverse geocoding service in our mind: we know that the state boundaries in the US are well-defined. The coordinates (42.3188, -71.0852) fall within the boundaries of Massachusetts.

 Therefore, the state is Massachusetts.

 Final answer: Massachusetts
