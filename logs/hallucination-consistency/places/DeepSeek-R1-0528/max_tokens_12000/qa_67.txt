*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 33.5279 and longitude -86.7971.
 Latitude is positive, which in the northern hemisphere usually means north of the equator.
 Longitude is negative, which in the western hemisphere usually means west of the prime meridian.

 In the United States, negative longitude is west and positive latitude is north.

 We know that the coordinates are in the United States because of the specific range of these numbers.

 We can recall that the state of Alabama is located around the 33rd parallel north and the 86th meridian west.

 Let's verify by checking known cities. Birmingham, Alabama, is a major city in the state. The coordinates for Birmingham are approximately:
   Latitude: 33.5207° N, Longitude: 86.8025° W

 The given coordinates (33.5279, -86.7971) are very close to these, which confirms that the location is in Birmingham, Alabama.

 Therefore, the state is Alabama.

 Final answer:
 Alabama
