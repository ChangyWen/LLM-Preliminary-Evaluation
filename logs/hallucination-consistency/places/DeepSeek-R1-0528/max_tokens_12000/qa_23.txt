*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude and longitude: 38.6359 (North) and -90.2451 (West).
 We can use reverse geocoding to determine the state. However, since we don't have a direct API, we can use known geographical knowledge or approximate by comparing with known cities.

 Alternatively, we can recall that the coordinates are for a well-known place or use a mental map.

 Note:
 - Latitude 38.6359 N is about 38 degrees north. In the United States, this is roughly in the central part, around states like Missouri, Illinois, etc.
 - Longitude -90.2451 W is about 90 degrees west, which is near the Mississippi River and the city of St. Louis.

 Specifically, the coordinates (38.6359, -90.2451) are very close to the city of St. Louis, Missouri.

 Let's verify with known landmarks:
 The Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri has coordinates approximately 38.6247° N, 90.1848° W. Our given point is near that.

 Therefore, it is safe to say that the coordinates are in the state of Missouri.

 Final answer: Missouri
