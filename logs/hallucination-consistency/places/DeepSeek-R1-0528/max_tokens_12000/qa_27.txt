*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 38.5677 and longitude -121.4685.
 Latitude is positive, so it's in the Northern Hemisphere.
 Longitude is negative, so it's in the Western Hemisphere.

 We are to determine the state in the United States that contains this point.

 We know that the United States uses the WGS84 coordinate system.

 Let's recall:
 - The latitude of 38.5677 is about 38.57 degrees north.
 - The longitude of -121.4685 is about 121.47 degrees west.

 We can look up known locations or use a geocoding tool, but since we are reasoning:

 Known cities and states:
 - Sacramento, California is around 38.58° N, 121.49° W.

 Therefore, the point (38.5677, -121.4685) is very close to Sacramento, which is in California.

 However, to be sure, we can consider:
 - The state of California is located in the western US and has a wide range of latitudes and longitudes.

 Alternatively, we can use a reverse geocoding service or a map, but since we are to reason:

 We can check the boundaries of the states. However, without a map, we rely on known facts.

 Let's compare with neighboring states:
 - Oregon is to the north (latitude above 42°N at the California border, so too north).
 - Nevada is to the east (longitude more east, i.e., less negative, starting around 120°W at the border and going east). 
   The given longitude is -121.4685, which is west of 120°W (because -121.4685 is more negative than -120). 
   Therefore, it is west of the California-Nevada border (which runs along the 120th meridian west in the north, but in the south it's a bit different). 
   Actually, the California-Nevada border is at 120°W in the north and then angles to the southeast. But note that -121.4685 is west of 120°W, so it's in California.

 - To the south is Mexico, and to the west is the Pacific Ocean.

 Since the point is inland and near Sacramento, it is in California.

 Therefore, the state is California.

 Final answer: California
