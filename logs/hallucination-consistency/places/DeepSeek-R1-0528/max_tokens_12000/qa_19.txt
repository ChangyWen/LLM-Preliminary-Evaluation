*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given the coordinates: latitude 39.762 and longitude -104.8758.
 We know that in the United States, latitude is positive for the northern hemisphere and longitude is negative for the western hemisphere (so this is west of the prime meridian).

 We are to determine the state in the USA where these coordinates lie.

 We note that the coordinates are:
   Latitude: 39.762° N
   Longitude: -104.8758° W

 We can recall that the city of Denver, Colorado is located at approximately 39.7392° N, 104.9903° W. 
 The given longitude is -104.8758, which is very close to Denver's longitude (within about 0.1 degrees). 
 Also, the latitude 39.762 is very close to Denver's latitude (about 0.02 degrees difference).

 Alternatively, we can use a reverse geocoding service or a known database of state boundaries. However, since we are not using an API, we rely on known facts.

 The coordinates 39.762, -104.8758 are in the United States and specifically in the state of Colorado.

 Let's verify with some known boundaries:
 - The state of Colorado is roughly between 37°N and 41°N latitude, and between 102°W and 109°W longitude.
 - The given latitude (39.762) falls within 37 to 41, and the longitude (-104.8758) falls within 102 to 109 (in absolute value: 104.8758 is between 102 and 109).

 Therefore, we can confidently say that the location is in Colorado.

 Final answer:
Colorado
