*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude and longitude: 35.2083, -80.8303.
 We need to determine the state in the United States that contains this point.
 Steps:
 1. Recognize that the coordinates are in decimal degrees.
 2. The longitude is negative, which indicates the Western Hemisphere (so in the USA, this would be west of the prime meridian).
 3. We can use reverse geocoding to find the state. However, without an external service, we can rely on known geographic boundaries or approximate knowledge.

 Known facts:
 - The coordinates (35.2083, -80.8303) are near Charlotte, North Carolina.
 - Let's verify by recalling that North Carolina is around 35°N to 36.5°N and between about 75°W to 84°W.

 Since the longitude is -80.8303 (which is 80.8303°W) and latitude 35.2083°N, it falls within the boundaries of North Carolina.

 But to be sure, we can check major cities:
   - Charlotte, NC is approximately at 35.2271° N, 80.8431° W.

 Our point (35.2083, -80.8303) is very close to Charlotte, NC.

 Therefore, the state is North Carolina.

 Final answer:
 North Carolina
