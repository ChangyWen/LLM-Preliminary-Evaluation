*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 41.8375 and longitude -87.6866.
 Latitude 41.8375 is in the northern hemisphere (positive) and longitude -87.6866 is in the western hemisphere (negative).
 We know that the coordinates correspond to a location in the United States because the longitude is around -87 (which is the central part of the US, near Chicago).

 Specifically, we can recall that Chicago, Illinois is located at approximately 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W.
 Our given coordinates (41.8375, -87.6866) are very close to that.

 Let's check the state: Illinois.

 However, to be thorough, we can also note that the state of Illinois has a range of latitudes and longitudes.
 The approximate bounding box for Illinois:
   Northernmost: around 42.5° N
   Southernmost: around 37° N
   Westernmost: around -91.5° W
   Easternmost: around -87.5° W

 The given longitude is -87.6866, which is just west of -87.5. But note that the eastern border of Illinois is the Wabash River and Lake Michigan, and the longitude at the eastern edge of the state is about -87.5° W. However, the city of Chicago is at about -87.65° W, which is within the state.

 Since the coordinates are very close to Chicago, and within the known boundaries of Illinois, we can confidently say the state is Illinois.

 Therefore, the answer is Illinois.

 Final answer:
 Illinois
