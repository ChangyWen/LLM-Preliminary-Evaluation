*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 41.1918 and longitude -73.1954.
 Longitude is negative, which typically indicates a location in the Western Hemisphere (like the United States).
 Latitude 41.1918 is in the northern hemisphere.

 In the United States, we can use these coordinates to determine the state.

 We note that:
 - The coordinates are in the vicinity of the northeastern United States.
 - Specifically, let's recall that New York City is around 40.7° N, 74.0° W, and Connecticut is also nearby.

 We can use reverse geocoding or known landmarks to help.

 However, without an API, we can rely on known cities:
 - The coordinates 41.1918° N, 73.1954° W are very close to the city of Greenwich, Connecticut.

 Let's verify with a known landmark:
 - The town of Greenwich, CT has a latitude around 41.026° N and longitude 73.628° W? Wait, let me double-check.

 Alternatively, we can note:
 - The coordinates (41.1918, -73.1954) are in the state of Connecticut.

 How?
 - The latitude 41.1918 is above 41°N and the longitude -73.1954 is between 72°W and 73.5°W approximately? Actually, let's look at the boundaries.

 But note: The longitude given is -73.1954, which is 73.1954° west. This is within the range of Connecticut.

 Let me compare with some cities:
 - Stamford, CT: approximately 41.05° N, 73.54° W.
 - Greenwich, CT: approximately 41.026° N, 73.628° W? That doesn't match exactly.

 Alternatively, let's look at the coordinates for Bridgeport, CT: about 41.18° N, 73.19° W. That is very close.

 Indeed, Bridgeport, CT has:
   Latitude: 41.1865° N
   Longitude: -73.1952° W

 Our point (41.1918, -73.1954) is extremely close to Bridgeport, CT.

 Therefore, the state is Connecticut.

 Final Answer:
 Connecticut
