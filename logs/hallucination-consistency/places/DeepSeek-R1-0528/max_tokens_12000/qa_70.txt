*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 34.0378 and longitude -80.9036.
 We know that in the United States, latitude and longitude can be used to determine the state.
 The coordinates are:
   Latitude: 34.0378 (North)
   Longitude: -80.9036 (West)

 We can use a reverse geocoding service or a database to find the state. However, since I don't have real-time access, I can use known geographical knowledge.

 Let's break it down:
 - Latitude 34.0378 is approximately 34 degrees north. This is in the southern part of the United States.
 - Longitude -80.9036 is approximately 81 degrees west. This is on the east coast.

 We know that the state of South Carolina is located in the southeastern United States and is bounded by:
   - North Carolina to the north
   - Georgia to the south and west
   - The Atlantic Ocean to the east

 Major cities in South Carolina include Columbia (the capital) and Charleston.

 Looking at the coordinates for Columbia, South Carolina:
   - Columbia, SC: approximately 34.0007° N, 81.0348° W

 The given coordinates (34.0378, -80.9036) are very close to Columbia. In fact, they are within the state of South Carolina.

 Additionally, we can note:
   - The northern border of South Carolina is at approximately 35° N (with North Carolina).
   - The southern border is at approximately 32° N (with Georgia).
   - The given latitude (34.0378) is between 32° N and 35° N, so it fits.

 Therefore, the place with these coordinates is in South Carolina.

 Final answer:
South Carolina
