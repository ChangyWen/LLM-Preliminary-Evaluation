*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 38.9047 and longitude -77.0163.
 Latitude 38.9047 is positive, which indicates it's in the Northern Hemisphere.
 Longitude -77.0163 is negative, which indicates it's in the Western Hemisphere.

 This coordinate is within the United States. We need to find out which state.

 We know that Washington, D.C. has coordinates approximately around 38.9072° N, 77.0369° W. But let's check:

 The given coordinates (38.9047, -77.0163) are very close to the coordinates of Washington, D.C.

 However, note that Washington, D.C. is not a state but a federal district. But the question asks for the state.

 But wait, let me double-check: the coordinates 38.9047, -77.0163 are actually the coordinates of the White House in Washington, D.C.

 Since Washington, D.C. is not part of any state, we must note that the question might be expecting "District of Columbia" or "Washington D.C.".

 However, the question asks for the state. But Washington, D.C. is not in a state. So we have to be careful.

 Alternatively, let's check if these coordinates might be in a nearby state by mistake? But the coordinates are clearly in the District of Columbia.

 We can use reverse geocoding to confirm. But based on common knowledge:

 - The latitude and longitude correspond to Washington, D.C.

 Therefore, the place is in the District of Columbia. Since the question asks for the state, and the District of Columbia is not a state, we must consider:

 - If the question requires the state, then we note that there is no state. However, sometimes people might refer to it as Washington, D.C. and it is often listed as DC.

 But note: the question says "state", and the District of Columbia is a federal district, not a state.

 However, in many contexts, especially when filling out forms, Washington, D.C. is treated as a state equivalent. It is common to see "DC" as the state in mailing addresses.

 So, the answer should be: District of Columbia (abbreviated as DC). But the question does not specify abbreviation.

 Since the question asks for the state, and the location is not in a state, we must be precise. However, the expected answer might be "District of Columbia" or "Washington D.C.".

 But note: the coordinates are definitely in the District of Columbia.

 Therefore, we can say:

 The place is located in the District of Columbia.

 However, if we are to give the state equivalent for mailing purposes, we would say "DC".

 But the question does not specify. Let's see the requirement: "What state does the place ... located in?"

 Since it's not in a state, we have to say it's in the District of Columbia.

 But note: the question might be expecting the state name if it were in a state, but it's not. So we must report the correct jurisdiction.

 Final answer: District of Columbia

 However, let's check with a geocoding service for confirmation? (We can do a quick mental check: the White House is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500, and its coordinates are approximately 38.8977° N, 77.0365° W. The given coordinates are 38.9047, -77.0163, which is about 1.5 km northeast of the White House. That is still within Washington, D.C.)

 Therefore, we conclude: District of Columbia.

 But note: the question says "state". We can also note that the District of Columbia is commonly referred to as DC and is treated as a state in many contexts. So we will output:

 District of Columbia

 However, to be precise, we are not in a state but in a federal district. But the question might be using "state" in a broad sense? If we are to choose among the 50 states and the District of Columbia, then it's the District of Columbia.

 So, the final answer is:

 District of Columbia

 But wait, let me check the coordinates again: 38.9047 N, 77.0163 W. This is in the northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C., near the Logan Circle neighborhood. So definitely D.C.

 Therefore, we write:

 District of Columbia

 However, the question says "state", and if we are to be very strict, we might have to say "none" or "not in a state". But that is not common. The expected answer is likely "District of Columbia" or "DC".

 Since the problem does not specify abbreviation, we write:

 District of Columbia

 But note: the instructions say to give the final answer in a new line at the end.

 So we will write:

 District of Columbia

 However, let me check if there's any chance it could be in Virginia or Maryland? The coordinates are:

 Latitude: 38.9047 (which is about 38°54'16.92" N)
 Longitude: -77.0163 (which is about 77°0'58.68" W)

 The boundaries of Washington, D.C. are approximately:

 - Northern boundary: 38.9958° N (near Silver Spring, MD)
 - Southern boundary: 38.8036° N (near Alexandria, VA)
 - Western boundary: 77.1197° W (near Falls Church, VA)
 - Eastern boundary: 76.9094° W (near Capitol Heights, MD)

 Our point: 
   Latitude 38.9047 is between 38.8036 and 38.9958 -> within the north-south bounds.
   Longitude -77.0163 is between -77.1197 and -76.9094? 

 Note: longitudes are negative in the western hemisphere. So -77.0163 is equivalent to 77.0163° W.

 The western boundary of D.C. is 77.1197° W (which is -77.1197) and the eastern boundary is 76.9094° W (which is -76.9094). 

 Since -77.0163 is between -77.1197 and -76.9094? Actually, let's compare:

 -77.0163 is greater than -77.1197 (because -77.0163 is to the right on the number line) and less than -76.9094? 

 Actually, -77.0163 is less than -76.9094? (No, because -77.0163 is more negative than -76.9094). 

 Wait, let me compare:

 -77.0163 vs -76.9094: 
   -77.0163 is more negative, so it is to the west of -76.9094.

 The eastern boundary of D.C. is 76.9094° W, which is -76.9094. The western boundary is 77.1197° W, which is -77.1197.

 So the longitude must be between -77.1197 and -76.9094.

 Our longitude is -77.0163, which is between -77.1197 and -76.9094? 

 Let's break down:

 -77.1197 < -77.0163 < -76.9094? 

 Actually, -77.0163 is greater than -77.1197 (because -77.0163 is closer to zero) and less than -76.9094? 

 But wait: -77.0163 is actually less than -76.9094? Because -77.0163 is more negative? 

 Let me compare:

 -77.0163 and -76.9094: 
   -77.0163 = -77.0163
   -76.9094 = -76.9094

 Since -77.0163 is more negative (i.e., it's a smaller number), then:

   -77.0163 < -76.9094

 But the boundaries are from -77.1197 (westernmost) to -76.9094 (easternmost). So the longitude must be in the range:

   -77.1197 <= longitude <= -76.9094

 And -77.0163 is between these two? 

   -77.1197 <= -77.0163? -> yes, because -77.0163 is greater than -77.1197 (since -77.0163 is to the right on the number line).
   -77.0163 <= -76.9094? -> no, because -77.0163 is less than -76.9094 (since it's more negative).

 Wait, that would mean it's outside the eastern boundary? That can't be.

 Actually, let me think: the western boundary is the most western point, so it has the most negative longitude (because it's the farthest west). The eastern boundary is the least negative (or more positive) because it's to the east.

 So the longitude values in D.C. range from -77.1197 (at the westernmost point) to -76.9094 (at the easternmost point). 

 Our point: -77.0163 is between -77.1197 and -76.9094? 

 Let me write:

   -77.1197 < -77.0163 < -76.9094   ????

 But note: -77.0163 is less than -76.9094? Actually, no:

   -77.0163 is about 77.0163 west, and -76.9094 is about 76.9094 west. So 77.0163 is more than 76.9094? That means 77.0163 is further west than 76.9094? 

 Wait, the longitude values: the more negative the number, the further west. So:

   -77.0163 is more negative than -76.9094, so it is west of -76.9094.

 But the eastern boundary is -76.9094. So anything more negative than that is west of the eastern boundary. So it is within the western part of the district? 

 Actually, the entire district has longitudes from -77.1197 to -76.9094. And -77.0163 is between these two? 

   -77.1197 = -77.1197
   -77.0163 is greater than -77.1197? Yes, because -77.0163 is closer to zero.

   -77.0163 is less than -76.9094? Because -77.0163 is more negative? 

   But wait: -77.0163 is -77.0163, and -76.9094 is -76.9094. 

   We can compare: 
        -77.0163 and -76.9094: 
        Since -77.0163 < -76.9094 (because -77.0163 is more negative) then it is within the range? 

   Actually, the range is from -77.1197 (which is the smallest, most negative) to -76.9094 (which is the largest, least negative). 

   So the condition is: 
        -77.1197 <= longitude <= -76.9094

   Now, -77.0163 is between -77.1197 and -76.9094? 

        -77.1197 <= -77.0163?  -> yes, because -77.0163 is greater than (or less negative than) -77.1197.
        -77.0163 <= -76.9094?  -> no, because -77.0163 is more negative than -76.9094? 

   Wait, no: -77.0163 is less than -76.9094? 

        -77.0163 < -76.9094   -> true

   So it is less than the eastern boundary? That would put it west of the eastern boundary? But note: the condition for being in the district is that the longitude must be greater than or equal to the western boundary and less than or equal to the eastern boundary? 

   Actually, the eastern boundary is the least negative (or the largest in numerical value). So:

        -77.0163 is less than -76.9094? -> yes, but we require it to be less than or equal to the eastern boundary? 

   But wait: the eastern boundary is -76.9094, which is a larger number (less negative). So the condition should be:

        longitude >= -77.1197   and   longitude <= -76.9094

   Now, is -77.0163 <= -76.9094? 

        Yes, because -77.0163 is less than -76.9094? 

   But that's not the case. Actually, we have:

        -77.0163 = -77.0163
        -76.9094 = -76.9094

        Since -77.0163 is less than -76.9094? That is true? 

   But note: in terms of the number line:

        ... -77.1197 ... -77.0163 ... -76.9094 ... 0

        So -77.0163 is between -77.1197 and -76.9094? 

        Yes, because -77.1197 < -77.0163 < -76.9094 is false? Actually, it should be:

        -77.1197 < -77.0163 < -76.9094   -> is this true?

        Let me compare:

          -77.0163 is greater than -77.1197? -> yes, because -77.0163 is to the right of -77.1197.
          -77.0163 is less than -76.9094? -> yes, because -77.0163 is to the left of -76.9094.

        So it is in between? 

        Actually, no: 

          On the number line:

          -77.1197, then -77.0163, then ... and then -76.9094? 

          But wait: -77.0163 is about 77.0163 west, and -76.9094 is 76.9094 west. So 77.0163 is more than 76.9094? That means it is further west? 

          Therefore, the order on the number line (from west to east) would be:

          -77.1197 (most west) ... then -77.0163 ... then -76.9094 (most east).

          So -77.0163 is between -77.1197 and -76.9094? 

          Yes: because -77.0163 is greater than -77.1197 and less than -76.9094? 

          But note: -77.0163 is less than -76.9094? Actually, no:

          -77.0163 is more negative than -76.9094, so it is less than -76.9094? 

          Actually, in mathematics, if a number is more negative, it is smaller. So:

          -77.0163 < -76.9094

          And we want to know if it is less than or equal to the eastern boundary? 

          The eastern boundary is the largest longitude value in the district, which is -76.9094. So we require:

          longitude <= -76.9094   ????

          But that would include longitudes that are more negative than -76.9094? That's the entire district? 

          Actually, the district extends from the western boundary (the most negative) to the eastern boundary (the least negative). So:

          The condition is: longitude should be >= -77.1197 and <= -76.9094.

          And -77.0163 is indeed:

             -77.0163 >= -77.1197 -> true
             -77.0163 <= -76.9094 -> true? 

          But wait: -77.0163 is less than -76.9094? That is true? Then why would it be <=? 

          Actually, the condition is:

             -77.1197 <= longitude <= -76.9094

          This means:

             longitude must be at least -77.1197 (so no more west than that) and at most -76.9094 (so no more east than that). 

          But note: -77.0163 is less than -76.9094? So it is within the range? 

          Actually, let's re-think the inequality:

             -77.1197 <= longitude   and   longitude <= -76.9094

          For our point: 

             -77.1197 <= -77.0163   -> true
             -77.0163 <= -76.9094   -> true

          So it is within the boundaries.

          Therefore, the point (38.9047, -77.0163) is within the District of Columbia.

          So the answer is the District of Columbia.

 Final answer:

District of Columbia
