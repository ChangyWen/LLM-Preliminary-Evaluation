*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 40.5834 and longitude -74.1496.
 In the United States, latitude is positive for north and longitude is negative for west.
 These coordinates are in the northern hemisphere (positive latitude) and western hemisphere (negative longitude).

 We can use a reverse geocoding service or a known database to determine the state.
 However, since we are to provide the answer, we can recall that these coordinates are near New York City.

 Let me check:
 - Latitude 40.5834 is around 40.58 degrees north.
 - Longitude -74.1496 is around 74.15 degrees west.

 This is actually the location of the Staten Island Mall in Staten Island, New York.

 Therefore, the state is New York.

 But let's verify with a known landmark or by checking the coordinates:
 - Staten Island is part of New York City, which is in the state of New York.

 Alternatively, we can note that:
 - New York City coordinates: 
   - Staten Island: approximately 40.5834° N, 74.1496° W.

 So the state is New York.

 Final answer: New York
