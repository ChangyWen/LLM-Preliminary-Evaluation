*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 35.1087 and longitude -89.9663.
 Latitude 35.1087 is in the northern hemisphere (positive) and longitude -89.9663 is in the western hemisphere (negative).
 We are to determine the state in the United States that contains this location.

 Steps:
 1. Recognize that the coordinates are within the continental United States.
 2. We know that the state of Tennessee is located around the 35th parallel and the 90th meridian west.

 However, to be precise, we can use known geographic knowledge or a reverse geocoding service. But since the problem is straightforward, we can rely on common knowledge:

 - The latitude 35.1087 is just above 35 degrees north, which is the approximate boundary between Mississippi and Tennessee (with Tennessee being north of 35°N in the western part).
 - The longitude -89.9663 is about 90 degrees west. The city of Memphis, Tennessee is located at approximately 35.1495° N, 90.0489° W.

 Therefore, the coordinates (35.1087, -89.9663) are very close to Memphis, which is in the state of Tennessee.

 Alternatively, we can note:
   - The northern border of Mississippi is at 35°N (approximately). So a point at 35.1087 is about 0.1087 degrees north of 35°N. Since 1 degree is about 69 miles, that's about 7.5 miles north of the 35th parallel. This puts it in Tennessee.

 Conclusion: The location is in Tennessee.

 Final Answer:
 Tennessee
