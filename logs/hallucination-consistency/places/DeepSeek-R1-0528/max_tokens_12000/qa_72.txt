*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 38.8674 and longitude -104.7605.
 Latitude 38.8674 is positive, meaning it's in the Northern Hemisphere.
 Longitude -104.7605 is negative, meaning it's in the Western Hemisphere.

 We are in the United States because the longitude is between -125 to -65 and latitude between 25 to 50 approximately.

 We can use reverse geocoding to find the state. However, without an API, we rely on known landmarks or approximate coordinates.

 Alternatively, we can recall that:
 - Colorado is roughly between 37°N to 41°N and 102°W to 109°W.

 Let's check:
   Latitude 38.8674 is between 37 and 41.
   Longitude -104.7605 is between -102 and -109? Actually, note that -104.7605 is within the range of 102°W to 109°W (but note that 102°W is -102 and 109°W is -109, so -104.7605 is between -109 and -102? Actually, -104.7605 is between -102 and -109? Let's see: 
   -102 is greater than -104.7605? Actually, -102 is to the east of -104.7605. But in terms of numerical value, we are looking for a longitude that is between -109 and -102. So -104.7605 is within that.

 Therefore, it is likely in Colorado.

 However, let's double-check with a known landmark. The coordinates 38.8674° N, 104.7605° W are actually the coordinates for the United States Air Force Academy, which is located in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

 Therefore, the state is Colorado.

 Final answer:
 Colorado
