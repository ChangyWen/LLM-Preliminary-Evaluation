*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given the latitude 36.1283 and longitude -95.9042.
 We know that in the United States, latitude and longitude can be used to determine the state.
 The coordinates (36.1283, -95.9042) are in the Northern and Western hemispheres (positive latitude means north of the equator, negative longitude means west of the prime meridian).

 We can use reverse geocoding to find the state. However, without an API, we can rely on known geographic knowledge or approximate boundaries.

 Alternatively, we can recall that the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma is around 36°N latitude and 95°W longitude. Specifically, the coordinates 36.1283, -95.9042 are very close to Tulsa, which is in the state of Oklahoma.

 Let's verify by checking the approximate boundaries of Oklahoma:
 - Oklahoma's latitude ranges from about 33.6°N to 37°N.
 - Oklahoma's longitude ranges from about 94.4°W to 103°W.

 The given point (36.1283, -95.9042) falls within these boundaries.

 Therefore, the place is in Oklahoma.

 Final answer:
Oklahoma
