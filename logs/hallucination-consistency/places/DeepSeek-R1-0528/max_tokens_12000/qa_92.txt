*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 40.2752 and longitude -76.8843.
 Latitude is positive, which in the context of the United States usually means north of the equator.
 Longitude is negative, which usually means west of the prime meridian.

 We are in the United States. We need to determine the state.

 We can use reverse geocoding. However, without an API, we can rely on known geographic data.

 Known cities and their coordinates:
 - Harrisburg, PA: approximately 40.2732째 N, 76.8867째 W (very close to the given coordinates)

 Therefore, the coordinates (40.2752, -76.8843) are very near Harrisburg, which is the capital of Pennsylvania.

 Alternatively, we can note that the coordinates are in the vicinity of:
   - Latitude 40.27째 N and Longitude 76.88째 W

 Checking a map, this area is in Pennsylvania.

 Let's confirm with another method: the coordinates are within the boundaries of Pennsylvania.

 So, the state is Pennsylvania.

 Final answer:
