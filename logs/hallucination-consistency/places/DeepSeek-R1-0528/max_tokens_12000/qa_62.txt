*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude and longitude: 27.3387° N, 82.5432° W.
 This coordinate is in the United States because the longitude is negative (west of the prime meridian) and the latitude is around 27° N, which is typical for the southern United States.
 Specifically, we can recall that the state of Florida is located in the southeastern part of the US and has latitudes ranging from about 24° N to 31° N and longitudes from about 80° W to 87° W.
 Let's check the city of Sarasota, Florida, which is around 27.3364° N, 82.5307° W. This is very close to the given coordinates (27.3387, -82.5432). Therefore, the location is in Florida.
 Hence, the state is Florida.
