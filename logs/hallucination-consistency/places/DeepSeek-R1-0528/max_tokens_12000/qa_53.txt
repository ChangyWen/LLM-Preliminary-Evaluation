*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given the coordinates: latitude 30.0687 and longitude -89.9288.
 These coordinates are in decimal degrees. The positive latitude indicates north of the equator, and the negative longitude indicates west of the prime meridian.

 The United States uses the WGS84 coordinate system for GPS. We can determine the state by recognizing that the coordinates are in the vicinity of the Gulf Coast.

 Let's break down:
 - Latitude 30.0687 N: This is just above 30 degrees north, which is a common latitude in the southern United States.
 - Longitude -89.9288 W: This is approximately 90 degrees west, which is also common in the central part of the country.

 We can recall that the city of New Orleans, Louisiana is around 29.95° N, 90.07° W. The given longitude is about 89.93° W, which is slightly east of 90° W.

 Therefore, we can infer that the location is in the state of Louisiana, near the city of Slidell or perhaps the eastern part of the New Orleans metropolitan area.

 To confirm, we can note:
 - The coordinates 30.0687, -89.9288 are very close to the city of Slidell, Louisiana, which is in St. Tammany Parish.

 Alternatively, we can use a reverse geocoding service or a known database, but since we are to reason step by step, we rely on geographic knowledge.

 However, let's double-check with adjacent states:
 - Mississippi: The southern part of Mississippi is above 30° N? Actually, the southern border of Mississippi with Louisiana is around 30.2° N at the coast? But note that the coordinates are 30.0687, which is below 30.2° N. Also, the longitude of the Mississippi coast is around 88-89° W? The given longitude is -89.9288, which is about 89.93° W. The Mississippi coast (like Biloxi) is around 88-89° W, but the westernmost part of Mississippi is at about 91° W? Actually, the longitude of the Mississippi/Louisiana border is around 89.7° W to 89.8° W? 

 We can look up the boundaries:
 - The state of Louisiana is to the west of the Pearl River, which forms part of the border with Mississippi. The longitude of the Pearl River at its mouth is about 89.5° W? But the given longitude is 89.93° W, which is west of 89.5° W? Actually, 89.93° W is more than 89.5° W? Wait: negative numbers: -89.93 is more negative than -89.5, meaning it is farther west? Actually, no: -89.93 is less than -89.5? Because -89.93 is to the left of -89.5 on the number line. So -89.93° is actually west of -89.5°.

 However, the border between Louisiana and Mississippi along the Pearl River is approximately at 89.75° W at the coast? But the exact boundary is the center of the river. The coordinates given (30.0687, -89.9288) would be on the western side of the Pearl River? Therefore, it should be in Louisiana.

 Alternatively, we can note that the city of Slidell, Louisiana has coordinates approximately 30.275° N, 89.781° W. But our point is at 30.0687, -89.9288. That's a bit south of Slidell. However, the area around Lake Pontchartrain and the Rigolets is at about 30.1° N and 89.9° W. This is still within Louisiana.

 Therefore, we conclude the state is Louisiana.

 Final answer: Louisiana
