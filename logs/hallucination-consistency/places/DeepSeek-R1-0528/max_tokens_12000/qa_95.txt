*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given the latitude 39.5497 and longitude -119.8483.
 We know that in the United States, negative longitude indicates west of the Prime Meridian, and positive latitude indicates north of the equator.
 We are looking for the state in the USA that contains this point.

 Steps:
 1. We can recall that the state of Nevada is located in the western United States and its major cities include Reno and Las Vegas.
 2. The coordinates 39.5497 N and 119.8483 W are in the vicinity of Reno, Nevada.
 3. To confirm, we can note that Reno's coordinates are approximately 39.5296° N, 119.8138° W. The given coordinates are very close to that.

 Alternatively, we can use our knowledge of U.S. geography:
 - The latitude 39.5° N is in the northern hemisphere and in the U.S., it runs through states like California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, etc.
 - The longitude -119.8° W is in the western part of the U.S., specifically in the Pacific Time Zone.

 Given that the point is at 39.5° N and 119.8° W, we can eliminate:
   - California: because California's eastern border with Nevada is at approximately 120° W. But note that the given longitude is -119.8483, which is about 119.8483° W. The California-Nevada border is at 120° W? Actually, the border is along 120° W for a part, but the area around Lake Tahoe is a bit complex. However, Reno is just east of the California border and the longitude 119.8483° W is clearly east of 120° W? Actually, 119.8483 is west of 120°? Wait: -119.8483 is 119.8483° W. Since 120° W is further west than 119.8483° W? Actually, no: 120° W is a larger number in the west (more negative in decimal if we think of negative as west). But note: -120° is more negative than -119.8483. So -119.8483 is actually east of -120°. Therefore, it would be in Nevada because the California-Nevada border is at 120° W? Actually, the border is along 120° W for the northern part? But let's check a map.

 However, we can recall that Reno, Nevada is at about 119.8° W. So the given point is in Nevada.

 Therefore, the state is Nevada.

 Final answer: Nevada
