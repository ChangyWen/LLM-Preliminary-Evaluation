*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 43.0642 and longitude -87.9675.
 We know that the United States uses the WGS84 coordinate system for GPS.
 The coordinates (43.0642, -87.9675) are in the northern and western hemispheres (positive latitude for north, negative longitude for west).
 We can identify the state by known landmarks or by using a reverse geocoding service, but since we are to do this without external tools, we rely on knowledge of major cities.

 Notice that the coordinates are very close to the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
 Specifically, the coordinates (43.0642, -87.9675) are in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

 Therefore, the state is Wisconsin.

 Final answer:
