*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 41.823 and longitude -71.4187.
 We need to determine the U.S. state where this point is located.

 Steps:
 1. We note that in the United States, latitudes are positive for the northern hemisphere and longitudes are negative for the western hemisphere (so this is in the USA).
 2. We can use reverse geocoding to find the state. However, without an API, we can rely on known boundaries or approximate regions.

 Known facts:
 - The latitude 41.823 is about 41.8 degrees north, which is in the northern part of the United States.
 - The longitude -71.4187 is about 71.4 degrees west, which is on the east coast.

 We can recall that:
 - The state of Rhode Island is located in the New England region and has latitudes approximately between 41.18°N and 42.02°N and longitudes between about -71.8°W and -71.1°W.

 Let's compare:
   Latitude: 41.823 is between 41.18 and 42.02 -> within Rhode Island's latitude range.
   Longitude: -71.4187 is between -71.8 and -71.1 -> within Rhode Island's longitude range.

 Therefore, the point is in Rhode Island.

 However, let's double-check with nearby states:
   - Massachusetts: extends to about 41.2°N to 42.9°N and -73.5°W to -69.9°W. But the longitude -71.4187 is within the range of Rhode Island and also the southern coast of Massachusetts? However, note that the point is at 41.823N which is near the southern border of Massachusetts? Actually, the southern border of Massachusetts is at 41.2°N to 42.0°N? And the longitude -71.4187 is near the Rhode Island border.

 But note: the famous city of Providence, RI is at approximately 41.82°N, 71.41°W. This point is very close to that.

 Therefore, we can be confident that the point is in Rhode Island.

 Final answer: Rhode Island

 We output the state abbreviation as requested? But the question asks for the state. We'll write the full state name.

 However, note: the problem says "state", so we write the state name.

 But to be precise, let's note that the point is in the state of Rhode Island.

 Answer: Rhode Island
