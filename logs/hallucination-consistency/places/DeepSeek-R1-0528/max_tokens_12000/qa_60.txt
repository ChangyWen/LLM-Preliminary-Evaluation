*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 35.1054 and longitude -106.6465.
 To determine the state, we note that the coordinates are within the United States because the longitude is negative (west of the prime meridian) and the latitude is positive (north of the equator).
 Specifically, we can recognize that these coordinates are in the southwestern United States.

 After cross-referencing with known cities or using a geolocation service, we know that these coordinates correspond to Albuquerque, New Mexico.

 Therefore, the state is New Mexico.

 However, let's double-check by considering:
   - Latitude 35.1054 is about 35 degrees north.
   - Longitude -106.6465 is about 106.65 degrees west.

 The city of Albuquerque is located in the state of New Mexico, USA.

 Final answer: New Mexico
