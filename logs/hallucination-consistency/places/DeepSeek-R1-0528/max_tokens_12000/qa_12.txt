*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude and longitude: 42.3834° N, 83.1024° W.
 We need to determine the state in the United States that this location is in.
 Steps:
 1. Recognize that the coordinates are in the northern and western hemispheres (positive latitude for north, negative longitude for west).
 2. We can use a reverse geocoding service or know that this is in the United States. However, without an API, we rely on known facts.
 3. We note that the latitude 42.3834° N is in the northern part of the United States and the longitude 83.1024° W is in the eastern part of the country but still in the Midwest.
 4. Known major cities: Detroit, Michigan is around 42.3314° N, 83.0458° W. These coordinates are very close to Detroit.
 5. Therefore, the state is Michigan.

 Let's confirm with nearby landmarks:
   - The coordinates (42.3834, -83.1024) are approximately in the city of Detroit, Michigan.
   - Alternatively, we can note that the latitude 42.3834 is just north of the center of Detroit (which is about 42.33).

 Conclusion: The state is Michigan.

 Final answer:
Michigan
