*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 47.6671 and longitude -117.433.
 We know that the state we are looking for is in the United States because the longitude is negative (which indicates the Western Hemisphere) and the latitude is around 47.6 (which is within the continental US, specifically in the northern part).

 We can recall that the state of Washington is located in the Pacific Northwest and has a city called Spokane at approximately these coordinates.

 Let me verify:
 - Spokane, WA has coordinates approximately 47.6588째 N, 117.4250째 W. That is very close to the given coordinates (47.6671, -117.433).

 Therefore, the place is in the state of Washington.

 Final answer:
 Washington
