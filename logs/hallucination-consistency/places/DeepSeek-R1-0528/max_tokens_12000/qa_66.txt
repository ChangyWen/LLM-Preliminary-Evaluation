We are given the coordinates: latitude 39.7805 and longitude -84.2003.
 Latitude is positive, so it's in the Northern Hemisphere.
 Longitude is negative, so it's in the Western Hemisphere.

 We are trying to find the state in the United States that contains this point.

 We can recall that the state of Ohio is around 40 degrees north and 82-84 degrees west? But let's check more precisely.

 However, note that the longitude given is -84.2003, which is around 84.2 degrees west. This is within the typical range for Ohio, but let's be more precise.

 We can use known cities as reference:
 - Dayton, Ohio has coordinates around 39.7589째 N, 84.1916째 W.

 The given coordinates (39.7805, -84.2003) are very close to Dayton, Ohio.

 Therefore, the place is in the state of Ohio.
