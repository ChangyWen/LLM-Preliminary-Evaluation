*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 35.9692 and longitude -83.9496.
 First, note that in the United States, negative longitude typically indicates west of the prime meridian, so this is in the western hemisphere (in the US, that means west of the prime meridian and east of the international date line).
 The latitude 35.9692 is positive, meaning it is north of the equator.

 We need to determine the state in the USA that contains these coordinates.

 Steps:
 1. Recall that the United States is divided into states, each with defined boundaries.
 2. We can use our knowledge of approximate state boundaries or known landmarks to make an educated guess.

 Known landmarks:
 - The coordinates are near the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, and also near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

 Let's cross-check with known cities:
 - Knoxville, Tennessee has coordinates approximately: latitude 35.9606, longitude -83.9207.
 - Our given coordinates: latitude 35.9692, longitude -83.9496.

 Comparing:
   Latitude: 35.9692 vs Knoxville's 35.9606 -> very close, about 0.0086 degrees north (which is about 0.95 km north).
   Longitude: -83.9496 vs Knoxville's -83.9207 -> about 0.0289 degrees west (which is about 2.5 km west).

 Since Knoxville is in Tennessee, and the coordinates are very close to Knoxville, it is likely in Tennessee.

 However, let's also consider the state boundaries. The boundary between Tennessee and North Carolina runs through the Great Smoky Mountains. The longitude -83.9496 is west of the prime meridian and the state line in that area is approximately at 83.65°W? Actually, the boundary is not a straight line of longitude but a complex topographic boundary. However, the city of Knoxville is well within Tennessee.

 Alternatively, we can note that the city of Gatlinburg, Tennessee is near the park and has coordinates around 35.7148° N, 83.5110° W. Our point is at 35.9692, which is north of Gatlinburg, and the longitude -83.9496 is west of Gatlinburg.

 Another known point: the city of Maryville, Tennessee is at approximately 35.7565° N, 83.9704° W. Our point is at 35.9692 (north of Maryville) and -83.9496 (east of Maryville by about 0.0208 degrees, which is about 1.8 km). So it is in the vicinity.

 However, let's check the exact boundaries. We must note that the state line between Tennessee and North Carolina is at the crest of the Smokies. The longitude of the state line in that area is typically to the east of -83.9496? Actually, the state line runs along the peaks of the Smokies, which are to the east of our point. Therefore, our point (longitude -83.9496) is west of the state line and thus in Tennessee.

 We can also use a known landmark: the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The park spans both states, but the coordinates we have are:

   Latitude: 35.9692
   Longitude: -83.9496

 Let's check with the park boundaries. The park's boundaries are complex, but the western boundary of the park (and thus the state boundary) is generally to the east of -83.9496? Actually, the park extends west to about -83.95? But note that the park's western boundary is not the state line. The state line is within the park and runs along the crest. The western part of the park is still in Tennessee.

 However, let's look at the exact location: 
   The coordinates 35.9692, -83.9496 are very close to Knoxville, which is in Tennessee.

 We can also check with a reverse geocoding service in mind, but since we are to answer without external tools, we rely on known facts.

 Conclusion: The coordinates are in Tennessee.

 Therefore, the state is Tennessee.

 Final answer:
