*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 33.9381 and longitude -117.3949.
 First, note that in the United States, latitudes are positive for north and longitudes are negative for west.
 So, 33.9381 N, 117.3949 W.

 We need to find the state in the USA that contains this point.

 We can use reverse geocoding, but since the problem is about US states, we can use known boundaries or a geocoding service.
 However, without an external service, we rely on known facts:

 - The coordinates (33.9381, -117.3949) are in the vicinity of Riverside, California.

 Let me verify with known landmarks:
   The March Air Reserve Base is near Riverside, CA, and its coordinates are approximately 33.9째N, 117.3째W.

 Therefore, the state is California.

 Final answer:
 California
