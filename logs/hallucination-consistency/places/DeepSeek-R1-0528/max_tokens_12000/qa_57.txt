We are given the coordinates: latitude 26.2252 and longitude -98.2467.
 We need to determine the state in which this location is situated.

 Steps:
 1. Recognize that the latitude is positive and in the northern hemisphere (26.2252° N).
 2. The longitude is negative, so it is in the western hemisphere (-98.2467° W).

 3. We know that the location is in the United States because the coordinates are within the continental US range.
    - Latitude: approximately 24°N to 49°N
    - Longitude: approximately 67°W to 125°W

 4. We can use our knowledge of US geography: the coordinates are in the southern part of the United States, near the border with Mexico.

 5. Specifically, the longitude -98.2467° W is in the central part of the southern border. The latitude 26.2252° N is near the southern tip of Texas.

 6. Let's cross-reference with known cities:
    - The city of McAllen, Texas, is located at approximately 26.2034° N, 98.2300° W (note: the given longitude is negative, so -98.2300° W).
    - Our point (26.2252, -98.2467) is very close to McAllen, which is in the state of Texas.

 7. Therefore, we can confidently say that the location is in Texas.

Final Answer:
