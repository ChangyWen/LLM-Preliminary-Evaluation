We are given the coordinates: latitude 40.7498 and longitude -73.7976.
 Latitude 40.7498 is positive, which indicates it is in the Northern Hemisphere.
 Longitude -73.7976 is negative, which indicates it is in the Western Hemisphere.

 We are trying to determine the state in the United States that contains this location.

 We know that the United States uses the geographic coordinate system with latitude and longitude. 
 The given coordinates are in the range of the contiguous United States.

 We can recall that New York City is around 40.7° N, 74.0° W. Let's compare:
   - New York City: approximately 40.7128° N, 74.0060° W.

 The given point (40.7498° N, -73.7976° W) is very close to New York City. 
 Specifically, the longitude -73.7976° W is about 0.2084 degrees east of 74.0° W (since 74.0 - 73.7976 = 0.2024, but note that the negative sign means west, so a smaller absolute value of longitude is actually more east). 
 Also, the latitude 40.7498° is just a bit north of 40.7128°.

 Therefore, we can deduce that this location is in the state of New York.

 To be more precise, we can note that the coordinates are very close to the borough of Queens in New York City. 
 For example, the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center (home of the US Open) in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, has coordinates approximately 40.7500° N, 73.797° W. 
 This matches almost exactly.

 Therefore, the state is New York.

 Final Answer: New York
