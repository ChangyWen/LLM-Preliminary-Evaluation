*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude and longitude: 41.3113 (North), -72.9246 (West)
 We need to determine the U.S. state where this point is located.

 Steps:
 1. Recognize that the coordinates are within the United States because the longitude is negative (West) and the latitude is around 41°N.
 2. We can use reverse geocoding to find the state. However, without an API, we rely on known geographic knowledge or a database.

 Known geographic facts:
 - The coordinates (41.3113° N, 72.9246° W) are in the Northeastern United States.
 - Major cities in this region include New York, Boston, etc.

 Let's compare with known cities:
   - New York City: approx. 40.7° N, 74.0° W
   - New Haven, CT: approx. 41.31° N, 72.92° W

 The coordinates (41.3113, -72.9246) are very close to New Haven, Connecticut.

 Therefore, the state is Connecticut.

 Final Answer:
 Connecticut
