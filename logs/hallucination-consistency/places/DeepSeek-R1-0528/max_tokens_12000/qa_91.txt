*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 41.6638 and longitude -83.5827.
 We know that in the United States, latitude is positive for north and longitude is negative for west.
 So, this point is at approximately 41.66° N, 83.58° W.

 We need to determine the state in the USA that contains this coordinate.

 Steps:
 1. Recall that the state of Michigan is known for its location around the Great Lakes, particularly Lake Erie.
 2. The coordinates are near the city of Toledo, which is in Ohio, but note that the border between Ohio and Michigan in that area is very close.

 However, let's be precise:

 - The city of Toledo, Ohio, is at approximately 41.6639° N, 83.5822° W. 
   This is extremely close to the given coordinates.

 But wait, there is a historical dispute (the Toledo War) that resulted in the current border. The current border is set at approximately 41°44' N (which is about 41.7333° N) for the northern border of Ohio. However, the given latitude is 41.6638, which is less than 41.7333. Therefore, it should be in Ohio?

 Let me double-check:

 The northern border of Ohio is defined as a line at 41°42' N (or 41.7° N) for the majority of the border? Actually, the Toledo area border is complex.

 Alternatively, we can note that the city of Toledo is in Ohio, and the given coordinates are within the city limits of Toledo.

 Therefore, the state is Ohio.

 However, let's verify with a known landmark:

 The coordinates 41.6638, -83.5827 are for the Toledo Zoo, which is located in Toledo, Ohio.

 Therefore, the state is Ohio.

 Final answer: Ohio

**************************************** Content ***************************************
The coordinates 41.6638° N, -83.5827° W correspond to Toledo, Ohio. This location is within the city limits of Toledo and falls under the state of Ohio. The latitude and longitude place it squarely in the Midwestern United States, near the border with Michigan but definitively in Ohio.

Ohio
