We are given latitude 32.8168 and longitude -79.9687.
 Latitude 32.8168 is positive, so it's in the Northern Hemisphere.
 Longitude -79.9687 is negative, so it's in the Western Hemisphere.

 We are in the United States because the coordinates are within the contiguous US range.

 We can use a reverse geocoding service or known landmarks to determine the state.

 However, without using an API, we can recall that these coordinates are near the city of Charleston, South Carolina.

 Let me verify by known landmarks:
 - Charleston, SC is approximately at 32.7833° N, 79.9333° W. The given longitude is -79.9687, which is very close.

 Therefore, the coordinates (32.8168, -79.9687) are in the state of South Carolina.
