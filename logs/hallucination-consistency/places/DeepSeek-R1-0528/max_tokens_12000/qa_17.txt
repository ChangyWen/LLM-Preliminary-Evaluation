*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 40.6501 and longitude -73.9496.
 Latitude: positive, so north. Longitude: negative, so west.
 This coordinate is in the United States (since the longitude is west and latitude is around 40, which is typical for the northeastern US).

 We can recall that New York City is around 40.7째 N and 74.0째 W. This coordinate is very close to that.

 Let me check the exact location:
 - Latitude 40.6501 is about 40.65째 N.
 - Longitude -73.9496 is about 73.95째 W.

 This is very close to the coordinates of Brooklyn, New York. Specifically, Prospect Park in Brooklyn is around these coordinates.

 Therefore, the state is New York.

 Final Answer:
 New York
