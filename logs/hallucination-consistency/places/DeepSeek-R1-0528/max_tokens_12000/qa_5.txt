*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 32.7935 and longitude -96.7667.
 We know that in the United States, these coordinates are likely in the contiguous 48 states.
 The negative longitude indicates it is west of the prime meridian.

 We can recall that the city of Dallas, Texas, is around these coordinates.
 Let me verify: 
   Dallas, TX, has coordinates approximately 32.7767째 N, 96.7970째 W (which is about 32.7767, -96.7970).
 The given coordinates (32.7935, -96.7667) are very close to that.

 Alternatively, we can use reverse geocoding or known state boundaries, but since this is a common location, we can conclude it is in Texas.

 However, to be precise, let's note:
   Latitude: 32.7935째 N
   Longitude: 96.7667째 W

 The coordinates fall within the state of Texas.

 Therefore, the state is Texas.

 Final answer:
 Texas
