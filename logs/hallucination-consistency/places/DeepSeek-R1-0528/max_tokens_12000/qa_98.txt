*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given the latitude 34.8354 and longitude -82.3646.
 We know that negative longitude typically indicates the western hemisphere, and in the context of the United States, it would be west of the prime meridian.
 The coordinates correspond to a location in the United States because the latitude is around 34-35 degrees north and longitude around 82 degrees west.

 We can recall that the state of South Carolina is located in the southeastern United States and has a latitude range of about 32° to 35°N and a longitude range of about 78.5° to 83.0°W.

 Let's check:
   Latitude: 34.8354 is within the range of South Carolina (which goes up to about 35.2°N at the northernmost point).
   Longitude: -82.3646 (which is 82.3646°W) is within the range of South Carolina (which extends from about 78.5°W to 83.0°W).

 Additionally, we can note that the city of Greenville, South Carolina is located at approximately 34.85°N, 82.40°W. Our coordinates are very close to that.

 Therefore, the location is in South Carolina.

 Final answer:
South Carolina
