*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 37.9722 and longitude -122.0016.
 Latitude is positive, which in the US typically means north of the equator.
 Longitude is negative, which typically means west of the prime meridian.

 We are in the United States because the coordinates are within the continental US range (roughly between 24 and 49 degrees north, and -125 to -67 degrees west).

 We can use a reverse geocoding service or a known database to determine the state. However, without an API, we can use known landmarks or approximate boundaries.

 Alternatively, we can recall that the coordinates are near the San Francisco Bay Area. Let's check:

 - San Francisco is at approximately 37.7749° N, 122.4194° W.

 The given coordinates (37.9722, -122.0016) are north of San Francisco. 

 We can look at cities in the area:
   - Richmond, CA: approximately 37.9358° N, 122.3478° W (but our longitude is more east, meaning less west? -122.0016 is east of -122.3478 because -122.0016 is closer to zero).
   - Berkeley, CA: approximately 37.8715° N, 122.2730° W.

 Alternatively, we can note that the coordinates are near the city of Richmond and the San Pablo Bay.

 After cross-referencing with a map or known boundaries, we can determine that:

   Latitude 37.9722 and longitude -122.0016 is in the city of Richmond, which is in the state of California.

 However, to be precise, we can also note that the coordinates are very close to the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge (which connects Richmond to San Rafael). The bridge is in California.

 Therefore, the state is California.

 Final Answer:
California
