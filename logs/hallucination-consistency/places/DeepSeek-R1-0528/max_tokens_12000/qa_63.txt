*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given the coordinates: latitude 36.783 and longitude -119.7939.
 Latitude 36.783 is north of the equator (positive) and longitude -119.7939 is west (negative in the western hemisphere).

 We know that the contiguous United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) lies between approximately:
 - Latitude: 24.396308 (southern tip of Florida) to 49.384358 (northern border with Canada)
 - Longitude: -125.0 (west coast) to -66.93457 (east coast)

 The coordinates (36.783, -119.7939) are within the contiguous US.

 Now, we need to determine the state. We can note the following:

 - The latitude 36.783°N is around the central part of California (which is between about 32.5°N to 42°N).
 - The longitude -119.7939°W is also within California (longitude range approximately -124° to -114°).

 Specifically, we can recall that Fresno, California is located at approximately 36.7833° N, 119.7939° W? Wait, note that the given longitude is negative, meaning it's west of the prime meridian. But in the US, we use west longitudes as negative. However, the given longitude is -119.7939, which is the same as 119.7939° W.

 But note: The city of Fresno, California is known to be at approximately 36.7833° N, 119.7939° W. So the coordinates are very close to Fresno.

 Therefore, we can conclude that the location is in the state of California.

 Final answer: California
