*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 33.5722 and longitude -112.0892.
 Latitude is positive, so it's in the Northern Hemisphere.
 Longitude is negative, so it's in the Western Hemisphere.

 We are to determine the state in the United States that contains these coordinates.

 Steps:
 1. We know that the coordinates are in the US because the longitude is around -112 (which is in the western US) and the latitude is around 33 (which is in the southern part of the US).

 2. We can recall that the state of Arizona is located in the southwestern United States and has a latitude range approximately between 31°20'N and 37°N and a longitude range between approximately 109°03'W and 114°49'W.

 3. Let's check if 33.5722°N falls within the latitude range of Arizona: 31.20°N to 37°N -> yes, 33.5722 is between 31.20 and 37.
 4. Check the longitude: -112.0892°W. The range for Arizona is about 109.03°W to 114.49°W. Note: negative degrees so -109.03 is about 109.03°W and -114.49 is about 114.49°W. Since -112.0892 is between -114.49 and -109.03 (because -112.0892 is greater than -114.49 and less than -109.03), it falls within Arizona.

 5. Therefore, the coordinates (33.5722, -112.0892) are in Arizona.

 However, to be more precise, we can note that the city of Phoenix, Arizona is around 33.5722°N, 112.0892°W. This is a well-known city in Arizona.

 Therefore, the state is Arizona.

 Final answer: Arizona
