*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 37.5295 and longitude -77.4756.
 Latitude: positive 37.5295 indicates Northern Hemisphere.
 Longitude: negative -77.4756 indicates Western Hemisphere (so in the USA).

 We need to find the state in the USA that contains this coordinate.

 Steps:
 1. Recall that in the United States, the states have boundaries. We can use our knowledge of approximate state boundaries or known cities.

 2. Let's think about the coordinates:
    - Latitude 37.5 is around the middle of the United States (the contiguous 48 states) in terms of north-south. For reference:
        - The northern border of the contiguous US is about 49°N (with Canada).
        - The southern tip of Florida is about 25°N.
        - The 37th parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 37 degrees north of the Earth's equatorial plane. It crosses Europe, the Mediterranean Sea, Africa, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America, and the Atlantic Ocean.

    - Longitude -77.5 is in the Eastern part of the US. The prime meridian is 0, and the US is in the west so longitudes are negative. The east coast of the US is around -70 to -80 degrees.

 3. We can recall that the state of Virginia is located in the mid-Atlantic region and has a latitude range approximately between 36.5°N and 39.5°N, and a longitude range between approximately -75° to -83°W.

 4. Let's check a known city in Virginia: Richmond, the capital of Virginia, has coordinates approximately 37.5407° N, 77.4360° W. 
    Our given point: (37.5295, -77.4756) is very close to Richmond, Virginia.

 5. Therefore, we can conclude that the point is in Virginia.

 6. We should note that there are other states near Virginia (like North Carolina to the south, West Virginia to the west, Maryland to the north). But the coordinates are very close to Richmond, VA.

 7. To be thorough, let's consider the boundaries:
    - Virginia's northern border with Maryland and Washington D.C. is around 39°N? Actually, the northern border of Virginia is the Potomac River, and the latitude of the Potomac at its southernmost in Virginia is about 38°N? But note that the given latitude is 37.5°N, which is well within Virginia.

    - The southern border of Virginia with North Carolina is at 36°30'N (the 36.5 parallel). So 37.5°N is above that.

 8. Therefore, the state is Virginia.

 Final Answer: Virginia
