We are given latitude 42.2705 and longitude -71.8079.
 Latitude 42.2705 is in the northern hemisphere (positive) and longitude -71.8079 is in the western hemisphere (negative).
 We are to determine the state in the United States that contains this coordinate.

 The coordinates are within the continental United States. We know that:
 - Massachusetts is known for having a latitude around 42° and longitude around -71° to -73°.

 Specifically, the city of Worcester, Massachusetts has coordinates approximately:
   Latitude: 42.2626° N, Longitude: 71.8023° W

 The given coordinates (42.2705, -71.8079) are very close to Worcester. Therefore, we can infer that the location is in Massachusetts.

 However, to be thorough, let's consider the boundaries of Massachusetts:
 - The state of Massachusetts lies between approximately:
   Latitude: 41.2° N to 42.9° N
