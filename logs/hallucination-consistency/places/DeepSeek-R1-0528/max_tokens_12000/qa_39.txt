*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 36.7335 and longitude -76.0435.
 In the United States, latitude and longitude coordinates are typically in the format where positive latitude is north and negative longitude is west.
 Therefore, these coordinates represent a location at approximately 36.7335° N, 76.0435° W.

 We know that the state of Virginia in the United States includes the city of Norfolk, which is around 36.85° N, 76.29° W. The given coordinates are close to that.

 Let's check the approximate boundaries of Virginia:
 - Virginia's latitude ranges from about 36.5° N to 39.5° N.
 - Virginia's longitude ranges from about -75.2° W to -83.7° W.

 The given longitude -76.0435 is within the range of Virginia's longitudes, and the latitude 36.7335 is also within Virginia's latitude range.

 Moreover, the coordinates (36.7335, -76.0435) are very close to the city of Norfolk, Virginia.

 Therefore, the state is Virginia.

 Final answer:
Virginia
