*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given the coordinates: latitude 36.2333 and longitude -115.2654.
 We know that latitude is positive in the northern hemisphere and negative in the southern. Longitude is positive east of the prime meridian and negative west.
 Since the longitude is negative, it's west of the prime meridian.

 These coordinates are in the United States because:
 - The latitude (36.2333) is within the range of the contiguous US (approximately 24°N to 49°N).
 - The longitude (-115.2654) is within the range of the western US (approximately 67°W to 125°W).

 Specifically, we can recognize that the coordinates are near the city of Las Vegas, which is in the state of Nevada.

 Let me verify by recalling:
 - Las Vegas has coordinates around 36.17° N, 115.14° W. Our point is at 36.2333° N and 115.2654° W, which is very close.

 Therefore, the place is in the state of Nevada.

 Final answer:
 Nevada
