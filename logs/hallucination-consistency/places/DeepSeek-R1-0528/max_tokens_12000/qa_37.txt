*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 39.9862 and longitude -82.9855.
 Latitude 39.9862 is positive, which indicates it's in the Northern Hemisphere.
 Longitude -82.9855 is negative, which indicates it's in the Western Hemisphere.

 We are looking for the state in the United States that contains this coordinate.

 We can recall that the state of Ohio is located in the Midwestern United States and has a latitude range approximately between 38.4 and 42 degrees North, and a longitude range approximately between -80.5 and -84.8 degrees West.

 Let's check if the given coordinates fall within Ohio:
 - Latitude: 39.9862 is between 38.4 and 42 -> within Ohio's latitude.
 - Longitude: -82.9855 is between -84.8 and -80.5 -> within Ohio's longitude.

 Therefore, the place with these coordinates is in Ohio.

 However, to be precise, we can note that the coordinates (39.9862, -82.9855) correspond to a specific location. Using a map, we can verify that these coordinates are in fact in the city of Columbus, Ohio.

 But the question asks for the state. So the answer is Ohio.

 Final answer:
Ohio
