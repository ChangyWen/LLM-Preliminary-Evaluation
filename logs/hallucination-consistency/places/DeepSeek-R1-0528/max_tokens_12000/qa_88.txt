*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 33.4015 and longitude -111.7178.
 We know that in the United States, latitude is positive for north and longitude is negative for west.
 This location is in the northern and western hemisphere.

 We need to identify the state. We can recall that the state of Arizona has a latitude range of approximately 31°20'N to 37°N and longitude of approximately 109°03'W to 114°49'W.

 Let's check:
 Latitude: 33.4015°N is between 31.2°N and 37°N.
 Longitude: -111.7178°W is between -114.49°W and -109.03°W? Note that -111.7178 is about 111.7178° west.

 The longitude range of Arizona is from about 109°03'W (which is -109.05) to 114°49'W (which is -114.8167). 
 Since -111.7178 is between -114.8167 and -109.05, it falls within Arizona.

 Therefore, the state is Arizona.

 Final answer: Arizona
