*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 39.1238 and longitude -94.5541.
 In the United States, negative longitude indicates west of the prime meridian, and positive latitude indicates north of the equator.
 We are looking for the state in the USA that contains this point.

 Steps:
 1. Recognize that the coordinates (39.1238 N, 94.5541 W) are in the United States because the latitude is around 39 degrees north (which is within the continental US) and the longitude is around 94 degrees west (also within the continental US).

 2. We can recall or know that the city of Kansas City is located at approximately 39 degrees north and 94 degrees west. However, we need to be precise.

 3. We can note that the state of Missouri and the state of Kansas are both in this region. The coordinates are very close to the border of these two states.

 4. We can use known geographic boundaries: The Missouri-Kansas state line runs along longitude approximately 94.6 degrees west? Actually, the border between Kansas and Missouri is a straight north-south line at approximately 94.6 degrees west? But let's check the exact coordinates.

 5. Actually, the border between Kansas and Missouri is at 94.6 degrees west? Wait, let me recall: the state line between Kansas and Missouri is at approximately 94 degrees 36 minutes west? That would be 94.6 degrees west? (since 36 minutes is 36/60 = 0.6 degrees).

 6. Given our longitude is -94.5541, which is equivalent to 94.5541 degrees west. How does that compare to 94.6?

    - 94.5541 is less than 94.6, meaning it is east of 94.6 degrees west.

    - Since the state line is at about 94.6 degrees west, then a point at 94.5541 degrees west would be east of the state line.

    - Therefore, it should be in Missouri.

 7. However, let's double-check with a known landmark: Kansas City, Missouri is on the east side of the state line, and Kansas City, Kansas is on the west side.

    - The coordinates for downtown Kansas City, Missouri are approximately 39.0997° N, 94.5783° W.

    - Our point: 39.1238° N, 94.5541° W.

    - Comparing the longitude: 94.5541 is east of 94.5783? Actually, 94.5541 is a smaller number (less west) than 94.5783, so it is east of downtown Kansas City, MO.

    - Therefore, it is still in Missouri.

 8. Alternatively, we can use a known fact: the state line is at approximately 94.6 degrees west. Our point at 94.5541° W is about 0.0459 degrees east of 94.6. Since one degree of longitude at this latitude is about 53 miles (85 km), 0.0459 degrees is about 2.4 miles (0.0459 * 53 ≈ 2.4). So the point is about 2.4 miles east of the state line. Therefore, it is in Missouri.

 9. We must be cautious: the state line is not exactly at 94.6? Actually, the boundary between Kansas and Missouri is the 102nd meridian west? Wait, no, the Kansas-Missouri border is defined as the line from the mouth of the Kansas River (which is at about 94.6 degrees west) and then straight north? Actually, the border is at approximately 94 degrees 36 minutes west? Which is 94.6 degrees.

    - Therefore, our point at 94.5541 is 94 degrees and 0.5541*60 minutes = 33.246 minutes west. So 94°33.246' W.
    - The state line is at 94°36' W. So 33.246 minutes is less than 36 minutes, meaning it is east of the state line.

 10. Thus, the point (39.1238, -94.5541) is in Missouri.

 Final answer: Missouri

 However, let's make sure we are not in Kansas City, Kansas or any other state. The coordinates are also near the Missouri River. There is a part of Kansas City, Missouri that is north of the river. Our latitude is 39.1238, which is north of the river (the river runs around 39.1 degrees north at that point). So it could be in the northern part of Kansas City, MO.

 Conclusion: The state is Missouri.

 Therefore, we output:
 Missouri

The coordinates 39.1238° N, 94.5541° W correspond to a location in Kansas City, specifically in the northern part of the city. This point is east of the Kansas-Missouri state line, which runs along approximately 94.6° W longitude. Since the given longitude (94.5541° W) is east of 94.6° W, the location is within the state of Missouri.

Missouri
