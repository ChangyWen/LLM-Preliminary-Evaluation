We are given latitude 41.0798 (North) and longitude -81.5219 (West).
 This location is in the United States because the longitude is negative (West) and the latitude is around 41 degrees North.

 We know that the state of Ohio is around these coordinates. Specifically, the city of Akron, Ohio is near these coordinates.

 Let's verify by recalling:
 - The approximate latitude of Ohio: between 38.4 and 41.9 degrees North.
 - The approximate longitude of Ohio: between -80.5 and -84.8 degrees West.

 The given coordinates (41.0798, -81.5219) fall within these ranges.

 Therefore, the place is in the state of Ohio.
