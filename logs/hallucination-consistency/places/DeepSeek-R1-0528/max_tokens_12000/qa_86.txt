We are given the coordinates: latitude 41.5725 and longitude -93.6105.
 We know that positive latitude is north and negative longitude is west (since the longitude is negative, it's west of the prime meridian).
 The coordinates are in the United States because the longitude is around -93 (which is in the central part of the US) and the latitude is around 41-42 (which is in the northern US).

 We can recall that the state of Iowa is located in the Midwest and its major city, Des Moines, is around 41.5째N and 93.6째W.

 Let's check:
 - Des Moines, Iowa has coordinates approximately 41.5868째 N, 93.6250째 W.

 The given coordinates (41.5725, -93.6105) are very close to Des Moines.

 Therefore, the state is Iowa.
