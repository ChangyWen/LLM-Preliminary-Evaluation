*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 35.3529 and longitude -119.0359.
 We know that in the United States, longitude is negative for the western hemisphere (west of the prime meridian) and latitude is positive for the northern hemisphere (above the equator).
 The coordinates (35.3529, -119.0359) are in the United States.

 We can recall that the state of California is located in the western US and has longitudes roughly between -124 and -114, and latitudes between about 32.5 and 42.

 Let's check:
   Latitude 35.3529 is between 32.5 and 42 -> within California's latitude range.
   Longitude -119.0359 is between -124 and -114 -> within California's longitude range.

 Moreover, we can note that the city of Bakersfield, California is approximately at (35.3733, -119.0187). The given coordinates are very close to that.

 Therefore, the state is California.

 Final answer:
