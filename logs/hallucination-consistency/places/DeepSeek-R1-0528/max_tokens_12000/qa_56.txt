We are given latitude 32.1541 and longitude -110.8787.
 Latitude 32.1541 is in the northern hemisphere (positive) and longitude -110.8787 is in the western hemisphere (negative).
 We are to find the state in the United States that this coordinate falls in.

 We know that the coordinates are within the United States because the longitude is around -110 and latitude around 32, which is in the southwestern part of the country.

 We can recall that the state of Arizona has coordinates in this range. Specifically, the city of Tucson, Arizona is around latitude 32.2 and longitude -110.9.

 Let's verify by checking known boundaries:

 - The state of Arizona is bounded approximately between:
   Latitude: 31.3°N to 37°N
   Longitude: 109.0°W to 114.8°W

 The given point (32.1541, -110.8787) is within these boundaries.

 Therefore, the place is in Arizona.

 However, to be thorough, let's consider neighboring states:

 - California: Longitude is more western (starting around 114.6°W to 120°W) and the latitude at that longitude (around 114) is around 32.5 to 34, but our longitude is -110 which is east of 114, so not in California.
 - New Mexico: Its western boundary is around 109°W, and the point -110.8787 is west of 109? Actually, -110.8787 is 110.8787 degrees west, which is more than 109 (meaning it is west of 109°W). But note: the western boundary of New Mexico is 109°W (the meridian at 109°W). Since -110.8787 is west of 109°W (because 110.8787 > 109), that means it is in Arizona, not New Mexico. New Mexico is from about 103°W to 109°W.
 - Nevada: Its longitude starts around 114°W to 120°W, and our longitude is -110.8787 (which is 110.8787°W) is east of 114°W, so not in Nevada.
 - Utah: Its southern boundary is around 37°N and it extends to about 109°W at the southeast corner (Four Corners). Our point is at 32.1541°N, which is well south of 37°N, so not in Utah.

 Thus, we are confident that the point is in Arizona.

 Final Answer:
Arizona

**************************************** Content ***************************************
The coordinates latitude 32.1541 and longitude -110.8787 correspond to a location in Tucson, Arizona. This is confirmed by cross-referencing the latitude and longitude with geographic boundaries. Arizona's typical latitude range is approximately 31°N to 37°N, and its longitude range is about 109°W to 114°W. The given point falls within these boundaries.

Arizona
