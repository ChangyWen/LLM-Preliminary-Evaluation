We are given the latitude 32.7817 and longitude -97.3474.
 We know that in the United States, negative longitude typically refers to the Western Hemisphere (west of the prime meridian). 
 The coordinates are in decimal degrees.

 We can use reverse geocoding to find the state. However, without using an API, we can rely on known landmarks or approximate regions.

 But note:
