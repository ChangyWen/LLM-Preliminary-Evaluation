*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 40.2457 and longitude -111.6457.
 We know that latitude is positive for the northern hemisphere and negative for the southern.
 Longitude is negative for the western hemisphere (especially for the USA, which is west of the prime meridian).

 The coordinates (40.2457, -111.6457) are in the United States. We need to determine the state.

 We can recall that the state of Utah is known for having a city called Provo with coordinates around 40.2338° N, 111.6585° W.
 Also, Brigham Young University is located in Provo, Utah.

 Let's compare:
   Latitude: 40.2457 is very close to 40.2338 (about 0.0119 degrees difference, which is about 1.3 km).
   Longitude: -111.6457 is very close to -111.6585 (about 0.0128 degrees difference, which is also about 1 km).

 Therefore, the coordinates are in Utah.

 However, to be thorough, we can also note that the coordinates fall within the boundaries of Utah.

 Final answer: Utah
