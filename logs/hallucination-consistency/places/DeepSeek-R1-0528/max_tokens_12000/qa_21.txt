*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 39.3051 and longitude -76.6144.
 Latitude: positive value (39.3051) indicates Northern Hemisphere.
 Longitude: negative value (-76.6144) indicates Western Hemisphere (so in the USA).

 We know that the coordinates are within the United States. We need to find the state.

 We can recall that the city of Baltimore is around these coordinates. Let me check:

 Baltimore, Maryland has coordinates approximately:
   Latitude: 39.2904° N
   Longitude: 76.6122° W

 But note: the given longitude is -76.6144 (which is equivalent to 76.6144° W). This is very close to Baltimore.

 However, to be precise, we can use our knowledge of US states and their approximate coordinates.

 Alternatively, we can think of major cities:

   - Washington, D.C. is around 38.9072° N, 77.0369° W -> not exact.
   - Philadelphia is around 39.9526° N, 75.1652° W -> too far east.

 But note: the coordinates 39.3051° N, 76.6144° W are indeed in the state of Maryland.

 Therefore, the state is Maryland.

 However, to be absolutely sure, we can also note that the coordinates are very close to the city of Baltimore, which is in Maryland.

 So the answer is Maryland.

 Final answer:
 Maryland
