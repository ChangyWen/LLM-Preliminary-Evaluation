*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 31.8476 and longitude -106.43.
 Latitude 31.8476 is positive, which in the northern hemisphere usually corresponds to the United States (since the US is in the Northern Hemisphere).
 Longitude -106.43 is negative, which in the western hemisphere. In the context of the US, this would be west of the prime meridian.

 We know that the state of Texas has a city named El Paso which is located near the coordinates (31.8, -106.4). 
 Let me check the approximate location:

 - The latitude 31.8476 is about 31.85° N.
 - The longitude -106.43 is about 106.43° W.

 Looking at a map, El Paso, Texas is at approximately 31.8° N, 106.4° W.

 Therefore, the coordinates (31.8476, -106.43) are very close to El Paso, Texas.

 Hence, the state is Texas.

 However, note that the coordinates might also be near the border of New Mexico. Let's double-check:

 The city of El Paso is in Texas, and the coordinates given are within the El Paso area.

 Alternatively, we can use a reverse geocoding service or a known database, but since we are to reason step by step, we can recall:

 - The state of Texas is bounded on the west by the 103rd meridian west? Actually, the westernmost part of Texas is at about 106.6° W, so -106.43 is within Texas.

 Also, note that the city of El Paso is at the western tip of Texas.

 Therefore, we can confidently say the state is Texas.

 Final answer:
Texas
