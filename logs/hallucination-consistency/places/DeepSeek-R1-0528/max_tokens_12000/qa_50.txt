*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 42.9018 and longitude -78.8487.
 We know that the United States uses latitude (positive for north, negative for south) and longitude (positive for east, negative for west). 
 So, 42.9018 N, 78.8487 W.

 We can recall that the state of New York has the city of Buffalo, which is near these coordinates.
 Alternatively, we can use reverse geocoding or known landmarks.

 However, without an external service, we can rely on knowledge:
 - The coordinates 42.90 N and 78.85 W are in the western part of New York state.
 - Specifically, these coordinates are very close to Buffalo, New York.

 Therefore, the state is New York.

 Let's confirm by checking known landmarks:
 - The coordinates 42.9018, -78.8487 point to a location in Buffalo, NY, specifically near the Buffalo Niagara International Airport.

 Hence, the state is New York.

 Final Answer:
 New York
