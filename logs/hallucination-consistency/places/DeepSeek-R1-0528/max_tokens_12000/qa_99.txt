*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given latitude 33.2175 and longitude -97.1418.
 We need to determine the state in the United States that this coordinate falls in.

 Steps:
 1. Recognize that the longitude is negative, which in the context of the United States means it is west of the prime meridian.
    Similarly, the latitude is positive, meaning it is in the northern hemisphere.

 2. We can use reverse geocoding to find the state. However, since we are not using an API, we can rely on known geographic knowledge or approximate boundaries.

 3. We note that the coordinates are:
    Latitude: 33.2175° N
    Longitude: 97.1418° W

 4. We can compare with the approximate boundaries of states in the US:

    - Texas is a large state that spans from approximately:
        - Latitude: 25.84° N to 36.5° N
        - Longitude: 93.5° W to 106.6° W

    - Oklahoma is above Texas and spans:
        - Latitude: 33.6° N to 37° N
        - Longitude: 94.4° W to 103° W

    - Louisiana is to the east of Texas and has:
        - Latitude: 28.9° N to 33.0° N
        - Longitude: 88.8° W to 94.0° W

    - Arkansas is to the northeast of Texas and has:
        - Latitude: 33.0° N to 36.5° N
        - Longitude: 89.6° W to 94.6° W

    - New Mexico is to the west of Texas and has:
        - Latitude: 31.3° N to 37° N
        - Longitude: 103.0° W to 109.0° W

 5. Our given point (33.2175° N, 97.1418° W) falls within the boundaries of Texas because:
    - Latitude 33.2175 is between 25.84 and 36.5 (Texas boundaries) and also within the typical range for North Texas.
    - Longitude 97.1418° W is between 93.5 and 106.6 (Texas boundaries).

 6. However, let's check if it might be in Oklahoma or Arkansas?

    - Oklahoma: The southern border of Oklahoma is at 33.6° N. Our latitude is 33.2175° N, which is less than 33.6° N, so it is below the Oklahoma state line. Therefore, it cannot be in Oklahoma.

    - Arkansas: The western border of Arkansas is approximately 94.6° W. Our longitude is 97.1418° W, which is west of 94.6° W. Therefore, it is too far west to be in Arkansas.

    - Louisiana: The western border of Louisiana is about 94.0° W. Our longitude 97.1418° W is west of that. Also, the northern border of Louisiana is at about 33.0° N. Our latitude is 33.2175° N, which is just above 33.0° N. However, the westernmost point of Louisiana is at 94.0° W, so 97.1418° W is too far west.

    - New Mexico: The eastern border of New Mexico is at 103.0° W. Our longitude is 97.1418° W, which is east of 103.0° W. Therefore, it is too far east to be in New Mexico.

 7. Therefore, the coordinates must be in Texas.

 8. To be precise, we can note that the city of Denton, Texas, is located at approximately 33.2148° N, 97.1331° W, which is very close to our given coordinates. Denton is in Texas.

 Conclusion: The place with latitude 33.2175 and longitude -97.1418 is in the state of Texas.

Final Answer:
Texas
