Okay, the user is asking about the state for a specific set of coordinates: latitude 35.8324 and longitude -78.6429. They also want the final answer on a new line at the end. 

First, I recognize these coordinates as likely being in the United States because of the negative longitude, which typically indicates the western hemisphere. The latitude around 35-36 degrees north often corresponds to the southern or mid-Atlantic US states. 

I recall that North Carolina's capital, Raleigh, is near these coordinates. Let me verify: yes, Raleigh sits at approximately 35.77°N, 78.64°W. The given coordinates (35.8324, -78.6429) are extremely close to that, just slightly north of downtown Raleigh. 

The user seems to need a quick, precise answer—maybe for logistics, travel planning, or a geography check. They specified the answer format clearly, so I'll ensure strict compliance. No extra fluff in the response except the essential confirmation and the cleanly formatted final line. 

Since this is a straightforward geolocation query, I'll skip unnecessary details unless asked. The coordinates unambiguously point to Raleigh, North Carolina, so no disclaimers are needed. Final answer locked in.
