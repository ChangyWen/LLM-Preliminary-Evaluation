*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
We are given the latitude and longitude: 40.0077, -75.1339.
 We need to determine the state in the United States that contains this location.
 Since the coordinates are in the United States (latitude around 40, longitude negative which is west, and the numbers match the Philadelphia area),
 we can recall that Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania.

 However, to be precise, we can note:
 - Latitude 40.0077 is very close to 40 degrees north.
 - Longitude -75.1339 is about 75 degrees west.

 The city of Philadelphia is at approximately 39.95째 N, 75.17째 W. The given coordinates are very close to that.

 Therefore, the state is Pennsylvania.

 Final answer:
 Pennsylvania
