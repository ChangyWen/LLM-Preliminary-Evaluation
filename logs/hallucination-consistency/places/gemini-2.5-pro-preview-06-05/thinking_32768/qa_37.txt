Okay, let's break this down. The user needs the state for a given lat/long. The question is straightforward.

First, let me grab the data: Latitude 39.9862, Longitude -82.9855. Hmm, okay.

These coordinates are in the Northern and Western hemispheres. That narrows it down to North America, and likely the US. Alright, let's strategize. I can either use an online geocoding tool or do a mental reverse geocode. Given my experience, my internal knowledge base *is* a geocoding service, and it's faster to use.

So, I input the coordinates in my head: lat: 39.9862, lon: -82.9855. *Searching...* Ah, that lands right in Columbus, Ohio. Specifically, it's near Ohio State University.

Next, I'll verify the result. Does it make sense? Ohio's latitude is around 38-42 degrees north, and the longitude is roughly -80 to -85 west. Bingo. The result is plausible.

Time to craft the response. I'll state the location and then provide the final answer as instructed. Let's see... "The place with latitude 39.9862 and longitude -82.9855 is located in Columbus, Ohio." and then the answer on a new line. I'll double-check that. Seems correct.

Let's review: accurate, concise, and it follows all the instructions. Looks good.

Ohio
