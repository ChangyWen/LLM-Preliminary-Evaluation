Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to figure out the state for those coordinates. That's the core question. Let's see, the latitude is 36.7335 and the longitude is -76.0435. Got it.

Now, let's break down those coordinates. The latitude is in the Northern Hemisphere and looks like it's somewhere in the southern part of the US. The longitude puts us in the Western Hemisphere, on the East Coast. Alright.

My strategy is to use a geocoding tool or a map search engine. I can just type those coordinates, "36.7335, -76.0435," into Google Maps. Let's see what comes up.

Okay, pasting that into Google Maps gives me a location. It's in Virginia Beach, near Princess Anne Road and General Booth Boulevard. Virginia Beach, right, that's a city in Virginia.

Does that make sense geographically? Virginia is on the East Coast, and its southern border is right around that latitude. The longitude fits with the southeastern part of the state, the Hampton Roads area. Yes, this checks out. The coordinates are pretty specific.

So, I'll give the answer directly. The place is in Virginia. And for a little extra context, I'll mention the city. The format is important, the answer on a new line.

The place with latitude 36.7335 and longitude -76.0435 is located in the state of Virginia. These coordinates fall within the city of Virginia Beach.

Virginia
