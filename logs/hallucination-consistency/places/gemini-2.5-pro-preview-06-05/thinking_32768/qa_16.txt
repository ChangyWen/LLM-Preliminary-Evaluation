Okay, so the user needs to know the state for a given latitude and longitude. Easy enough. First, I've got to grab the data: 44.9635, -93.2678. Right. Let's analyze those coordinates. Northern and Western Hemispheres, definitely US.

Next step: how to find the state? Geocoding tools or a simple search will do the trick. A query like "44.9635, -93.2678" in a search engine should work. Or I could use a map. Okay, let's just mentally plug those numbers in. Hmm... Google Maps, probably.

Alright, running the search (mentally). Yes, looks like Minneapolis, Minnesota. Got it. A geocoding API would spit out Minneapolis, Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States.

Now, to synthesize. The user's asking for the *state*. The coordinates point to Minneapolis, which is in Minnesota. I should provide a direct answer but also offer context.

How to format? The instructions are clear: final answer on a new line. So, I'll go with: "The location is in Minneapolis, Minnesota." Then a new line. Then the state name. Hmm, let's refine that.

User wants the state. Okay, let's get straight to the point: "That location is in the state of Minnesota." Followed by the answer on a new line.

Reviewing the request again. Yep, straightforward. Direct answer.

Let's keep it concise: "The place is in Minneapolis." Then a new line. Then "Minnesota". That's right.

That's right. Perfect. It's precise and respects the formatting. Good to go.

That location is in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Minnesota
