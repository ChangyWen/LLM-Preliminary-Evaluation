Okay, so someone wants to know the state given a latitude and longitude. Let's get this done efficiently.

First, I need to pull those coordinates out: 34.8354 for the latitude and -82.3646 for the longitude. Now, to determine the state, I need to do a quick geographical analysis. Latitude 34.8354 puts us in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -82.3646 is in the Western Hemisphere, indicating North America, and specifically the United States.

The most straightforward approach is to simply plug those coordinates into a geocoding tool or a search engine. I could type in "latitude 34.8354 longitude -82.3646" or, even simpler, "what state is at 34.8354, -82.3646."
