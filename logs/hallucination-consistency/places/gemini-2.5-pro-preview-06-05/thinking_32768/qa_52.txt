Okay, the user wants to know the state, given some coordinates. First, I need to get the important stuff: latitude 41.1918, longitude -73.1954. Let's analyze these. Positive latitude means Northern Hemisphere, negative longitude means Western Hemisphere. That puts us somewhere in North America, which is a good start.

Now, time to execute the plan. I'll use my mental map, plus some reverse geocoding. I'm thinking this location is in Connecticut. I can do a quick mental check. Connecticut is in the Northeast, and those coordinates feel right for that area.

I'll verify my guess. Checking the latitude and longitude ranges for Connecticut confirms it. It's a good match.

Okay, the user wants a direct answer, on a new line. I'll keep it simple.

That location is in the state of Connecticut.

Connecticut
