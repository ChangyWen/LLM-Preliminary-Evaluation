Okay, let's break this down. The core question is: what state corresponds to a given latitude and longitude? Alright, I've got the coordinates: 30.3322, -81.6749.

First, I need to analyze these coordinates. 30.3322 North puts us in the southern US, and -81.6749 West places us on the East Coast. My mind immediately starts to formulate a search strategy. I'd use a geocoding tool or just a search engine. Something like "latitude 30.3322 longitude -81.6749" or the more concise "30.3322, -81.6749".

Now I'm mentally running the search... Ah, yes, that points directly to Jacksonville. Where's Jacksonville? Right, it's a major city in Florida.

Time to verify. I'd picture a map of Florida in my head. Jacksonville is in the northeast corner. The longitude -81.6 aligns with the Florida's east coast, and the latitude 30.3 aligns with the northern part of Florida. Looks solid.

Okay, now to construct the answer. The user wants the state. So, I'll state the location for context, and then the state itself on a new line, as requested. How to phrase it? "The place with latitude 30.3322 and longitude -81.6749 is located in Jacksonville, Florida." Then, I'd present the final answer: "Florida."

Let's refine it. The ultimate goal is to answer the question directly, so "The place with latitude 30.3322 and longitude -81.6749 is located in the state of Florida." That's better. The final answer on a new line is requested, right?

Final check: Question: What state? Coordinates: 30.3322, -81.6749. Answer is Jacksonville, Florida. Therefore, the state is Florida. The format is "The place with latitude 30.3322 and longitude -81.6749 is located in the state of Florida.\n\nFlorida". Perfect.

Now, I'll provide the answer.
