*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know the state, given a latitude and longitude. Easy enough. First, I need to grab those coordinates. Let's see... 40.8501 for latitude and -73.8662 for longitude. Right. Now, a quick mental check. Northern Hemisphere, mid-latitude - probably US. Western Hemisphere, and a negative longitude, so it's the eastern coast of the US. I'm going to need to find out *exactly* where that is.

Time for a search strategy. I can either use a geocoding tool, or I can just run a search. "40.8501, -73.8662" should do it. Let's see... *mental search commences* ... Ah, right. Those coordinates put me in the Bronx, New York City. Okay. Since the user wants the state, I'm going to be a bit more specific in my response. I'll note that it's in the Bronx, NYC, just to be thorough. Then I'll give the state.

So, I'll construct my response. "The place with latitude 40.8501 and longitude -73.8662 is located in the Bronx, a borough of New York City." Now, the direct answer, on a new line as requested:

New York
