Okay, so the user needs to know the state for a given latitude and longitude. Let's see, I have the coordinates: 33.7977 and -118.167. First, let's quickly check that these are valid coordinates. The latitude is in the Northern Hemisphere, the longitude in the Western Hemisphere, which is consistent with the U.S. Let's find that location. My plan is to geocode these using a mental process, essentially like using a map in my head. I visualize those coordinates, 33.7977, -118.167... I'm thinking of Long Beach, California. Let me verify. Does the range of California's coordinates include these? Yes, it does. So, I'm pretty confident. Now, how do I formulate the final answer? The user just wants the state. I should be concise and follow the formatting instruction. I'll state the location and the state. Let's see: "The place with latitude 33.7977 and longitude -118.167 is located in California." Then, the final answer on a new line:

California
