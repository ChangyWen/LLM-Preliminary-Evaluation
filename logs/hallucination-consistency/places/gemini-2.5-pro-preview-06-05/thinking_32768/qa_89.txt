Okay, the user's question is clear: they need the state for a given latitude and longitude. The data is 40.5834, -74.1496.  Alright, let's analyze this.  40.5834 is North, and -74.1496 is West – that points to North America, specifically the US.  My next step is to use a geocoding tool – maybe a quick search using those coordinates. "Geocode 40.5834, -74.1496"... Got it, that lands on Staten Island. Staten Island is part of New York City, and New York City is in the state of New York.  A quick check on Google Maps confirms that, right near South Beach.

Now, let's formulate the response.  The user just wants the state. The best way is to just give the state. The user asked for it on a new line.

That location is in the state of New York.

New York
