Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to figure out the state for a given set of coordinates. Let's see... the latitude is 41.5725 and the longitude is -93.6105. Right, so latitude is in the Northern Hemisphere, and the longitude puts us in the Western Hemisphere. That narrows things down considerably; we're likely in North America, specifically in the US.

Next step is to actually find out where these coordinates are. I could use a geocoding tool, but I'm experienced enough to do a mental search first. Let's see... those coordinates are ringing a bell... Right, a quick search in my memory reveals Des Moines, Iowa.

Now, let's verify this. Iowa's latitude ranges are approximately 40 to 43 degrees north. Bingo, 41.5725 falls right in the middle. Longitude ranges are roughly 90 to 97 degrees west. Yep, -93.6105 is also right there. This seems very specific. Thinking further, this location is near the Iowa State Capitol. Excellent, Des Moines, the capital of Iowa.

Alright, time to assemble the answer. The coordinates are in Des Moines, Iowa. And, the question was about the state, so the state is Iowa. Let's format this for clarity. The best way to give the answer is to immediately state the information, and then put the final answer on a new line. 

Here's the final version:

The coordinates 41.5725, -93.6105 are located in Des Moines, Iowa.
Iowa
