Okay, the user wants to know the state for a specific set of coordinates. Easy enough. Let's see... first, I need to pull out the data: latitude 36.1283, longitude -95.9042. Now, I have a plan. I'll convert these coordinates to a location using my internal geocoding knowledge, which is pretty robust, and if I need to, I can simulate a quick search. These coordinates are clearly in decimal degrees, the standard. Latitude of 36.1283 is in the northern hemisphere, and longitude -95.9042 is in the western hemisphere. Combining those facts suggests North America, likely the United States.

Okay, let's mentally check... Central US is generally around -90 to -100 longitude, and 30-40 latitude. Texas is further south, Kansas a bit north, and Oklahoma seems likely. Arkansas is to the east, Missouri north and east. Okay, so those coordinates, 36.1283 N, -95.9042 W... almost definitely Oklahoma.

Now, let's fire up that mental tool. *Geocode 36.1283, -95.9042*. Ah, the result comes back... Tulsa, Oklahoma. Near the University of Tulsa, or maybe Expo Square. So, the city is Tulsa, and the state is Oklahoma.

Alright, time to construct the answer. I'll start with a clear statement, and add some context. "The coordinates 36.1283, -95.9042 are located in Tulsa, Oklahoma," is good, but the user just wanted the state. How about, "That location is in the state of Oklahoma. More specifically, it's in the city of Tulsa." Then, I'll drop the final answer on a new line as requested.

*Final review* Does it answer the question? Yes. Is it accurate? Absolutely. Does it follow formatting? Yes.

Okay. Ready to deliver.

Oklahoma
