Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to understand exactly what the user is asking. They want to know the state for a given set of coordinates. Alright, easy enough. Let me pull the important numbers out: latitude 40.7498 and longitude -73.7976. Now, let's analyze these. 40.7498 is a positive latitude, meaning it's in the Northern Hemisphere. And -73.7976 is a negative longitude, so it's in the Western Hemisphere. That puts us squarely in the US, probably somewhere on the East Coast.

Next, let's figure out the most efficient way to find the location. I'll use a geocoding tool or map search. Inputting "40.7498, -73.7976" should give us a pinpoint. Given my knowledge, -74 longitude is around New York City, and this is close. Also, 40.7498 is also in the area of NYC and Long Island. I can make an educated guess, but let's be precise. I'll do a quick mental search, or if needed, I'd use a map service like Google Maps.

Right, I *know* that those coordinates are located somewhere in Queens, in New York City, specifically near Bayside, Queens. I know Queens is a borough of New York City, and New York City is in the state of New York.

Now, to synthesize this into a concise answer. It's about providing only the state. The place with latitude 40.7498 and longitude -73.7976 is located in New York.

Let's double-check: Does this directly answer the user's question? Yes. Is it formatted correctly? Yes. Is it accurate? Absolutely.

New York
