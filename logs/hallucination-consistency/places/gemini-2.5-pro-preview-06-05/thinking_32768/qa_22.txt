Okay, the core question is straightforward: find the state for the given latitude and longitude. Let's see, the coordinates are 36.2333, -115.2654. I immediately recognize that latitude as being in the northern hemisphere, specifically in the southern U.S. Longitude -115.2654 is in the Western Hemisphere, putting it in the western United States.

The fastest way to solve this is with a reverse geocoding tool. I could do this mentally, but it's more efficient to use something like Google Maps or a geocoding API to confirm. I'll input the coordinates – 36.2333, -115.2654 – and expect to get back a place name, likely with the city, state, and country.

Hmm, let's see... a quick search… Ah, yes, the location is in or very near Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas is a major city. Alright, so we have a city. Now, what state is Las Vegas in? Nevada, of course.

To confirm, let's quickly check. The coordinates for Nevada generally are between about 35° and 42° North latitude, and between 114° and 120° West longitude. Our coordinates fit nicely within that range. It's spot on.

Okay, the user needs the state. I will offer a clear, concise answer.

That location is in the state of Nevada, specifically in the northwestern part of the Las Vegas metropolitan area.

Nevada
