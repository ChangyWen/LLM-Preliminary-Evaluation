Okay, so the core question is: what state is this location in? Right, let's get the data: latitude 31.8476 and longitude -106.43. Quick analysis... that latitude is in the Northern Hemisphere, and the longitude is in the Western Hemisphere. That puts us in North America, likely the US. Now, let's formulate a strategy to figure this out. I could use a geocoding tool, but my mental map is usually pretty good. I'll mentally search for those coordinates. -106.43 longitude... that's roughly the Mountain Time zone, western US. States like New Mexico and Texas come to mind, and the latitude... it's fairly far south. Hmm, near the US-Mexico border. Let's cross-reference... El Paso, Texas, is close to that. Ah, the southern border of New Mexico dips down near El Paso. Okay, let's see... El Paso is around 31.76° N, 106.48° W. These coordinates are slightly north of El Paso. Let's pinpoint it. I'll plug these numbers into my mental geographic knowledge. Actually, I'll refine the search. Ah, this falls near the town of Anthony, which straddles the Texas-New Mexico border. The state line... it runs right through here. I'll double check. The Texas-New Mexico border in this area is roughly at -106.45° W. And since our longitude is *east* of that (-106.43), it's in Texas. So, those coordinates are in Texas. My response needs to be formatted with a clear statement and the final answer on a new line. Right, perfect!

Texas
