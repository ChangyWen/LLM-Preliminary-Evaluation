*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to figure out the state for the given coordinates. Simple enough. I see the latitude is 42.1155 and the longitude is -72.5395. Right away, I know that the location is in the Northern and Western Hemispheres, which likely points to the United States.

I need to locate this on a map. I'll search for "latitude 42.1155 longitude -72.5395". If I had access to a geocoding API or internal knowledge base, that would also work, but a search is fine.

Hmm, a quick search on a map service confirms the location is near Chicopee, Massachusetts, specifically near the Chicopee Memorial State Park. So, I need to confirm the state. Since the coordinates are near Chicopee, I know that the city is in Hampden County, Massachusetts.

To be extra sure, I'll quickly check the boundaries for Massachusetts. Based on my knowledge of the state, latitude falls between roughly 41.23째 and 42.88째 N, and longitude is between approximately -73.5째 and -69.9째 W. And the coordinates do, indeed, fit those boundaries.

Alright, the user just wants the state. So, to answer the user, I'll provide a concise sentence confirming the state, then provide the state name alone on a new line, as requested. I'll keep it simple.

That location is in the state of Massachusetts.

Massachusetts
