Okay, let's break this down. The user wants the state for a given lat/long. Simple enough. First, I need to pull out the coordinates: 40.2457 North and -111.6457 West. Right, got it. Now, I know I'm dealing with a location in the US, specifically in the Mountain West region given that longitude. The latitude clearly puts it in the Northern Hemisphere and the continental United States.

To be absolutely sure, I'll use my internal knowledge – essentially, the best geocoding model there is. I could also simulate a search, which is exactly what I'd be doing if I didn't have this. So, I mentally plug those coordinates into the system. The expected output would be the specific location.

Based on my internal knowledge, those coordinates point to Provo, Utah. I'll double-check. Provo, Utah's coordinates are around 40.23 North, 111.65 West. Hmm, my coordinates are very close. To be even *more* certain, I would check an external source, like Google Maps, just for corroboration. I can literally "see" it in my mind's eye. "40.2457, -111.6457" – Yep, it's right by BYU. Confirmed.

So, the city is Provo, and the state is Utah. Excellent. Now, to give the user the right answer in the requested format, I need to be succinct. The prompt explicitly asks for the *state*, so that's what I'll give. The user wants the answer on a new line. Fine.

The place with latitude 40.2457 and longitude -111.6457 is located in Utah.

Utah
