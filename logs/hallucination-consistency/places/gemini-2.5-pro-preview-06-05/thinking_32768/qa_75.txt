Okay, let's break this down. The user needs the state for a given latitude and longitude. That's the core question. I need to find the location for 30.442, -91.1311.

First, I analyze the coordinates. Northern and Western Hemispheres – that puts us in North America, specifically the US. I could use a geocoding tool, but with a quick mental process, I can go directly to a map tool, or I could use a search engine. I'll mentally plug those numbers into Google Maps.

The results point to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, specifically near the LSU campus. Baton Rouge is the capital, and the coordinates fall right within that geographic range.

Now, is the answer correct? Let's verify. Louisiana’s latitudinal and longitudinal ranges are within the provided coordinate parameters. Perfect.

Now, I need to construct the final answer precisely as requested. The user wants the state. Let’s give it some context. I'll say, "The location with latitude 30.442 and longitude -91.1311 is in Baton Rouge, Louisiana." and, on a separate line, the answer:

Louisiana
