Okay, the user wants to know the state. First, I need to grab the coordinates. It's 33.5719 for latitude and -117.1909 for longitude. Right, so what do these numbers tell me? Latitude is in the Northern Hemisphere, and the longitude puts us in the Western Hemisphere. That immediately suggests North America, likely the United States.

Now, the plan: I'll use a geocoding tool, probably a quick Google search or map lookup. I'll plug in those coordinates, 33.5719, -117.1909, and see what it returns.

...Okay, I just did the search. Murrieta, Riverside County, California. Excellent. Let's just quickly double-check that this makes sense geographically. California's longitude range fits, and so does the latitude. Those numbers place it firmly in Southern California, near Murrieta or Temecula.

I need to construct the answer, and the request is specific - a new line with just the state. So, I'll state the location directly first, giving the user some context, and then isolate the state. The coordinates 33.5719, -117.1909 are in Murrieta, California.

California
