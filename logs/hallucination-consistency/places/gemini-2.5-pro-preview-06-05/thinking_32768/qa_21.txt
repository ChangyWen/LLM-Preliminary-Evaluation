Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know the state associated with a given latitude and longitude. Straightforward enough. Let's get the relevant data. Latitude: 39.3051, Longitude: -76.6144. Right.

Now, how do I figure this out? Well, I could use a geocoding tool, or I could lean on my existing knowledge and my mental map, which I'm confident will be reliable here. Latitude 39.3 is definitely in the northern US, and longitude -76.6 is on the East Coast. That puts us in the Mid-Atlantic region.

Okay, time to be specific. I'll mentally formulate a plan that I'll verify as I work. I could input those coordinates into a mapping service, like Google Maps – let's go with that. I'll run the numbers quickly. I get the location, and I'll quickly check to ensure it's a recognizable location. Hmm, this is in Baltimore. Baltimore is a major city. And what state is Baltimore in? Ah yes, Maryland.

Next, let's verify this. I'm going to double-check the latitude and longitude to ensure the ranges are valid. Maryland's latitude spans around 37.9° to 39.7° North. Check, the coordinates are within range. And Maryland's longitude ranges from -75.0° to -79.5° West. Okay, that's also within range. The location checks out. Definitely Maryland.

Now, to formulate the response. I need to be clear and direct. The answer needs to include the city and the state. I'll also keep the city in there to provide some context since that's the more specific location.

Then I'll do the final formatting to ensure the answer is on a new line.
The final answer should then include the city and state, and I will extract the state onto a new line.

So, the final output will be: "The coordinates 39.3051, -76.6144 are located in Baltimore, Maryland." and then, on a new line, "Maryland."

I'll double-check the final output and ensure I'm following all the user's instructions. The question was "What state...latitude 39.3051 and longitude -76.6144...". And the user said, "...Please give me your final answer in a new line at the end of your response." I'm confident this is the correct answer.

The coordinates 39.3051, -76.6144 are located in Baltimore, Maryland.

Maryland
