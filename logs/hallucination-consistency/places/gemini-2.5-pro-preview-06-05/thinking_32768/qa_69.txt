Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know the state, given a latitude and longitude. Easy enough. First, I need to grab those coordinates â€“ looks like it's 26.6443 North and -81.9957 West. Right, let's break this down. Positive latitude means Northern Hemisphere, and that puts us squarely in the US. That degree of latitude puts it somewhere in the southern US. The negative longitude? Western Hemisphere, so in the US again, but on the East Coast or towards it.

Now, how to find the state... I could use a geocoding tool, or maybe just a map lookup service. Input the coordinates and let the tool do its work. Since I *am* the tool, in a way, I'll just fire up my internal knowledge, my mental geocoding database.

Input: latitude 26.6443, longitude -81.9957. Searching... Okay, I've got it. Cape Coral, Lee County, Florida, USA. Let's just double-check; make sure it feels right. Florida is roughly between 24 and 31 degrees north, and -80 and -87 west. Yep, those numbers fit. That location is on the Gulf Coast, close to Fort Myers. Cape Coral *is* right there, so it checks out.

Okay, time to formulate the answer. I should probably give a bit of context before the main answer. Cape Coral, Florida. The user *specifically* wants the state, so I should keep it simple and direct. And, of course, they said to put the final answer on its own line. Got it.

Here's the full response: "The coordinates 26.6443, -81.9957 are located in Cape Coral, Florida."

Florida
