Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know the state for a specific set of coordinates: 32.8168 latitude and -79.9687 longitude. My first instinct is to run those numbers through a geocoding tool or a map service, like Google Maps.  I immediately recognize the latitude as positive and the longitude as negative, meaning this location is in the Northern and Western Hemispheres respectively, so probably North America.

I can input those coordinates directly, "32.8168, -79.9687", and see where it lands.  Oh, that points to Daniel Island in Charleston, South Carolina.  Okay, that confirms my initial hemisphere guess.  Charleston is definitely in South Carolina. The user's question is straightforward; they just want the state.  Therefore, the answer is "South Carolina".  The user also requested that the final answer be on a new line at the end. So, let's provide the answer directly.

That location is in the state of South Carolina.

South Carolina
