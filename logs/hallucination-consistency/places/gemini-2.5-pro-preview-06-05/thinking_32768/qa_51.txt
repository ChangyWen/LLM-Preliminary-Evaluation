Okay, the user wants the state for those coordinates. Let's see... latitude 35.4676, longitude -97.5136. Hmm, looks like a US location, definitely Northern and Western Hemispheres. I'll need to do a reverse geocode, essentially figuring out the address based on the coordinates. A quick search on a map service should do the trick. "35.4676, -97.5136"... Ah, Oklahoma City. Now, does that check out? Latitude's right, longitude's right... Central Oklahoma, close to where I expected. Perfect.

Now, the answer. Straightforward. The user wants the state on a new line. Okay, got it. The place with those coordinates is in Oklahoma.

The place with latitude 35.4676 and longitude -97.5136 is located in the state of Oklahoma.

Oklahoma
