*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's break this down. The user wants the state for a given latitude and longitude. My brain immediately registers this as a geocoding problem â€“ reverse geocoding, specifically. I need to map these coordinates to a political entity.

First, I grab the data: Latitude 36.783, Longitude -119.7939. Now, let's see...I can probably just pull this from memory, but let's think systematically. Roughly, that's about 36.7 degrees North and 119.8 degrees West. The West Coast...that's around -120 to -124 degrees longitude, and California is roughly 32.5 to 42 degrees North. Yup, those coordinates fit right in.

Okay, time to do the lookup, even if it's a mental one. I'll virtually input those coordinates and ask myself, "What city/state are these coordinates in?" Hmm...Central Valley of California, likely. Aha! I'm thinking it's very close to Fresno. A quick mental check: Fresno is definitely in California.

So, let's construct the answer. I need a clear, direct answer, and since the user likely doesn't know the exact location, it's best to provide some context. I'll write: "The place with latitude 36.783 and longitude -119.7939 is located in Fresno, California."

And now, for the final answer, as requested by the user:

California
