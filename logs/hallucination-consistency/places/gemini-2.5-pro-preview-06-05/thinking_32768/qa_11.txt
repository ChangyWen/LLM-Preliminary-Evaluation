Okay, so the user needs to know the state for a given latitude and longitude. Let's get down to business. First, I need the crucial data: the coordinates. I see 33.5722 for latitude and -112.0892 for longitude. Got it.

Now, let's break this down. Latitude 33.5722 puts us in the Northern Hemisphere. Longitude -112.0892 puts us in the Western Hemisphere. That generally points towards North America and, given my experience, probably the United States.

Alright, time to formulate a plan. I'll use a geocoding tool – probably Google Maps or my own internal system. Input the coordinates: 33.5722, -112.0892. The tool should reverse geocode those coordinates, giving me a place name.

I'm mentally running through the process now. I know those coordinates are near Phoenix, Arizona. To double-check, I'll mentally input the coordinates, knowing Phoenix is roughly at 33.4° N and 112.0° W. Yup, the numbers check out. I can further confirm with some quick searches to confirm this and narrow down the possibilities.

Okay, let's assemble the answer. The coordinates must be in *a* state. The state is Arizona. I could add the city, Phoenix, for more context, but the user just asked for the state. Let's not get fancy.

Now, I have to follow instructions. The final answer goes on a new line.

The place with latitude 33.5722 and longitude -112.0892 is located in Arizona.

Ready to go!

Arizona
