Okay, so the user wants to know the state given a latitude and longitude. Right, let's break this down methodically. First, the coordinates: 40.5961, -75.4756.  Now, I need to figure out where those are.  Latitude tells me north or south; this is in the Northern Hemisphere. Longitude gives east or west; this is in the Western Hemisphere. That's North America, likely the US.

Time to find the state.  I'll need a geocoding tool or map.  I could use Google Maps, or if this was an API call, I'd do that. Either way, I input the coordinates, 40.5961, -75.4756. The tool will spit back a location, hopefully with city, county, state, and country.

Let's use a search engine. Okay, Google Maps.  Inputted. Ah, Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Let me double-check; Allentown's coordinates are roughly 40.6 N, 75.4 W, which confirms it.  Specifically near the Lehigh Valley Mall, but the key is Pennsylvania.

Now, to answer the question directly.  The user wants the state on its own line.  First, I'll give some context. I could say, "Those coordinates are in Allentown, Pennsylvania." But, the *primary* answer is the state itself.  So, I'll phrase it: "The coordinates 40.5961, -75.4756 are located in Allentown, Pennsylvania." But, that's not precisely what's asked. Maybe: "That location is in the state of Pennsylvania." Yep, or simply "The place with latitude 40.5961 and longitude -75.4756 is located in Pennsylvania." But I really need the state answer by itself on its own line.

So, I'll go with:

"The coordinates 40.5961, -75.4756 are located in Allentown, Pennsylvania."

Then a new line:

"Pennsylvania"

Perfect. It's complete, provides useful information, and the final answer is formatted as requested. Ready to go.
