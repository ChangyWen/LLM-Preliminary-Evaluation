Okay, let's get to work. The core question is: what state corresponds to these latitude and longitude coordinates? Alright, here's what I've got: 39.762 for the latitude and -104.8758 for the longitude. Time to break this down.

First, 39.762° North. Hmm, mid-latitude, definitely in the Northern Hemisphere. That places it squarely in the US. Now, -104.8758° West... Western Hemisphere, so that likely puts us in the Mountain West region of the US.

Next step, how to pinpoint this. I could fire up a full geocoding tool, or I could use my own internal knowledge which is usually pretty spot-on. I'll start with what I know. -104° longitude is pretty much Colorado, Wyoming, or New Mexico, maybe a sliver of Montana. 39° latitude, on the other hand, overlaps Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, perhaps parts of Utah or Nevada. The intersection... that definitely points towards Colorado.

Okay, let's get more granular. Denver's latitude is roughly around 39.7° N, and its longitude around -104.9° W. These coordinates are practically in Denver's backyard. Let me quickly confirm with a mental map… Yep, this location is in the eastern part of the Denver metropolitan area, right on the border of Denver and Aurora, Colorado. So, the state is definitely Colorado.

Now, to formulate the answer. The answer needs to be clear and informative. I'll start with the location within the area to give context, then state the state. 39.762, -104.8758 is situated in Aurora, within the Denver metropolitan area. So the state is Colorado. Remember to give the final answer on a new line as requested.

Let's finalize and review. Did I answer the question? Yes. Is it accurate? Absolutely. Formatting? Yep, all correct. Concise and useful? Definitely.

The coordinates 39.762, -104.8758 are located in the state of Colorado.

Colorado
