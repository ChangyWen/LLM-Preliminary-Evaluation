Alright, the user's question is straightforward: what state is at these coordinates? First, I need to isolate the key data: latitude 41.3113 and longitude -72.9246. Okay, analyzing those numbers... North latitude, West longitude. That tells me North America, specifically the US.

Next, I'll use my go-to method: reverse geocoding. I'll mentally plug those coordinates into a tool â€“ Google Maps is usually the fastest for this. I know the tool will return a location, likely including city, state, and country.

Thinking this through, 41.3113, -72.9246... *New Haven, Connecticut* just popped into my head. That's probably right, especially considering the latitude/longitude ranges for Connecticut. Let's do a quick check. Yep, those coordinates definitely fall within Connecticut's boundaries.

Now, the answer. I'll keep it concise but helpful, as requested. The place with latitude 41.3113 and longitude -72.9246 is located in the state of Connecticut. More specifically, these coordinates are in the city of New Haven.

Connecticut
