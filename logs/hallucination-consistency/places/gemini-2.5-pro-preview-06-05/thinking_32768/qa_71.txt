Okay, let's see... the user wants to know the state for a given latitude and longitude. My first task is to isolate the crucial information: latitude 37.9722 and longitude -122.0016. Alright, let's mentally process those coordinates. Latitude 37.9722 puts us in the Northern Hemisphere, and -122.0016 is in the Western Hemisphere. Those coordinates sound very US-ish.

Now, I need to formulate a plan to find the exact location. I'll mentally reach for a geocoding tool or a mapping service, like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap, and plug in those coordinates. Let's see, typing in "37.9722, -122.0016"...Ah, the search results point directly to Concord, California, near the Concord Naval Weapons Station. That puts it in Contra Costa County, which is definitely in California.

Time to cross-check. Does the latitude fit? Yup, California spans from about 32.5째 to 42째 North. And the longitude? Yep, California goes from roughly -114째 to -124째 West. Confirmed. Those coordinates are smack-dab in California, in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Right, the user wants the state. So, the coordinates point to Concord, California... which means the state is California. And now for the final formatting. I'll give a direct answer and then stick the final answer on its own line, as requested.

The coordinates 37.9722 latitude and -122.0016 longitude are located in the state of California. More specifically, this location is in the city of Concord, California.

California
