Okay, so the user wants to know the state given a latitude and longitude. Easy enough. First, I grab those coordinates: 39.1413 and -84.506. Hmm, latitude is north, longitude is west – definitely in the US. To figure out *which* state, I'll need a geocoding tool. I'd likely use something like Google Maps or maybe even just punch it into my internal database (that is to say, my knowledge).

Right, let's see. Inputting "39.1413, -84.506"... Ah, it's near Cincinnati, Ohio. Quick sanity check – "Cincinnati, OH coordinates"... Yup, those align. Specifically, it looks like the University of Cincinnati or Clifton neighborhood area. Definitely Ohio.

So, the coordinates point to Cincinnati, Ohio. The user asked for the *state*, and the state is Ohio.

I'll format it as requested: a quick conversational lead-in, then the answer on its own line.

The location with latitude 39.1413 and longitude -84.506 is in the state of Ohio.

Ohio
