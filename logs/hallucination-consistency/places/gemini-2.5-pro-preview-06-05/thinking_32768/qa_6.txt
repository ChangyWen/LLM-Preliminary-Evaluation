Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know the state for a given latitude and longitude: 29.786, -95.3885. Right, that's straightforward, it's a geocoding problem. I'll need to map those coordinates to a state. My internal model should have this data, so I don't need external tools. The question "What is at latitude 29.786, longitude -95.3885?" should give me a starting point. Then I'll refine from there. First result is Houston. Okay, but the user wants the state. So, "What state is Houston in?". That should be Texas.

Let's verify. The latitude and longitude make sense for the US. And I know Texas is roughly between 25°N and 36°N latitude, and 93°W and 106°W longitude, so those coordinates fit squarely in Texas. And wait, Houston's coordinates are approximately 29.76° N, 95.36° W! So, the given coordinates are a near match, and confirming the location is in Houston.

Now for the answer. I need to be direct and helpful. The coordinates are in Houston, Texas, but the final answer is just the state. I'll add that in a new line. Right, let's put it together.

The coordinates 29.786 latitude and -95.3885 longitude are located in the state of Texas. More specifically, this is a location within the city of Houston.
