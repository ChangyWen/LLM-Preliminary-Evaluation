Okay, so the user needs to know the state for a given latitude and longitude. Let's see, they provided the coordinates, so I'll extract the data: Latitude: 40.6501 and Longitude: -73.9496.  Now, let's break this down. 40.6501 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and -73.9496 puts us in the Western Hemisphere. Hmm... that puts us in the northeastern United States.

I need to figure out precisely where those coordinates are. I'll quickly geocode them, or I could just do a quick search. I'll type in "latitude 40.6501 longitude -73.9496" â€“ or maybe just "40.6501, -73.9496". Right, a quick search confirms it. It's Brooklyn, New York City. Brooklyn's part of New York City, and New York City is, of course, in the state of New York.

So, the coordinates are in Brooklyn. Brooklyn's in New York City. And New York City is in the state of New York. So, the user is asking about New York.

Now, I need to format the final answer like they requested. I should start with a clear answer, provide some context... then the final answer, on its own line.

The place with latitude 40.6501 and longitude -73.9496 is located in Brooklyn, New York City.

New York
