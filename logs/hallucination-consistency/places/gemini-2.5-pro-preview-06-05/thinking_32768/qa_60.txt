Okay, let's get this done. First, what's the real question here? Right, the user wants the state for a given lat/long. Easy enough. Now, let's pull out those coordinates. Got them: 35.1054, -106.6465. Hmm... 35.1054 is definitely north, -106.6465 is west, and those numbers look familiar. Definitely within the US.

Now, the plan. Reverse geocode, quick and simple. I could use a geocoding service, but frankly, I can probably do this mentally. Let's plug those coordinates into my internal map database, which is basically my brain. "35.1054, -106.6465"... Ah, that's Albuquerque. Big city.

Now, what state? Gotta confirm this to be absolutely sure. Let's see, Albuquerque... I think... Yes, New Mexico. Okay, but always verify. Latitude range for New Mexico... roughly 31 to 37 degrees North. Yep, 35.1054 fits. Longitude... about -103 to -109 West. That matches too. Checks out. The specific location appears to be near the University of New Mexico. Confirmed, New Mexico.

Now for the answer. Gotta keep it clear and concise, and follow the format. Context first: "The coordinates 35.1054, -106.6465 are located in Albuquerque." Then, the final answer, on a new line.

Right. Final check. Did I address the user's question? Yes. Did I put the final answer on a new line as requested? Yes. Okay, here we go.

The coordinates 35.1054, -106.6465 are located in Albuquerque.

New Mexico
