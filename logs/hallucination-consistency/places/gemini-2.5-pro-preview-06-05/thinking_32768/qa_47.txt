Okay, here's my thought process: The user needs to know the state corresponding to specific latitude and longitude coordinates. Let's see... First, I need to grab those coordinates: 35.1087 and -89.9663. Then, I immediately do a quick geographical assessment. Latitude 35 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and longitude -89 is west of the Prime Meridian. That combination screams North America, and most likely, the United States.

Alright, now the plan. I'll need to use a geocoding tool. Could be Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, any of those. I'll plug in those coordinates and let the tool do the heavy lifting to figure out the location. Let's mentally do it. I'll type those coordinates into Google Maps... aha, it comes back with Memphis, Tennessee. Cool! Near the University of Memphis, it appears. So the important part of the answer is "Memphis, TN."

Now the easy part: the state. The state is Tennessee. I need to formulate the response. The answer should be straightforward and give a little context, like the city. And of course, I have to remember that formatting request: "final answer on a new line." Let me write something like, "The place with latitude 35.1087 and longitude -89.9663 is located in Memphis, Tennessee." Then, add the final answer on a new line. I'll review. Direct answer? Check. Accuracy? Checked. Formatting? Double-checked. Alright, I'm good. Ready to send.

Tennessee
