Okay, let's break this down. The user's asking for the state given a latitude and longitude. Easy enough. First, I grab the data: latitude 41.8375, longitude -87.6866. Now, let's analyze those coordinates. Hmm, definitely in the Northern and Western Hemispheres, and those coordinates are clearly within the United States.

Next, I need a plan to get the answer. The obvious approach is to use a geocoding tool or map service. I'll just plug those coordinates in and let the system do the work of telling me the address. I'll have to do a search. Let me just quickly check in my head, see... -87 longitude, roughly central US, maybe around Illinois. And 41 latitude puts us up in the northern part of the country. Looks like Illinois is the likely spot. And, those numbers are really close to Chicago.

Okay, let me fire up a search... Yep, Google Maps shows it's Pilsen, Chicago. Chicago is in Illinois. Now I just need to put together a good response. I'll start by saying the coordinates point to Chicago. And then, directly answering the question: Chicago is in Illinois.

I should combine those into a concise statement, and I need to make sure the final answer is on a new line. Okay, all set.

The place with latitude 41.8375 and longitude -87.6866 is located in Chicago, Illinois.

Illinois
