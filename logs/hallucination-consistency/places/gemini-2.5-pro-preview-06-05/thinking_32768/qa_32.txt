Alright, the user's asking for the state, given some latitude and longitude. Easy enough. First, I've got to pull out those coordinates: 40.7834 North latitude and -73.9662 West longitude. Hmm, those definitely look like they're in the Northern and Western Hemispheres, which narrows it down geographically. Based on those values, that's going to be somewhere in the northeastern US.

So, I'll just fire up my mental geocoder, or maybe even a quick online search, and plug those numbers in. I'll probably search something like "latitude 40.7834 longitude -73.9662" or even just the coordinate pair. Yep, a quick mental check confirms it. Those coordinates point directly to Manhattan, in New York City. Manhattan is a borough of New York City, and New York City is, of course, in the state of New York. I'm going to present my answer in a complete sentence, as a courtesy, before stating the answer in the format they requested.

The place with latitude 40.7834 and longitude -73.9662 is located in Manhattan, New York City.

New York
