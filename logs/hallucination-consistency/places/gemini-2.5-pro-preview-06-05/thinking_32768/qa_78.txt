Alright, here's what I'm thinking. First, the core of the question: they want the state given a latitude and longitude. Okay, let's get the numbers. Latitude: 42.6664. Longitude: -73.7987. Hmm, let me analyze these. Latitude in the Northern Hemisphere, longitude in the Western Hemisphere... that's pointing to North America, most likely the US or maybe Canada. Time to formulate a plan. I'll need to reverse geocode these. A geocoding tool or even a quick search on Google Maps will do the trick. Let's just plug it in. "42.6664, -73.7987"... Okay, the results are crystal clear – it’s right around Albany, New York. Specifically, near the University at Albany, SUNY. The city is Albany. Time for a quick check. Albany’s coordinates are around 42.65° N, 73.75° W. My coordinates are very close! Confirmed, the location is in or right near Albany. So, the state is definitely New York. Now, to format this correctly. The main body has to clearly answer the question. And the state name, on a new line, at the end. Right. Let's get this right. Okay, the response should read: "The place with latitude 42.6664 and longitude -73.7987 is located in the state of New York. More specifically, these coordinates point to a location in the city of Albany." And then, on the next line, just the state. Right. Seems spot on. Let's finalize it.

New York
