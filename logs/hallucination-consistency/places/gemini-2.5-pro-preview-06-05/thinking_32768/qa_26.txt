Okay, so the user needs to know the state for a given latitude and longitude. Let's see, I have the numbers: 28.4773 and -81.337. Immediately, I can tell the latitude is in the Northern Hemisphere and the longitude is in the Western Hemisphere. That puts us somewhere in North America, most likely the United States.

My next move is to figure out the specific state. I can mentally process this directly. Let me see... I'll use my internal, highly optimized, geocoding knowledge, based on my extensive experience. I'll essentially use my mental database and search for those coordinates.

Searching... searching... Yep, that's coming up as Orlando, Florida. Close to the airport. So the state is Florida. The user asked specifically for the state, so I'll give them that.

Now for formatting. The user wants the final answer on a new line.

I'll give them a direct and clear answer first: "The place with latitude 28.4773 and longitude -81.337 is located in Florida." Then, I'll put the state, as requested, on its own line.

The state where the coordinates 28.4773 (latitude) and -81.337 (longitude) are located is Florida.

Florida
