Okay, so the user wants to know the state for a specific latitude and longitude. Let's see, what are the numbers? 35.9692 and -83.9496. Alright, let's break this down. Latitude 35.9692 is north, and longitude -83.9496 is west – looks like somewhere in the US.

My plan is to reverse geocode. I can use any number of tools – Google Maps, a quick search, whatever's handy. Let's just punch those coordinates into a search bar, right?

Okay, search results are saying Knoxville, Tennessee. Specifically, near the University of Tennessee. Good, Tennessee it is.

Now, double-check the bounds. Is that right? Tennessee is roughly between 35 and 36 degrees north, and between -81 and -90 degrees west, and these coordinates fall within that range. Confirmed!

Alright, let's formulate the answer. The user just wants the state, so I'll add a sentence to provide context and then answer the question precisely.

The place with the coordinates latitude 35.9692 and longitude -83.9496 is located in Knoxville, Tennessee.

Tennessee
