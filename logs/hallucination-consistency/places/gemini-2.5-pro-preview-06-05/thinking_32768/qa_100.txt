Okay, the user wants the state for a given latitude and longitude. Let's see... they've provided 47.6671 and -117.433. Right, I need to determine where that is. First, I'll break down the coordinates. North and West, so Northern and Western hemispheres, suggesting a location in the US. The latitude is relatively high for the lower 48, so probably a northern state. I need to employ my internal knowledge base â€“ my model of geographical data. Time for a reverse geocoding lookup. Let's start with some nearby major cities. Seattle is too far west. Portland is too far south. Boise is a bit off, too. Spokane, however... Spokane, Washington! The coordinates align almost perfectly with Spokane. So, I've found it. Therefore... Spokane, Washington. Okay, let's give the final answer in a new line.

Washington
