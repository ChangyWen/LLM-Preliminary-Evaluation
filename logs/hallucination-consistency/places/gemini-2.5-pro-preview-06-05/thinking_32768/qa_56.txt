Okay, the user's asking for the state given some coordinates. The key is to get the state. Latitude and longitude... 32.1541, -110.8787... right. That's a straightforward geocoding problem. First, I gotta look at the numbers. 32.1541 is positive, so thatâ€™s Northern Hemisphere. -110.8787 is negative, meaning Western Hemisphere. That suggests North America, most likely. I'll need a geocoding tool, or I can just use Google Maps; a map search engine will do the trick. Plug in the coordinates, "32.1541, -110.8787".

Okay, done, the search results are back. Looks like Tucson, Arizona. Specifically, near the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. Tucson, a major city, definitely in Arizona. So, the state is Arizona.

Now, how do I format this? The user wants the final answer on a new line. Let's start by stating the obvious and then format it according to the instructions.

The location is in Arizona.

Arizona
