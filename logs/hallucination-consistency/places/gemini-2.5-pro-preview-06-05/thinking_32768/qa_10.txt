Okay, the user's question is straightforward: they want the state for a given latitude and longitude. My expertise in geospatial data analysis kicks in immediately.

First things first, I need to grab the key data: latitude 42.3188 and longitude -71.0852. Now, the plan. This is a classic reverse geocoding problem. I'll use my internal knowledge base and tools to translate these coordinates into a human-readable state. That means taking the lat/lon and figuring out the state they belong to.

Time to execute. I'll feed these coordinates into my geocoding engine. Alright, the positive latitude and negative longitude immediately tell me we're in the Northern and Western Hemispheres, indicating the US. Quick mental check: a longitude of -71 suggests the East Coast. Latitude of 42 aligns with states like Massachusetts, New York, or maybe Michigan. 

Let's get more specific. My internal tools are whirring. Hmm, this feels like it's near Boston. I'll check the known coordinates of Boston, which are roughly 42.36° N, 71.05° W. Bingo! Our coordinates (42.3188, -71.0852) are super close, likely in the Dorchester or Roxbury neighborhoods. This confirms the location. The state is clearly Massachusetts.

Final step: Construct the answer. The user only wants the state. Okay, "The place with latitude 42.3188 and longitude -71.0852 is located in Massachusetts." Then, the answer on a new line, as requested. Let's review... The answer is accurate, succinct, and follows all instructions. Excellent. Ready to send.

Massachusetts
