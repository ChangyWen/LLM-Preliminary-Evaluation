Okay, the user's question is straightforward: they want to know the state given a specific latitude and longitude. Let's see... 29.4632 North and -98.5238 West. That's in the US, definitely. Positive latitude means Northern Hemisphere, negative longitude means Western Hemisphere. Alright, my mental gears are already turning. This feels like somewhere in the southern United States, perhaps the Southwest or South Central region. The longitudes suggest somewhere around Texas, Oklahoma, or maybe further west.

I need to be sure, so I'll fire up my internal geocoding engine â€“ or actually, I'd use a map service in the real world. Let's mentally plug in those coordinates: 29.4632, -98.5238... Okay, the results are in my head. It looks like this is in San Antonio. San Antonio is a major city, and that's in Texas. Bingo.

Texas. Does that fit? Yes, definitely. Texas is large enough to encompass those coordinates. Just to confirm, I'll quickly cross-reference the coordinates of San Antonio with a typical search... yep, my mental mapping is spot-on.

So, the user wants the state. The answer is Texas. I need to format it exactly as requested. Let's make it direct and informative.

The place with latitude 29.4632 and longitude -98.5238 is located in Texas.
Texas
