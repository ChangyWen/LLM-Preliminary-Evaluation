Alright, the user's asking for the state given some latitude and longitude coordinates. Easy. First, I need to grab those coordinates: 32.7935, -96.7667. Right. Now, a quick mental check. Latitude is positive, so Northern Hemisphere. Longitude is negative, meaning Western Hemisphere. That points to the US. Now, to get the state, I'll use my internal geocoding knowledge, the one that's essentially a massive map database. I mentally search for those coordinates...Yep, that puts us in Dallas, Texas. I can visualize the area - Mockingbird Station, US-75. To be absolutely sure, I can cross-reference with known Dallas coordinates - roughly 32.7767° N, 96.7970° W. Close enough. Confirmed, it's in Dallas. And Dallas is in Texas. Now, the user wants the final answer on a new line. Let's make this clear and concise.

The coordinates 32.7935 latitude and -96.7667 longitude fall within the city of Dallas.

Texas
