Okay, so the core question is: *What state is at this latitude and longitude?* Right, that's straightforward. Let me grab those coordinates: 43.0642, -87.9675. Hmm, first glance, that's Northern and Western Hemispheres, placing it somewhere in the US.

Alright, time to find out precisely *where*. I'll use a quick reverse geocoding strategy - mentally, initially, but I'd probably use a mapping service in reality. Let's plug those numbers into a mental map. Okay, I’m visualizing it… that’s looking like Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Specifically, around Miller Park.

Now, verification is key. Is that plausible? Wisconsin’s latitude range would encompass 43.0642, and the longitude range would also work. Yep, the result seems reliable.

Now to construct my response. The user just asked for the *state*. A direct answer is best. Let's provide a little context but stick to the main point.

The best way is to be direct. "The place with latitude 43.0642 and longitude -87.9675 is located in the state of Wisconsin." Then, I need the final answer on a new line as requested.

Wisconsin
