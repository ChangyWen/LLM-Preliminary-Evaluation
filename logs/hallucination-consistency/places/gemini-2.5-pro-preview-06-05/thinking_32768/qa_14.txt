Okay, let's see. The user wants to know the state associated with a specific latitude and longitude. I need to figure out what state those coordinates fall within.

First, I'll grab the data: Latitude 37.7558 and Longitude -122.4449. Right away, I know this is in the Northern and Western Hemispheres, so we're in the United States, specifically on the West Coast. Now to pinpoint the location.

I'll use my mental map. I know that -122 longitude is very specific, right on the Pacific coast. And 37.7 latitude is pretty definitive, as well. I'll quickly run through the nearby major cities in my head: Los Angeles is further south and east, Seattle is too far north and too far east. San Francisco, ah, yes! Around 37.7 and -122.4, which is very close.

I'll confirm that mental check with a more precise tool - it can be my internal knowledge base or a quick search using a geocoding service would work, too. I'll input the coordinates and cross-reference the results, and it should come up with a location in San Francisco, CA. Breaking down the coordinates further, 37.7558 N, -122.4449 W... It's very specific -- seems to be in the Twin Peaks or Cole Valley neighborhood, but San Francisco is what matters. San Francisco is in California.

Now, I'll synthesize the answer. I will start by clarifying the location. The coordinates point to San Francisco, California. And the user asked for the state. The answer is California.

The format requested is important so I'll put the main response at the end, on a new line.

The coordinates 37.7558 latitude and -122.4449 longitude are located in the city of San Francisco.
San Francisco is in the state of California.

California
