Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know the state associated with a specific latitude and longitude. No problem, let's break it down.

First, I need to grab the important numbers: the latitude is 32.8313 and the longitude is -117.1222. Now, let's analyze. Latitude 32.8 degrees North is definitely in the US, somewhere. Longitude of -117 degrees West... that's West Coast, no doubt.

So, how to find the state? I'll tap into my internal knowledge base - my built-in geocoding system, basically. I'll mentally plug those coordinates in: 32.8313, -117.1222, search... Bingo! It's in San Diego, California, near Serra Mesa or Kearny Mesa, if I'm being precise.

The key here is the state: California.

Now to construct the answer exactly as requested. First, a little conversational confirmation, then the answer on a new line. Let's do it.

The place with latitude 32.8313 and longitude -117.1222 is located in California. More specifically, these coordinates point to a location in the city of San Diego.

California
