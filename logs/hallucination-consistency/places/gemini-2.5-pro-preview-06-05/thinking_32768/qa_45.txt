Okay, let's break this down. The user wants the state for a given latitude and longitude. Alright, easy enough. First, I've got to pull out the coordinates: 36.1715, -86.7842. Now, how do I figure this out? I could use a search engine, or maybe my internal mapping knowledge â€“ it's all the same process, really. I'll mentally "search" with those coordinates. Input: `36.1715, -86.7842`. The expected output is a location, which I know is in Nashville.

Analyzing the results, those coordinates definitely put me near downtown Nashville, close to the Cumberland River. Okay, Nashville. And, Nashville is the capital of... Tennessee! That's the key. Gotta verify, though, double-check the general lat/long range for Tennessee to confirm it makes sense. Yup, it's a perfect match.

Now, for the response. The user wants the state name on a new line. I could add some context, like "Nashville, Tennessee," but the *answer* is the state. So, to be direct and concise, I'll say "The place with the coordinates latitude 36.1715 and longitude -86.7842 is located in Nashville, Tennessee." That sets the scene. Then, on a new line, *just* the state. Excellent. This will do the trick.
Tennessee
