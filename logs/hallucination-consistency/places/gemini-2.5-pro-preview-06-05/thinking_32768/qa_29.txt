Okay, so the user needs to know the state for a given latitude and longitude. Let's see, first I need to get the data: Latitude is 37.3012, and longitude is -121.848. Alright, let's analyze this. It's in the Northern and Western hemispheres, which means it's likely in the US. I need a plan now. I'll need a geocoding tool – probably a map service will be the fastest way to go. I'll just pop those coordinates into a search. "37.3012, -121.848". Ah, looks like it's in San Jose, near Kelley Park. San Jose is a major city in California. Now to verify... California's latitude and longitude ranges need to match. Latitude goes from about 32 to 42 degrees north. That checks out. Longitude's from about -114 to -124 west. Yup, that works. Okay, time to craft the response. I'll start by saying that it's located in San Jose, and then I'll give the state directly. Time to put it together: "The coordinates 37.3012, -121.848 fall within the city of San Jose. "… Now, give the final answer, on a new line as requested. Final check: Did I answer it? Yes. Accurate? Yes. Format correct? Yes. All good.

The state is California.
