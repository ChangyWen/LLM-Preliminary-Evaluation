Okay, let's get this done. First, I need to pinpoint the state for those coordinates. Seems pretty straightforward.

Alright, data acquisition time. Latitude: 40.4397. Longitude: -79.9763. Now, let's think through this. 40.4397 North â€“ definitely in the US. West Longitude - that means it's somewhere in the Eastern part of the States, but it's *West* of the Prime Meridian.

Now for the real analysis. I know that area, or at least, I should. I'll use a quick internal geo-lookup. 40.4397, -79.9763... That's... Bingo! It's Pittsburgh. I've handled coordinates in that area before.

The next question is: what state is Pittsburgh in? I *know* this, but let's just run a mental quick check. Pennsylvania! Yep.

To double-check that: Pennsylvania's roughly between 40 and 42 degrees North, and between roughly -80 and -75 West, geographically speaking. Those coordinates definitely fit. They are, in fact, in the southwestern part of the state.

Now, let's formulate an answer. The goal is to be direct and clear. "The location is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania." Fine and concise. The prompt specifically wants the state. Alright, final output time.

The coordinates 40.4397 latitude and -79.9763 longitude are located in the city of Pittsburgh.

Pennsylvania
