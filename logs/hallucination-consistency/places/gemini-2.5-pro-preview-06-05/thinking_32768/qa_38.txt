*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants the state for a given latitude and longitude. Alright, let's see, the coordinates are 35.2083 and -80.8303.  Right, that's North and West, meaning it's in the US somewhere. I'll quickly use a geocoding tool, like a mapping API. I can just pop those numbers into my mental model and get a result, or use a mapping API.  Okay, I've got it - the location is in Charlotte, North Carolina. Let me just double-check that against my knowledge, make sure it's geographically sensible.  Yes, those coordinates fit right into North Carolina's latitude and longitude ranges. The user only asked for the state. Okay, the state is North Carolina. Now to assemble the response perfectly.  They want the answer on a new line. Right. I will start with the information, and then present the formatted answer they requested. The direct answer is better here.

Therefore,

North Carolina
