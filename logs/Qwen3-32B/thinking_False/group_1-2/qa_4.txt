**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether **HILLMAN HOUSES** in Manhattan is located **south of WILLIAMSBURG**, Manhattan, let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the locations**

- **HILLMAN HOUSES** is a public housing complex located in **Manhattan**.
  - It is situated in the **East Harlem** neighborhood, near the intersection of 110th Street and 3rd Avenue.
  - This is in **Upper East Side**, in **Manhattan**.

- **WILLIAMSBURG** is a neighborhood in **Brooklyn**, not Manhattan.
  - It is located across the **East River** from Manhattan.
  - It is **not** a neighborhood within Manhattan.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the relative location**

- Since **HILLMAN HOUSES** is in **Manhattan**, and **WILLIAMSBURG** is in **Brooklyn**, we cannot directly say one is "south of" the other without a shared reference point.
- However, if we consider **geographic direction** from **Manhattan** to **Brooklyn**, **WILLIAMSBURG** is generally **east** of Manhattan, not **south**.
- **HILLMAN HOUSES** is in **Upper East Side**, which is **north** of Central Park.
- So, **HILLMAN HOUSES is not south of WILLIAMSBURG**, because:
  - They are in **different boroughs**.
  - **WILLIAMSBURG is not in Manhattan**, and **HILLMAN HOUSES is not south of it**.

---

### **Step 3: Final determination**

- **HILLMAN HOUSES is in Manhattan**, and **WILLIAMSBURG is in Brooklyn**.
- **WILLIAMSBURG is not in Manhattan**, so the question of whether HILLMAN HOUSES is **south of** it is not valid in a Manhattan-only context.
- If we consider the **geographic location** of the two, **HILLMAN HOUSES is not south of WILLIAMSBURG**.

---

### âœ… **Final Answer: No**.
