**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether **Calcasieu Lake, LA** is located **south of Lake Verret, LA**, let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process using geographic knowledge and logical deduction.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the general locations of both lakes in Louisiana**

- **Calcasieu Lake** is a large brackish lake located in **southwestern Louisiana**, primarily in **Calcasieu Parish**.
- **Lake Verret** is a smaller lake located in **St. James Parish**, which is in **southeastern Louisiana**, near the Mississippi River.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the relative positions (north vs. south)**

- **Calcasieu Lake** is in **southwestern Louisiana**, closer to the **Texas border**.
- **Lake Verret** is in **southeastern Louisiana**, closer to **New Orleans** and the **Mississippi River**.

---

### **Step 3: Use a reference point or map to compare their latitudes**

- **Calcasieu Lake** is approximately at **30.1° N latitude**.
- **Lake Verret** is approximately at **30.4° N latitude**.

Since **latitude increases as you move north**, and **30.1° N is south of 30.4° N**, this confirms that **Calcasieu Lake is south of Lake Verret**.

---

### **Step 4: Final confirmation using a map (conceptual)**

If you were to look at a map of Louisiana:
- **Lake Verret** would appear **north** of the **Mississippi River**.
- **Calcasieu Lake** would appear **southwest** of **Lake Charles**, which is **south** of Lake Verret.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Yes**  
**Calcasieu Lake, LA is located south of Lake Verret, LA.**
