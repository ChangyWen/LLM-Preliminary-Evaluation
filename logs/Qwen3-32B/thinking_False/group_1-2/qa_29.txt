To determine whether **Rara Lake** is located **south of Medina Lake**, let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process:

---

### **Step 1: Identify the locations of Rara Lake and Medina Lake**

- **Rara Lake** is a lake located in **Nepal**, in the **Rukum District** of the Karnali Province. It is the largest lake in Nepal and lies in a remote mountainous region.
  
- **Medina Lake** is not a well-known or widely recognized lake. There are a few possibilities:
  - It could be a **local or man-made lake** in a specific region.
  - It might be a **misspelling** or confusion with another lake (e.g., "Medina" is a city in Saudi Arabia, but there is no major lake there).
  - It could be a **fictional or lesser-known body of water**.

Since there is **no widely recognized or geographically documented "Medina Lake"**, we must consider the possibility that it is either:
  - A **local or obscure lake**, or
  - A **misunderstood or misspelled name**.

---

### **Step 2: Consider possible locations for "Medina Lake"**

If we assume "Medina Lake" is a real lake, we need to determine its location. Since it is not a known geographic feature, we cannot determine its exact coordinates or position relative to Rara Lake.

However, if we consider **Medina, Saudi Arabia**, as a possible reference point (since "Medina" is a well-known city), we can compare the **geographic positions**:

- **Rara Lake** is located in **Nepal**, at approximately **28.7° N, 82.3° E**.
- **Medina (Saudi Arabia)** is located at approximately **24.4° N, 39.6° E**.

---

### **Step 3: Compare the relative positions**

- Rara Lake is in **Nepal**, in the **northern part of South Asia**.
- Medina (Saudi Arabia) is in the **Middle East**, significantly **south and west** of Nepal.

So, if we are comparing **Rara Lake (Nepal)** to **Medina (Saudi Arabia)**, then:

- **Rara Lake is north of Medina**, not south.

---

### **Step 4: Conclusion**

Since:
- There is **no well-known "Medina Lake"** in the world.
- If we assume "Medina Lake" refers to a location near **Medina, Saudi Arabia**, then **Rara Lake is north of it**, not south.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: No**  
**Rara Lake is not located south of Medina Lake.**
