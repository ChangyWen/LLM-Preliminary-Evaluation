To determine whether **Lake Vico** is located **west of Pragser Wildsee**, we need to analyze the geographical positions of both lakes. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### Step 1: Identify the locations of both lakes

- **Pragser Wildsee** is a lake in the **South Tyrol region of Italy**, near the Austrian border. It is located in the **Alto Adige** (German: *Ahrntal*), in the **Dolomites**.  
  - Coordinates: approximately **46.8667° N, 12.3667° E**

- **Lake Vico** (Lago di Vico) is a lake in **central Italy**, in the **Lazio region**, near the town of Vico Equense.  
  - Coordinates: approximately **40.9500° N, 14.1500° E**

---

### Step 2: Compare their relative positions

- **Pragser Wildsee** is in the **northeastern part of Italy**, near the Austrian border.
- **Lake Vico** is in the **central part of Italy**, near Naples.

To determine if Lake Vico is **west of Pragser Wildsee**, we can compare their **longitudes**:

- **Pragser Wildsee**: ~12.3667° E
- **Lake Vico**: ~14.1500° E

Since **14.1500° E is east of 12.3667° E**, **Lake Vico is east of Pragser Wildsee**, not west.

---

### Final Answer:
**No**, Lake Vico is **not** located west of Pragser Wildsee.
