**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Understand the question:**
   - We are comparing the **average lifespan** of a **human** to that of a **dog**.

2. **Define "average lifespan":**
   - This refers to the **mean number of years** an individual of a species typically lives, based on global or general population data.

3. **Find the average human lifespan:**
   - According to global data (World Health Organization, 2023), the **average human lifespan** is approximately **73 years**.

4. **Find the average dog lifespan:**
   - The **average lifespan of a dog** varies by breed and size, but the general average is around **10 to 13 years**.
   - For example:
     - Small dogs (e.g., Chihuahua): up to **15–20 years**
     - Medium dogs: around **12–14 years**
     - Large dogs (e.g., Great Dane): around **8–10 years**
   - A commonly accepted **overall average** is about **12 years**.

5. **Compare the two:**
   - Human average lifespan: **~73 years**
   - Dog average lifespan: **~12 years**

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Since **73 years > 12 years**, the **average human lifespan is longer** than that of a dog.

**Final Answer: Yes**.
