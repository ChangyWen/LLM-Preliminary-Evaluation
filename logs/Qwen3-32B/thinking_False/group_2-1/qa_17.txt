Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether **Earth has more moons than Mars**.

---

### **Step 1: Define what a "moon" is**
A **moon** is a natural satellite that orbits a planet. It is not man-made and is large enough to be gravitationally bound to the planet.

---

### **Step 2: How many moons does Earth have?**
- Earth has **1** confirmed natural satellite.
- This is the **Moon**, which is the fifth-largest moon in the Solar System.

---

### **Step 3: How many moons does Mars have?**
- Mars has **2** confirmed natural satellites.
- These are **Phobos** and **Deimos**, both of which are small, irregularly shaped moons.

---

### **Step 4: Compare the number of moons**
- Earth: **1** moon
- Mars: **2** moons

---

### **Step 5: Conclusion**
Since **1 (Earth) < 2 (Mars)**, **Earth does not have more moons than Mars**.

---

### âœ… **Final Answer: No**.
