**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1. **Identify the species in question:**
   - **Peregrine Falcon** (*Falco peregrinus*)
   - **Eagle** – This is a general term for birds in the family *Accipitridae*, which includes many species such as the **Bald Eagle** (*Haliaeetus leucocephalus*), **Golden Eagle** (*Aquila chrysaetos*), and others.

2. **Understand the context of "faster":**
   - The question is about **speed**, so we are comparing the **maximum speed** each bird can achieve, typically in **flight**.
   - The **Peregrine Falcon** is well known for being the **fastest bird in the world**, particularly in **diving (stooping)**.

3. **Compare the maximum speeds:**
   - **Peregrine Falcon:**
     - In a **diving (stooping) speed**, it can reach **240–260 mph (390–420 km/h)**.
     - In **level flight**, it can reach up to **69–90 mph (110–145 km/h)**.
   - **Eagles (e.g., Golden Eagle or Bald Eagle):**
     - In **level flight**, eagles typically fly at **30–40 mph (48–64 km/h)**.
     - In a **diving speed**, the **Golden Eagle** can reach **150 mph (240 km/h)**, which is **slower** than the peregrine falcon's diving speed.

4. **Conclusion based on the comparison:**
   - The **Peregrine Falcon** is **faster than eagles** in both **level flight** and **diving speed**.
   - Even the fastest eagle (Golden Eagle) is **not as fast** as the peregrine falcon in a dive.

---

**Final Answer: Yes.**  
A peregrine falcon is faster than an eagle.
