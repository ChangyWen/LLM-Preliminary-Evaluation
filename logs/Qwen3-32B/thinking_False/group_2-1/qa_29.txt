**************************************** Content ***************************************
Yes, the wavelength of red light is longer than that of blue light. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the electromagnetic spectrum**
Visible light is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Within this visible range, different colors correspond to different wavelengths of light.

---

### **Step 2: Know the order of visible light colors by wavelength**
In the visible spectrum, the colors are arranged from **longest to shortest wavelength** as follows:

**Red → Orange → Yellow → Green → Blue → Indigo → Violet**

This is often remembered using the acronym **ROYGBIV**.

---

### **Step 3: Compare red and blue light**
- **Red light** has the **longest wavelength** in the visible spectrum.
- **Blue light** has a **shorter wavelength** than red.

---

### **Step 4: Use approximate values for confirmation**
- **Red light**: Wavelengths range from about **620 nm to 750 nm**
- **Blue light**: Wavelengths range from about **450 nm to 495 nm**

Clearly, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Yes**  
The wavelength of red light is longer than that of blue light.
