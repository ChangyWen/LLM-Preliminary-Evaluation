**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1. **Understanding pH:**
   - pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is.
   - The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14.
   - A pH of 7 is neutral (like pure water).
   - A pH less than 7 is acidic.
   - A pH greater than 7 is basic.

2. **pH of Water:**
   - Pure water has a pH of **7**, which is neutral.

3. **pH of Lemon Juice:**
   - Lemon juice is known to be **acidic** due to the presence of **citric acid**.
   - The typical pH of lemon juice is between **2 and 3**.

4. **Comparison:**
   - Since the pH of lemon juice is between 2 and 3, and the pH of water is 7:
     - **2 to 3 < 7**
     - This means lemon juice is **more acidic** than water.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Because lemon juice is more acidic, its pH is **lower** than that of water.

**Final Answer: Yes**.
