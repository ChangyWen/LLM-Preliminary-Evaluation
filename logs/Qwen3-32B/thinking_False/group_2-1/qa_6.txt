Sure! Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether the **Nile River** is longer than the **Yangtze River**.

### **Step 1: Identify the two rivers**
- **Nile River**: Located in northeastern Africa, it flows through several countries including Egypt, Sudan, South Sudan, and others.
- **Yangtze River**: Located in China, it is the longest river in Asia and the third-longest in the world.

---

### **Step 2: Find the lengths of both rivers**

#### **Nile River**
- The **Nile** is traditionally considered the **longest river in the world**.
- Its length is approximately **6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles)**.
- This includes the **White Nile** (the longer tributary) and the **Blue Nile**.

#### **Yangtze River**
- The **Yangtze** is the **longest river in Asia** and the **third-longest in the world**.
- Its length is approximately **6,300 kilometers (3,915 miles)**.

---

### **Step 3: Compare the lengths**
- **Nile River**: ~6,650 km
- **Yangtze River**: ~6,300 km

Since **6,650 km > 6,300 km**, the **Nile River is longer** than the **Yangtze River**.
