**************************************** Content ***************************************
Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether a **blue whale** has a **larger heart** than an **elephant**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**
We are comparing the **size of the heart** in two of the largest land and sea animals:
- **Blue whale** (largest animal on Earth)
- **Elephant** (largest land animal)

We are specifically interested in the **heart size**, not the overall body size.

---

### **Step 2: Gather approximate heart sizes**

#### **Blue Whale Heart**
- The blue whale is the largest animal to have ever lived.
- Its heart can weigh up to **400 kilograms (880 pounds)**.
- The heart is about the size of a **small car**.
- The aorta (main artery) is about **9 inches in diameter**.

#### **Elephant Heart**
- The African bush elephant is the largest land animal.
- Its heart typically weighs between **12 to 21 kilograms (26 to 46 pounds)**.
- The heart is roughly the size of a **large football**.

---

### **Step 3: Compare the two**
- **Blue whale heart**: ~400 kg
- **Elephant heart**: ~12–21 kg

Clearly, the **blue whale's heart is significantly larger** in both **weight** and **volume**.

---

### **Step 4: Consider biological context**
- The blue whale's heart must pump blood through a body that can be over **30 meters (100 feet)** long.
- The elephant's heart, while large for a land animal, serves a much smaller body in comparison.

---

### **Final Answer: Yes**
✅ **Yes**, a **blue whale has a larger heart** than an **elephant**.
