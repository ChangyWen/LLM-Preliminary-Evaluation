**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1. **Understand the question:**
   - The question is asking whether the **speed of light** is **faster** than the **speed of sound**.

2. **Define the two speeds:**
   - **Speed of light**: This is the speed at which electromagnetic waves (including visible light) travel through a vacuum.
   - **Speed of sound**: This is the speed at which sound waves travel through a medium (like air, water, or solids).

3. **Look up the approximate values:**
   - **Speed of light in a vacuum**:  
     $ c = 299,792,458 \, \text{meters per second (m/s)} $  
     (approximately **300,000,000 m/s**)
   - **Speed of sound in air at 20°C (68°F)**:  
     $ v = 343 \, \text{m/s} $

4. **Compare the two values:**
   - $ 299,792,458 \, \text{m/s} $ (speed of light)  
     vs.  
     $ 343 \, \text{m/s} $ (speed of sound in air)

5. **Draw a conclusion:**
   - The speed of light is **much greater** than the speed of sound in air.

**Final Answer: Yes**  
The speed of light is faster than the speed of sound.
