Let's go through a **step-by-step reasoning process** to determine whether the **Sahara Desert** is hotter than the **Gobi Desert**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Deserts**

- **Sahara Desert**:
  - Located in **North Africa**.
  - The **largest hot desert** in the world.
  - Primarily a **tropical desert** with **extremely high temperatures**.
  - Receives **very little rainfall** and is mostly **hot year-round**.

- **Gobi Desert**:
  - Located in **Mongolia and China**.
  - A **cold desert**, meaning it has **cold winters** and **hot summers**.
  - Receives slightly more rainfall than the Sahara but is still arid.
  - Has a **continental climate** with **large temperature variations**.

---

### **Step 2: Compare Average Temperatures**

- **Sahara Desert**:
  - **Summer daytime temperatures** can reach up to **50°C (122°F)**.
  - **Average annual temperature** is around **30°C (86°F)**.
  - It is known for being one of the **hottest places on Earth**.

- **Gobi Desert**:
  - **Summer temperatures** can reach up to **40°C (104°F)**.
  - **Winter temperatures** can drop to **-40°C (-40°F)**.
  - **Average annual temperature** is much lower than the Sahara, around **10°C (50°F)**.

---

### **Step 3: Consider the Climate Type**

- The **Sahara** is a **hot desert climate (BWh)**, with **high temperatures year-round**.
- The **Gobi** is a **cold desert climate (BWk)**, with **hot summers and very cold winters**.

So, while the **Gobi can get very hot in summer**, it is **not as consistently hot** as the Sahara.

---

### **Step 4: Conclusion**

- The **Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert**, especially in terms of **average annual temperature** and **maximum recorded temperatures**.
- The Gobi experiences **extreme cold in winter**, which the Sahara does not.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Yes**  
The **Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert**.
