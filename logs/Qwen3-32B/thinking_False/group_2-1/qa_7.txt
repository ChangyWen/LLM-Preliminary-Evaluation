**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1. **Identify the animals in question:**
   - Cheetah (*Acinonyx jubatus*)
   - Lion (*Panthera leo*)

2. **Understand the key question:**
   - Are cheetahs faster than lions?

3. **Research the top speeds of both animals:**
   - **Cheetah:** The cheetah is the fastest land animal. It can reach **speeds of up to 60–70 mph (97–113 km/h)** in short bursts.
   - **Lion:** Lions are powerful and agile, but not built for high-speed chases. Their top speed is **around 35–50 mph (55–80 km/h)**.

4. **Compare the two:**
   - Cheetahs can reach **higher top speeds** than lions.
   - Lions are not built for speed but for strength and endurance in short bursts.

5. **Consider the purpose of speed:**
   - Cheetahs rely on speed to catch fast prey like gazelles.
   - Lions often rely on ambush, teamwork, and stamina rather than pure speed.

6. **Conclusion based on the comparison:**
   - Since cheetahs can reach higher top speeds than lions, **cheetahs are faster than lions**.

**Final Answer: Yes.**
