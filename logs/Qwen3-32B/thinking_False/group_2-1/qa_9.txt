**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1. **Understand the question:**
   - The question is asking whether **Antarctica is colder than the Arctic**.

2. **Define the regions:**
   - **Antarctica** is a continent located at the South Pole, covered almost entirely by ice and snow.
   - **The Arctic** is a region at the North Pole, primarily an ocean (Arctic Ocean) surrounded by land, also covered in ice and snow.

3. **Compare average temperatures:**
   - **Antarctica:**
     - The coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth was in Antarctica: **-89.2°C (-128.6°F)** at the Soviet Vostok Station in 1983.
     - Average winter temperatures in the interior of Antarctica can be as low as **-60°C (-76°F)**.
     - Even in summer, temperatures rarely rise above **0°C (32°F)** in most areas.
   - **Arctic:**
     - The coldest temperature recorded in the Arctic is around **-68°C (-90°F)**, but this is much rarer.
     - Average winter temperatures in the Arctic range from **-30°C to -40°C (-22°F to -40°F)**.
     - In summer, temperatures can rise to **10°C (50°F)** or higher in some parts of the Arctic.

4. **Consider elevation and geography:**
   - Antarctica is on average **2,000 meters (6,500 feet)** above sea level, and its high elevation contributes to colder temperatures.
   - The Arctic is mostly at or near sea level, which makes it relatively warmer than Antarctica.

5. **Ocean vs. landmass:**
   - The Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land, and the ocean retains more heat than land, which helps moderate temperatures.
   - Antarctica is a landmass surrounded by ocean, and land cools more quickly and intensely than water.

6. **Conclusion from the comparison:**
   - Based on the lowest recorded temperatures, average temperatures, and geographic factors, **Antarctica is significantly colder than the Arctic**.

---

**Final Answer: Yes.**  
Antarctica is colder than the Arctic.
