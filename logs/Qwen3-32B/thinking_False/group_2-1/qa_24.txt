Let's determine whether a **day on Venus lasts longer than a day on Earth**, step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Define what a "day" means**

A **day** can be defined in two ways:

1. **Solar day** – The time it takes for a planet to rotate once relative to the Sun (i.e., from one noon to the next).
2. **Sidereal day** – The time it takes for a planet to rotate once relative to the distant stars.

We'll consider both definitions to be thorough.

---

### **Step 2: Earth's day**

- **Earth's solar day**: ~24 hours
- **Earth's sidereal day**: ~23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds

So, Earth's day is roughly 24 hours.

---

### **Step 3: Venus's day**

Venus has a **very slow rotation** and also **rotates in the opposite direction** to most planets (retrograde rotation).

- **Venus's sidereal day**: ~243 Earth days  
  (This is how long it takes Venus to rotate once on its axis relative to the stars.)

- **Venus's solar day**: ~116.75 Earth days  
  (This is how long it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky on Venus.)

---

### **Step 4: Compare the two**

- **Solar day**:
  - Venus: ~116.75 Earth days
  - Earth: ~1 Earth day
  - ✅ **Venus's solar day is longer than Earth's.**

- **Sidereal day**:
  - Venus: ~243 Earth days
  - Earth: ~0.997 Earth days
  - ✅ **Venus's sidereal day is also longer than Earth's.**

---

### **Final Answer: Yes**

A **day on Venus lasts longer than a day on Earth**, whether you're talking about a **solar day** or a **sidereal day**.
