**************************************** Content ***************************************
Yes, the distance from Earth to the Sun is greater than the distance from Earth to the Moon. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**
We are comparing two distances:
- **Earth to Moon**
- **Earth to Sun**

We want to determine which one is greater.

---

### **Step 2: Recall approximate average distances**

- **Average distance from Earth to Moon**  
  ≈ **384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles)**

- **Average distance from Earth to Sun**  
  ≈ **149.6 million kilometers (93 million miles)**  
  (This is also known as **1 astronomical unit**, or 1 AU)

---

### **Step 3: Compare the two distances**

- Earth to Moon: ~384,400 km  
- Earth to Sun: ~149,600,000 km

Clearly, **149,600,000 km is much greater than 384,400 km**.

---

### **Step 4: Conclusion**

✅ The distance from Earth to the Sun is **much greater** than the distance from Earth to the Moon.

---

### **Final Answer: Yes** ✅
