Let's go through the question step by step:

---

**Question:**  
*Is the melting point of ice lower than the boiling point of water?*

---

### Step 1: Define the melting point of ice  
The **melting point of ice** is the temperature at which solid ice turns into liquid water.  
- At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), the melting point of ice is **0°C (32°F)**.

---

### Step 2: Define the boiling point of water  
The **boiling point of water** is the temperature at which liquid water turns into water vapor (gas).  
- At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), the boiling point of water is **100°C (212°F)**.

---

### Step 3: Compare the two temperatures  
- Melting point of ice: **0°C**  
- Boiling point of water: **100°C**  

Since **0°C is less than 100°C**, the melting point of ice is **lower** than the boiling point of water.

---

### Final Answer:  
**Yes**.
