Let's go through the question step by step:

---

**Question:**  
*Is the boiling point of water higher than the freezing point of water?*

---

### Step 1: Define the boiling point of water  
The **boiling point** of water is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a gas.  
- At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.3 kPa), the boiling point of water is **100°C (212°F)**.

---

### Step 2: Define the freezing point of water  
The **freezing point** of water is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a solid.  
- At standard atmospheric pressure, the freezing point of water is **0°C (32°F)**.

---

### Step 3: Compare the two temperatures  
- Boiling point: **100°C**  
- Freezing point: **0°C**  

Since **100°C is greater than 0°C**, the boiling point is **higher** than the freezing point.

---

### Final Answer:  
**Yes**.
