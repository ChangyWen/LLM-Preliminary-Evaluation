**************************************** Content ***************************************
Sure! Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether the atomic number of oxygen is higher than that of carbon.

---

### **Step 1: Understand what atomic number means**
- The **atomic number** of an element is the number of **protons** in the nucleus of an atom of that element.
- It determines the element's identity and its position in the **periodic table**.

---

### **Step 2: Find the atomic number of carbon**
- Carbon is a chemical element with the symbol **C**.
- Its atomic number is **6**.

---

### **Step 3: Find the atomic number of oxygen**
- Oxygen is a chemical element with the symbol **O**.
- Its atomic number is **8**.

---

### **Step 4: Compare the two atomic numbers**
- Carbon: **6**
- Oxygen: **8**
- Since **8 > 6**, the atomic number of oxygen is **greater** than that of carbon.

---

### âœ… **Final Answer: Yes**  
The atomic number of oxygen is higher than that of carbon.
