**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1. **Understand the question:**  
   The question is asking whether **gold is more expensive than silver**, based on their **market prices**.

2. **Define "expensive" in this context:**  
   In this case, "expensive" refers to the **price per unit weight** (typically per gram or per troy ounce) in the **commodity market**.

3. **Compare the market prices (as of recent data):**  
   - **Gold price (as of April 2025):** Approximately **$2,300 per troy ounce**.  
   - **Silver price (as of April 2025):** Approximately **$28 per troy ounce**.  

   *(Note: These prices are subject to change daily based on market conditions, but the general trend is consistent over time.)*

4. **Convert to a common unit for comparison (if needed):**  
   - 1 troy ounce = 31.1 grams.  
   - Gold: $2,300 / 31.1 ≈ **$74 per gram**.  
   - Silver: $28 / 31.1 ≈ **$0.90 per gram**.

5. **Analyze the comparison:**  
   - Gold is significantly more expensive per gram than silver.  
   - The price difference is consistent with historical trends and is due to factors like rarity, demand, and industrial/commercial uses.

6. **Conclusion:**  
   Based on the price per unit weight, **gold is more expensive than silver**.
