**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1. **Identify the key events:**
   - **Discovery of penicillin:** This refers to the discovery of the antibiotic penicillin.
   - **Discovery of DNA structure:** This refers to the elucidation of the double-helix structure of DNA.

2. **Determine the dates of these discoveries:**
   - **Penicillin:** The discovery of penicillin is credited to **Alexander Fleming** in **1928**. He observed that the mold *Penicillium notatum* produced a substance that inhibited bacterial growth.
   - **DNA structure:** The structure of DNA was discovered by **James Watson and Francis Crick** in **1953**, based on the X-ray diffraction data provided by **Rosalind Franklin** and **Maurice Wilkins**.

3. **Compare the dates:**
   - Penicillin was discovered in **1928**.
   - The DNA structure was discovered in **1953**.
   - Since **1928 is earlier than 1953**, the discovery of penicillin occurred **before** the discovery of the DNA structure.

**Final Answer: Yes**.
