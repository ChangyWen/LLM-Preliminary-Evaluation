**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1. **Identify the time period of the Roman Empire:**
   - The Roman Empire was established in 27 BCE when Augustus became the first Roman emperor.
   - It lasted until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE, while the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) continued until 1453 CE.

2. **Identify the time period of the British Empire:**
   - The British Empire began to take shape in the late 16th century, with the establishment of overseas colonies.
   - It became a major global empire in the 17th and 18th centuries and reached its height in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
   - The empire officially ended in the mid-20th century as most of its colonies gained independence.

3. **Compare the time periods:**
   - The Roman Empire existed from 27 BCE to 476 CE (and continued in the East until 1453 CE).
   - The British Empire began over 1,600 years later, in the late 1500s.
   - Therefore, the Roman Empire existed **long before** the British Empire.

**Final Answer: Yes.**
