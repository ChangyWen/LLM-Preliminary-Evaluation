**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1. **Identify the question:**  
   The question is asking whether the United States has a larger population than Canada.

2. **Understand the subject:**  
   We are comparing the total population of two countries: the United States and Canada.

3. **Gather approximate population data (as of recent estimates):**  
   - **United States:** As of 2024, the estimated population is approximately **339 million**.  
   - **Canada:** As of 2024, the estimated population is approximately **41 million**.

4. **Compare the two numbers:**  
   - 339 million (United States) is significantly greater than 41 million (Canada).

5. **Draw a conclusion based on the comparison:**  
   Since the population of the United States is much larger than that of Canada, the answer is **Yes**.
