To determine whether **Pine Flat Dam, CA** is located **east of St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV**, we need to follow a step-by-step reasoning process based on geography and location data.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the locations**

#### **Pine Flat Dam, CA**
- **Location**: Pine Flat Dam is a dam on the Kings River in Fresno County, California.
- **Coordinates**: Approximately **36.6744° N, 119.3036° W**.

#### **St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV**
- **Location**: This church is located in **St. Mary’s, Nevada**, which is a small community in Elko County, Nevada.
- **Coordinates**: Approximately **39.7167° N, 115.9333° W**.

### **Step 2: Compare the longitudes**

To determine whether one location is **east** of another, we compare their **longitudes**:
- **Pine Flat Dam, CA**: **119.3036° W**
- **St. Mary’s, NV**: **115.9333° W**

Since **115.9333° W** (St. Mary’s) is **west** of **119.3036° W** (Pine Flat Dam), that means **Pine Flat Dam is east of St. Mary’s**.

### **Step 3: Confirm with a general map or direction**

- However, **Pine Flat Dam is in the southern part of California**, and **St. Mary’s is in the northeastern part of Nevada**.
- Despite this, **longitude** is the key factor for east-west direction.
- Since Pine Flat Dam has a **more westerly longitude**, but **less westerly than St. Mary’s**, it is still **east** of St. Mary’s.
