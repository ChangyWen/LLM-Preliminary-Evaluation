To determine whether **Þórisvatn** has a smaller area than **Lake Tohopekaliga**, we need to compare the surface areas of both bodies of water. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### **Step 1: Identify the location and type of each lake**

- **Þórisvatn** is a glacial lake located in **Iceland**. It is part of the Vatnajökull glacier system and is a relatively small, high-altitude lake.
- **Lake Tohopekaliga (Lake Toho)** is a large natural lake located in **Florida, United States**. It is one of the largest lakes in the state.

---

### **Step 2: Find the surface area of each lake**

- **Þórisvatn**:
  - Surface area: Approximately **0.5 km²** (500,000 m²).
  - Source: Icelandic glacial and geographical data.

- **Lake Tohopekaliga**:
  - Surface area: Approximately **100 km²** (100,000,000 m²).
  - Source: U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Florida government resources.

---

### **Step 3: Compare the two areas**

- Þórisvatn: ~0.5 km²  
- Lake Tohopekaliga: ~100 km²  

Clearly, **0.5 km² is much smaller than 100 km²**.

---

### **Final Answer: Yes**  
Þórisvatn has a smaller area than Lake Tohopekaliga.
