**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether **WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan** is located **south of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan**, let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process.

---

### **Step 1: Clarify the locations**

- **Williamsburg, Manhattan** is a neighborhood in **Brooklyn**, not Manhattan. It is located in **Kings County**, and is often mistakenly referred to as being in Manhattan due to its proximity and cultural ties to Manhattan. However, **geographically**, it is in **Brooklyn**.

- **Hillman Houses** is a public housing complex located in **Manhattan**, specifically in the **East Harlem** neighborhood, in **New York County (Manhattan)**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the relative positions**

- **Williamsburg, Brooklyn** is located in **Brooklyn**, which is **east of Manhattan** across the **East River**.

- **Hillman Houses** is in **Manhattan**, in **East Harlem**, which is in the **northern part of Manhattan**.

- **Williamsburg, Brooklyn** is **south of East Harlem** in terms of **latitude**, but it is **across the river**, not directly south in a straight line.

---

### **Step 3: Consider the question's phrasing**

The question asks:

> Is **WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan** located **south of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan**?

This is **geographically incorrect** in two ways:

1. **Williamsburg is not in Manhattan** — it is in **Brooklyn**.
2. **Hillman Houses is in Manhattan**.

So, the question is based on a **mischaracterization of Williamsburg's location**.

---

### **Step 4: Final determination**

- If we **correct the location** and consider **Williamsburg, Brooklyn**, it is **south of Hillman Houses** in terms of **latitude** (Williamsburg is in the **northeastern part of Brooklyn**, Hillman Houses is in the **northern part of Manhattan**), but it is **not directly south** — it is **south and east**.

- However, if we **take the question literally**, and assume the user meant **Williamsburg, Brooklyn**, then the answer is:

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: No**

**WILLIAMSBURG is not in Manhattan**, so it cannot be located **south of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan**.
