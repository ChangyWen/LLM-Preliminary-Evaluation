Let's break this down step by step to determine whether the **Sangre de Cristo Range, CO** is located **east of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Terminology**

- **Sangre de Cristo Range** and **Sangre de Cristo Mountains** refer to the **same geographic feature**.
- The **Sangre de Cristo Mountains** are a major mountain range in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico.
- The term **"Sangre de Cristo Range"** is often used interchangeably with **"Sangre de Cristo Mountains"**.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Question**

You are asking:

> Is **Sangre de Cristo Range, CO** located **east of** **Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO**?

This is essentially asking if a part of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains is located east of the same mountain range â€” which is **not logically possible** unless you're referring to **different parts** of the range.

---

### **Step 3: Consider the Geography**

- The **Sangre de Cristo Mountains** run in a **north-south direction** through **southern Colorado** and into **northern New Mexico**.
- The **eastern side** of the range is in **Colorado**, and the **western side** extends into **New Mexico**.
- So, if you're referring to a **specific part** of the range in Colorado (e.g., the eastern portion), it is **not east of the entire range**, but rather **part of it**.

---

### **Step 4: Clarify the Intent**

If the question is trying to ask whether a **portion** of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Colorado is **east of another portion**, then the answer would depend on the **specific locations** being compared.

But as written, the question is **comparing the same feature to itself**, which is not meaningful.

---

### **Final Answer: No**

The **Sangre de Cristo Range, CO** is **not located east of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO**, because they refer to the **same mountain range**.
