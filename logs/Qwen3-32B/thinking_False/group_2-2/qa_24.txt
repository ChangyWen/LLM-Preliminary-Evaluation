Let's determine whether a **day on Earth lasts longer than a day on Venus** by going through a step-by-step reasoning process.

---

### **Step 1: Define what a "day" means**

A **day** on a planet can be defined in two main ways:

1. **Solar day** – The time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky (e.g., from noon to noon).
2. **Sidereal day** – The time it takes for the planet to complete one full rotation on its axis relative to the distant stars.

We'll consider both definitions to be thorough.

---

### **Step 2: Earth's day**

- **Earth's solar day**: ~24 hours
- **Earth's sidereal day**: ~23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds

So, Earth's **solar day** is 24 hours.

---

### **Step 3: Venus's day**

Venus has a very slow rotation and also rotates **in the opposite direction** to most planets (retrograde rotation).

- **Venus's sidereal day**: ~243 Earth days
- **Venus's solar day**: ~116.75 Earth days

This is a surprising result: because Venus rotates so slowly and in the opposite direction, the **Sun takes less time to return to the same position in the sky** (i.e., a **solar day** is shorter than a **sidereal day**).

---

### **Step 4: Compare the solar days**

- **Earth's solar day**: 24 hours
- **Venus's solar day**: ~116.75 Earth days

So, a **day on Venus (solar day)** is **much longer** than a day on Earth.

---

### **Step 5: Final comparison**

- A **day on Earth** is **24 hours**.
- A **day on Venus** is **~116.75 Earth days**.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: No**

A **day on Earth does NOT last longer than a day on Venus**.  
In fact, a **day on Venus is much longer** than a day on Earth.
