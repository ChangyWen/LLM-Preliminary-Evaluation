Let's go through a **step-by-step reasoning process** to determine whether the **Gobi Desert** is hotter than the **Sahara Desert**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Deserts**

- **Gobi Desert**:
  - Located in northern China and southern Mongolia.
  - A **cold desert**, meaning it has low precipitation and cold winters.
  - Known for its **extreme temperature range** — very hot in summer and extremely cold in winter.

- **Sahara Desert**:
  - Located in North Africa.
  - A **hot desert**, meaning it has high daytime temperatures and low nighttime temperatures.
  - The **largest hot desert** in the world.

---

### **Step 2: Compare Average Temperatures**

- **Gobi Desert**:
  - **Summer temperatures**: Can reach up to **40°C (104°F)**.
  - **Winter temperatures**: Can drop to **-40°C (-40°F)**.
  - **Average annual temperature**: Around **8°C (46°F)**.

- **Sahara Desert**:
  - **Daytime summer temperatures**: Often exceed **50°C (122°F)**.
  - **Nighttime temperatures**: Can drop significantly, sometimes below **0°C (32°F)**.
  - **Average annual temperature**: Around **30°C (86°F)**.

---

### **Step 3: Compare Maximum Temperatures**

- **Gobi Desert**: Maximum recorded temperature is around **49°C (120°F)**.
- **Sahara Desert**: Maximum recorded temperature is **58°C (136°F)** — the **highest recorded temperature in Africa**.

---

### **Step 4: Consider the Type of Desert**

- The **Sahara** is a **hot desert**, so it naturally experiences **higher temperatures** than the **Gobi**, which is a **cold desert**.
- Cold deserts like the Gobi are more influenced by **latitude and elevation**, leading to **colder winters** and **less extreme summer heat** compared to hot deserts.

---

### **Step 5: Conclusion**

- While the Gobi Desert can get **very hot in the summer**, the **Sahara Desert is consistently hotter**, especially in terms of **maximum temperatures** and **average annual temperatures**.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: No**, the **Gobi Desert is not hotter than the Sahara Desert**.
