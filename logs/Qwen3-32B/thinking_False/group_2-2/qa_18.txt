**************************************** Content ***************************************
Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether the distance from Earth to the Moon is greater than the distance from Earth to the Sun.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**
We are comparing two distances:
- **Earth to Moon**
- **Earth to Sun**

We want to know if the **Earth-Moon distance** is **greater than** the **Earth-Sun distance**.

---

### **Step 2: Gather average distances**

- **Average distance from Earth to Moon**  
  ≈ **384,400 kilometers** (or about **238,855 miles**)

- **Average distance from Earth to Sun**  
  ≈ **149.6 million kilometers** (or about **93 million miles**)  
  This is also known as **1 Astronomical Unit (AU)**

---

### **Step 3: Compare the two distances**

- Earth to Moon: ~384,400 km  
- Earth to Sun: ~149,600,000 km

Clearly, **149.6 million kilometers is much greater than 384,400 kilometers**.

---

### **Step 4: Conclusion**

The distance from Earth to the Moon is **not** greater than the distance from Earth to the Sun.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: No**.
