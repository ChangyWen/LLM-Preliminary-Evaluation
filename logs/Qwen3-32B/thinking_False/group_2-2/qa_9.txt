Let's go through a **step-by-step reasoning process** to determine whether the **Arctic is colder than Antarctica**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geography**

- **Arctic**: Refers to the **northern polar region**, primarily an **ocean** (Arctic Ocean) surrounded by landmasses (e.g., parts of Canada, Russia, Greenland, Norway).
- **Antarctica**: Refers to the **southern polar region**, a **continent** surrounded by the Southern Ocean.

This is a key difference: the Arctic is an **ocean surrounded by land**, while Antarctica is a **landmass surrounded by ocean**.

---

### **Step 2: Consider the Climate Differences**

- **Land vs. Ocean**: Land cools more quickly and to lower temperatures than water. Since Antarctica is a **large landmass**, it can get **much colder** than the Arctic, which is an **ocean** with relatively warmer water underneath the ice.
- **Elevation**: Antarctica has a much **higher average elevation** (about 2,500 meters above sea level), which contributes to colder temperatures. The Arctic is at or near sea level.

---

### **Step 3: Look at Temperature Records**

- **Antarctica's coldest recorded temperature**:  
  - **-89.2°C (-128.6°F)** at the **Vostok Station** in 1983.
- **Arctic's coldest recorded temperature**:  
  - **-68°C (-90.4°F)** at **Verkhoyansk, Siberia** (not on the Arctic Ocean itself, but in the Arctic Circle).

So, **Antarctica is colder** in terms of **recorded low temperatures**.

---

### **Step 4: Consider Average Temperatures**

- **Antarctic average winter temperatures**:  
  - Interior: **-60°C to -70°C**  
  - Coastal: **-30°C to -40°C**
- **Arctic average winter temperatures**:  
  - **-30°C to -40°C** in the central Arctic Ocean  
  - Coastal areas: **-40°C to -50°C**, but not as consistently cold as Antarctica.

Again, **Antarctica is colder on average**, especially in the interior.

---

### **Step 5: Conclusion**

Based on:
- Geography (land vs. ocean),
- Elevation,
- Temperature records,
- Average temperatures,

We can conclude:

> ✅ **No**, the **Arctic is not colder than Antarctica**.  
> ❌ **Antarctica is colder than the Arctic.**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **No**.
