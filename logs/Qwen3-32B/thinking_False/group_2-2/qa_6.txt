Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether the **Yangtze River** is longer than the **Nile River**.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the rivers in question**
- **Yangtze River**: The longest river in Asia and the third-longest in the world.
- **Nile River**: The longest river in the world, located in northeastern Africa.

---

### **Step 2: Find the lengths of both rivers**

#### **Nile River**
- The Nile is traditionally considered to be **6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles)** long.
- This length is based on the longest source, the **Congo-Nile River**, which originates in Burundi and flows through several countries before reaching the Mediterranean Sea.

#### **Yangtze River**
- The Yangtze River is approximately **6,300 kilometers (3,900 miles)** long.
- It flows through China from the Tibetan Plateau to the East China Sea.

---

### **Step 3: Compare the lengths**
- **Nile River**: ~6,650 km
- **Yangtze River**: ~6,300 km

Since **6,650 km > 6,300 km**, the **Nile River is longer** than the Yangtze River.

---

### **Final Answer: No**  
The **Yangtze River is not longer than the Nile River**.
