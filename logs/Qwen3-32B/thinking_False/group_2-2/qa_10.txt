Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether **silver is more expensive than gold**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**
The question is asking whether **silver is more expensive than gold**, which implies a **price comparison** between the two metals.

---

### **Step 2: Consider the units of measurement**
To compare the price of silver and gold fairly, we need to use the **same unit of weight**. Typically, the price of precious metals is quoted in **troy ounces**.

- **Gold price**: Usually quoted in **USD per troy ounce**
- **Silver price**: Also quoted in **USD per troy ounce**

---

### **Step 3: Look at current or typical market prices**
As of recent market data (as of 2024â€“2025):

- **Gold**: ~$2,300 per troy ounce
- **Silver**: ~$28 per troy ounce

> These are approximate values and can fluctuate daily based on market conditions.

---

### **Step 4: Compare the prices**
- Gold: ~$2,300 per troy ounce
- Silver: ~$28 per troy ounce

Clearly, **gold is significantly more expensive per troy ounce** than silver.

---

### **Step 5: Consider the quantity needed to compare values**
If we want to know how much silver would be needed to match the price of 1 troy ounce of gold:

$$
\frac{2,300}{28} \approx 82.14 \text{ troy ounces of silver}
$$

So, you would need about **82 troy ounces of silver** to equal the price of **1 troy ounce of gold**.

---

### **Final Answer: No**

**Silver is not more expensive than gold. Gold is significantly more expensive per troy ounce than silver.**
