Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is less than that on the Moon.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**

We are comparing the **acceleration due to gravity** on **Earth** and on the **Moon**.

- The **acceleration due to gravity** is the rate at which an object accelerates toward the center of a celestial body due to its gravitational pull.
- It is denoted by **g** and is measured in **m/s²**.

---

### **Step 2: Recall the formula for gravitational acceleration**

The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of a planet or moon is given by:

$$
g = \frac{G M}{r^2}
$$

Where:
- $ G $ is the gravitational constant,
- $ M $ is the mass of the celestial body,
- $ r $ is the radius of the celestial body.

### **Step 3: Compare Earth and Moon**

Let’s look at the approximate values for Earth and the Moon:

| Property         | Earth              | Moon               |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Mass (kg)        | $5.97 \times 10^{24}$ | $7.35 \times 10^{22}$ |
| Radius (m)       | $6.371 \times 10^6$ | $1.737 \times 10^6$ |
| Surface gravity (g) | $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$ | $1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2$ |

---

### **Step 4: Analyze the values**

- Earth's gravity: **9.81 m/s²**
- Moon's gravity: **1.62 m/s²**

Clearly, the **acceleration due to gravity on Earth is greater** than that on the Moon.

---

### **Step 5: Final Answer**

**No**, the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is **not less than** that on the Moon.  
In fact, it is **much greater**.

✅ **Final Answer: No**.
