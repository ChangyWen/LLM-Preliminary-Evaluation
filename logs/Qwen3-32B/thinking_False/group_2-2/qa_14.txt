Let's go through the question step by step to determine whether an elephant has a larger heart than a blue whale.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**
We are comparing the **size of the heart** in two large animals:
- **Elephant** (land animal)
- **Blue whale** (largest animal on Earth)

We want to know: **Does the elephant have a larger heart than the blue whale?**

---

### **Step 2: Gather approximate heart sizes**

#### **Blue Whale Heart**
- The blue whale is the **largest animal** that has ever lived.
- Its heart can weigh up to **400 kilograms (880 pounds)**.
- The heart is about the size of a **small car**.
- The aorta (main artery) is about **30 cm (12 inches) in diameter**.

#### **Elephant Heart**
- The African bush elephant is the largest land animal.
- An elephant's heart typically weighs about **12 to 15 kilograms (26 to 33 pounds)**.
- It is much smaller than the blue whale's heart.

---

### **Step 3: Compare the two**
- **Blue whale heart**: ~400 kg
- **Elephant heart**: ~12–15 kg

Clearly, the **blue whale's heart is much larger** in both weight and physical size.

---

### **Step 4: Final Answer**
**No**, an elephant does **not** have a larger heart than a blue whale.

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **No**.
