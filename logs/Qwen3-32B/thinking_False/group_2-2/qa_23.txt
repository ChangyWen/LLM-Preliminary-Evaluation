Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether the pH of water is lower than that of lemon juice.

---

### **Step 1: Understand what pH means**
- pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is.
- The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14:
  - A pH of **7** is **neutral** (like pure water).
  - A pH **less than 7** is **acidic**.
  - A pH **greater than 7** is **basic** or **alkaline**.
- The **lower the pH**, the **more acidic** the solution.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the pH of water**
- **Pure water** at 25°C has a pH of **7**, which is **neutral**.
- However, **tap water** or **natural water** can vary slightly due to dissolved minerals or gases, but it's generally close to 7.

---

### **Step 3: Determine the pH of lemon juice**
- Lemon juice is **highly acidic** due to the presence of **citric acid**.
- The pH of lemon juice is typically between **2 and 3**.

---

### **Step 4: Compare the two**
- Water: pH ≈ **7**
- Lemon juice: pH ≈ **2–3**
- Since **2–3 is less than 7**, lemon juice is **more acidic** than water.

---

### **Step 5: Answer the question**
> **Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?**

- **No**, the pH of water is **not lower** than that of lemon juice.
- In fact, **lemon juice has a lower pH** than water, meaning it is **more acidic**.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: No**.
