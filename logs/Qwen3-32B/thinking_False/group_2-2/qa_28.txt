Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether an eagle is faster than a peregrine falcon.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the species in question**
- **Eagle**: There are many species of eagles (e.g., bald eagle, golden eagle). For this comparison, we'll focus on the **golden eagle**, as it is one of the fastest eagles.
- **Peregrine falcon**: A single species of falcon known for being the fastest bird in the world.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the top speeds of each bird**

#### **Golden Eagle**
- **In a dive (stoop)**: Up to **150 mph (240 km/h)**
- **In level flight**: Around **30–35 mph (48–56 km/h)**

#### **Peregrine Falcon**
- **In a dive (stoop)**: Up to **240 mph (390 km/h)** – the fastest speed of any bird
- **In level flight**: Around **30–40 mph (48–64 km/h)**

---

### **Step 3: Compare the speeds**

| Speed Type       | Golden Eagle | Peregrine Falcon |
|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| In a dive        | 150 mph      | 240 mph          |
| In level flight  | 30–35 mph    | 30–40 mph        |

- In a **dive**, the **peregrine falcon is significantly faster**.
- In **level flight**, the two are **very close in speed**, with the peregrine falcon having a slight edge.

---

### **Step 4: Conclusion**

The **peregrine falcon is faster than the eagle**, especially in a dive.

---

### **Final Answer: No**  
An eagle is **not** faster than a peregrine falcon.
