Let's go through the question step by step:

---

**Question:**  
*Is the freezing point of water higher than the boiling point of water?*

---

### Step 1: Define the freezing point of water  
The **freezing point** of water is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a solid (ice).  
- At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.3 kPa), the freezing point of water is **0°C (32°F)**.

---

### Step 2: Define the boiling point of water  
The **boiling point** of water is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a gas (steam).  
- At standard atmospheric pressure, the boiling point of water is **100°C (212°F)**.

---

### Step 3: Compare the two temperatures  
- Freezing point: **0°C**  
- Boiling point: **100°C**

Clearly, **0°C is less than 100°C**.

---

### Step 4: Answer the question  
The question asks: *Is the freezing point of water higher than the boiling point of water?*  
Since **0°C < 100°C**, the freezing point is **not** higher than the boiling point.

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **No**.
