Let's go through the question step by step to determine whether the **speed of sound is faster than the speed of light**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**
We are comparing two physical quantities:
- **Speed of sound**
- **Speed of light**

We want to know which one is faster.

---

### **Step 2: Define the speed of sound**
- The **speed of sound** is the distance traveled per unit time by a sound wave.
- It depends on the **medium** through which it travels (e.g., air, water, steel).
- In **air at 20°C**, the speed of sound is approximately:
  $$
  343 \text{ meters per second (m/s)}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Define the speed of light**
- The **speed of light** is the distance traveled per unit time by electromagnetic waves (like visible light).
- In a **vacuum**, the speed of light is a **universal constant**:
  $$
  299,792,458 \text{ meters per second (m/s)}
  $$
- This is often approximated as:
  $$
  3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s} = 300,000,000 \text{ m/s}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Compare the two speeds**
- Speed of sound in air: **~343 m/s**
- Speed of light in a vacuum: **~300,000,000 m/s**

Clearly:
$$
300,000,000 \text{ m/s} \gg 343 \text{ m/s}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Conclusion**
The **speed of light is much faster** than the **speed of sound**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **No**  
The speed of sound is **not** faster than the speed of light.
