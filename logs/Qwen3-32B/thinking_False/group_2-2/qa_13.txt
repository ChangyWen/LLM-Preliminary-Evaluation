Let's go through a step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether the **Berlin Wall** is longer than the **Great Wall of China**.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the length of the Berlin Wall**

- The **Berlin Wall** was a guarded concrete barrier that divided East and West Berlin during the Cold War.
- It was built in 1961 and demolished in 1989.
- The total length of the Berlin Wall was approximately **155 kilometers (96 miles)**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the length of the Great Wall of China**

- The **Great Wall of China** is a series of fortifications built across the historical northern borders of China.
- The total length of all the sections of the Great Wall (including those built by different dynasties) is approximately **21,196 kilometers (13,171 miles)**.
- This includes both the well-known Ming Dynasty sections and older, less-preserved sections.

---

### **Step 3: Compare the two lengths**

- **Berlin Wall**: ~155 km
- **Great Wall of China**: ~21,196 km

Clearly, the **Great Wall of China is much longer** than the Berlin Wall.

---

### **Final Answer: No**

The **Berlin Wall is not longer** than the **Great Wall of China**.
