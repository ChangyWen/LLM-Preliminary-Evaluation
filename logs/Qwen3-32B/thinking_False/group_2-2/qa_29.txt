**************************************** Content ***************************************
Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether the wavelength of blue light is longer than that of red light.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the electromagnetic spectrum**
Visible light is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The spectrum is arranged in order of increasing wavelength (or decreasing frequency). From **shortest to longest wavelength**, the visible spectrum is:

- **Violet**
- **Blue**
- **Green**
- **Yellow**
- **Orange**
- **Red**

---

### **Step 2: Recall the relationship between color and wavelength**
In the visible spectrum:
- **Blue light** has a **shorter wavelength** and **higher frequency**.
- **Red light** has a **longer wavelength** and **lower frequency**.

This is a key point: **wavelength increases from blue to red**.

---

### **Step 3: Approximate wavelength values**
To confirm this, here are approximate wavelength ranges for blue and red light:

- **Blue light**: ~450–495 nm (nanometers)
- **Red light**: ~620–750 nm

Clearly, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

---

### **Step 4: Final comparison**
Since **blue light has a shorter wavelength** and **red light has a longer wavelength**, the statement:

> "Is the wavelength of blue light longer than that of red light?"

is **false**.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: No**.
