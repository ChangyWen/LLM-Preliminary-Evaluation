Let's go through the question step by step to determine whether a **lion is faster than a cheetah**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**
We are comparing the **top running speeds** of two big cats:
- **Lion**
- **Cheetah**

We want to know which one is **faster**.

---

### **Step 2: Gather factual data on their speeds**

- **Lion (Panthera leo):**
  - Top speed: **35–50 km/h (22–31 mph)**
  - Lions are powerful and built for short bursts of speed, but they are not built for long-distance running.

- **Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus):**
  - Top speed: **80–120 km/h (50–75 mph)**
  - Cheetahs are the **fastest land animals** and are built for speed with lightweight bodies and long legs.

---

### **Step 3: Compare the two**

| Animal   | Top Speed Range       |
|----------|------------------------|
| Lion     | 35–50 km/h             |
| Cheetah  | 80–120 km/h            |

Clearly, the **cheetah is significantly faster** than the lion.

---

### **Step 4: Consider other factors (if relevant)**

- **Endurance vs. Speed:** Lions can run for longer distances than cheetahs, but they are not faster.
- **Hunting style:** Cheetahs rely on speed to chase down prey, while lions often rely on ambush or teamwork.

These factors don't change the fact that **cheetahs are faster**.

---

### **Final Answer: No**

**A lion is not faster than a cheetah.**
