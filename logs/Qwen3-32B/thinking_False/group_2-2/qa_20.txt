**************************************** Content ***************************************
Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether the atomic number of **carbon** is higher than that of **oxygen**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand what atomic number means**
- The **atomic number** of an element is the number of **protons** in the nucleus of an atom of that element.
- It determines the element's identity and its position in the **periodic table**.

---

### **Step 2: Find the atomic number of carbon**
- **Carbon** is the 6th element in the periodic table.
- Therefore, the **atomic number of carbon is 6**.

---

### **Step 3: Find the atomic number of oxygen**
- **Oxygen** is the 8th element in the periodic table.
- Therefore, the **atomic number of oxygen is 8**.

---

### **Step 4: Compare the two atomic numbers**
- Carbon: **6**
- Oxygen: **8**
- Since **6 < 8**, the atomic number of **carbon is not higher** than that of oxygen.

---

### âœ… **Final Answer: No**  
The atomic number of carbon is **not** higher than that of oxygen.
