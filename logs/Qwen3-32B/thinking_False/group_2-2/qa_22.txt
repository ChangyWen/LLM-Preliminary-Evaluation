Let's go through the reasoning step by step to determine whether **Canada is located south of Brazil**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the question**
We are being asked whether **Canada is located south of Brazil**, meaning whether Canada lies **geographically below** Brazil on a map (i.e., has a **lower latitude** than Brazil).

---

### **Step 2: Locate Canada and Brazil on the globe**
- **Canada** is a country in **North America**, located in the **northern hemisphere**.
- **Brazil** is a country in **South America**, also located in the **southern hemisphere**.

---

### **Step 3: Consider the hemispheres**
- The **northern hemisphere** is **north of the equator**.
- The **southern hemisphere** is **south of the equator**.
- Since **Canada is in the northern hemisphere** and **Brazil is in the southern hemisphere**, **Canada is north of Brazil**, not south.

---

### **Step 4: Check approximate latitudes (optional confirmation)**
- Canada's approximate latitude range: **41째N to 83째N**
- Brazil's approximate latitude range: **5째S to 34째S**

This confirms that **Canada is much farther north** than Brazil.

---

### **Final Answer: No**

Canada is **not** located south of Brazil. It is located **north** of Brazil.
