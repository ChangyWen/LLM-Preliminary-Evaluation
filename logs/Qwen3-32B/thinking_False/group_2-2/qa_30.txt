Let's go through the question step by step to determine whether the **average lifespan of a dog is longer than that of a human**.

---

### **Step 1: Define the question clearly**
We are comparing the **average lifespan** of two species:
- **Dogs**
- **Humans**

We are to determine whether the **average lifespan of a dog is longer than that of a human**.

---

### **Step 2: Gather average lifespan data**

#### **Average lifespan of a dog**
- The average lifespan of a dog varies by **breed, size, and health**.
- **Small dogs** (e.g., Chihuahuas, Pomeranians) tend to live longer, often **12–16 years**.
- **Medium dogs** (e.g., Beagles, Border Collies) live around **10–14 years**.
- **Large and giant breeds** (e.g., Great Danes, Mastiffs) have shorter lifespans, often **6–10 years**.
- **Overall global average** for dogs is approximately **10–13 years**.

#### **Average lifespan of a human**
- The **global average human lifespan** is around **73 years** (as of recent data from the World Health Organization).
- In developed countries, it can be **78–82 years** or more.
- In some regions, it may be lower due to health, economic, or environmental factors.

---

### **Step 3: Compare the two averages**
- **Dogs**: ~10–13 years
- **Humans**: ~73 years (global average)

Clearly, **humans live significantly longer on average** than dogs.

---

### **Step 4: Final conclusion**
Since the **average lifespan of a human is longer than that of a dog**, the answer to the question is:

> **No**, the average lifespan of a dog is **not** longer than that of a human.
