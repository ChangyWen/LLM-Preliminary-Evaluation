Okay, so I need to figure out if Pickens, South Carolina is less populous than Arbuckle, California. Let me start by recalling what I know about these places. 

First, I know that South Carolina and California are both U.S. states, but California is much larger and more populous overall. However, individual cities or towns can vary a lot in size. I'm not sure exactly where Pickens, SC is located. I think Pickens is a county in South Carolina, but maybe there's a town or city named Pickens within that county? Similarly, Arbuckle, CA—I don't remember much about that. It might be a small town.

I should check the population of both places. Since I can't look up the exact numbers right now, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge or make educated guesses based on what I know about similar-sized towns in these states. 

For Pickens, SC: If it's a county, the population might be in the tens of thousands. For example, I know that Pickens County, SC has a population around 50,000 to 60,000 people. But if the question is about the town of Pickens within the county, it might be smaller. Let me think—some towns in South Carolina have populations in the few thousand range. For example, if Pickens is a small town, maybe around 2,000 to 5,000 people.

Arbuckle, CA: I'm not as familiar with this. California has many small towns, some with very low populations. For example, places like Bakersfield or Fresno are large, but there are also tiny towns. If Arbuckle is a small town, maybe it's in the hundreds or low thousands. I recall that some California towns have populations under 1,000. For example, I think Arbuckle might be a very small town, perhaps with a population under 1,000.

So if Pickens, SC is a town with around 2,000-5,000 people and Arbuckle, CA is under 1,000, then Pickens would be more populous. But if Pickens is a county with 50,000 and Arbuckle is a town with 1,000, then the county is way bigger. However, the question is about Pickens, SC versus Arbuckle, CA. The key is whether "Pickens, SC" refers to the county or the town. 

Wait, the user wrote "Pickens, SC" and "Arbuckle, CA". In the U.S., when a place is listed as "City, State", it's usually the city or town. So if Pickens is a town in South Carolina, and Arbuckle is a town in California, then I need to compare their populations. 

I think I remember that Arbuckle, CA has a population of around 1,000 or less. For example, according to some sources I've seen before, Arbuckle's population is about 1,000. If Pickens, SC is a town with a population of, say, 2,500, then yes, Pickens would be more populous. But if Pickens is a county, then it's much larger. 

Wait, but the user specified "Pickens, SC" and "Arbuckle, CA". If they are both towns, then the answer depends on their actual populations. Let me try to recall or estimate. 

Another angle: South Carolina's population is about 5 million, California's is 39 million. But that's the entire states. For small towns, the populations can vary. For example, in South Carolina, a town like Pickens might be similar in size to other small towns. Let me think of other towns in South Carolina. For example, Spartanburg has a population of over 40,000, but smaller towns like Anderson might be around 20,000. If Pickens is a small town, maybe 2,000-3,000. 

Arbuckle, CA—I think it's a very small town. Let me try to recall if I've heard of it. Arbuckle is in California's Kern County. I think it's a small agricultural town. Maybe with a population of 500-1,000. 

So if Pickens, SC is around 2,500 and Arbuckle, CA is around 800, then Pickens is more populous. Therefore, the answer would be No, Pickens is not less populous than Arbuckle. Wait, the question is "Is Pickens, SC less populous than Arbuckle, CA?" So if Pickens has a larger population, the answer is No. 

But I need to be careful here. Let me try to verify. If I can't look up exact numbers, I have to rely on estimates. Another way: check if there are any known sources. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau provides population estimates. But since I can't access that now, I'll have to go with my best guess. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of other towns in similar regions. For example, in California, towns like Arbuckle are often very small. In South Carolina, even small towns might have a few thousand residents. So it's plausible that Pickens, SC is larger than Arbuckle, CA. Therefore, the answer would be No, Pickens is not less populous than Arbuckle. 

Wait, but I need to be sure. Let me think again. If Pickens is a county, then it's definitely larger. But the user wrote "Pickens, SC" as a city. So assuming it's a city, then the answer is No. If it's a county, then the answer is also No. Either way, Pickens is more populous. 

Therefore, the answer is No.
