<think>
Okay, so the user is asking if HILLMAN HOUSES in Manhattan is located south of WILLIAMSBURG, also in Manhattan. Let me start by recalling the geography of Manhattan. Manhattan is divided into several neighborhoods, and their locations can sometimes be a bit confusing because the names don't always correspond directly to cardinal directions.

First, I need to figure out where Hillman Houses and Williamsburg are located. I know that Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Wait, but the user specified both are in Manhattan. Hmm, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me double-check. Williamsburg is indeed part of Brooklyn, but sometimes people might refer to areas in Manhattan with similar names. Wait, no, Williamsburg in Manhattan? I don't think there's a neighborhood called Williamsburg in Manhattan. The Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, across the East River from Manhattan. So if the user is saying both are in Manhattan, that might be a mistake. But maybe they meant a different area? Let me think.

Hillman Housesâ€”I'm not as familiar with that name. Let me try to recall. Hillman Houses might be a public housing project. I think there are several public housing complexes in New York City with names like "Hillman Houses." Let me check my memory. I believe Hillman Houses is located in the South Bronx, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's in Manhattan. Wait, the South Bronx is technically part of the Bronx, not Manhattan. So if Hillman Houses is in the South Bronx, then it's in the Bronx, not Manhattan. But the user says it's in Manhattan. Hmm.

Wait, maybe there's a Hillman Houses in Manhattan. Let me think. There's a Hillman Houses in the Bronx, but maybe another one in Manhattan. Alternatively, perhaps the user is mixing up the names. Let me try to visualize a map of Manhattan. If Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, then the area in Manhattan closest to Williamsburg would be the Lower East Side or the East Village. But if Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, where is it? Let me think of other neighborhoods. The South Bronx is in the Bronx, so if Hillman Houses is there, it's not in Manhattan. But if the user says it's in Manhattan, maybe they're referring to a different location.

Alternatively, maybe the user is confused between Manhattan and Brooklyn. If Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, and Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, then the question is whether Manhattan's Hillman Houses is south of Brooklyn's Williamsburg. But since Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, which is south of Manhattan? Wait, no. Brooklyn is to the south of Manhattan? Wait, Manhattan is the northernmost of the five boroughs. So Brooklyn is to the south of Manhattan. So if Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, then it's south of Manhattan. But the user is asking if Hillman Houses (Manhattan) is south of Williamsburg (Manhattan). But if Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, then the question is mixing boroughs. So perhaps the user made a mistake in stating both are in Manhattan. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a neighborhood in Manhattan called Williamsburg. Let me check. No, Williamsburg is definitely in Brooklyn. So the user might have made an error in the question. But assuming that both are in Manhattan, perhaps the user is referring to a different Williamsburg in Manhattan. But I don't think such a neighborhood exists. 

So, if Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, and Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, then the question is whether a Manhattan location is south of a Brooklyn location. But since Brooklyn is south of Manhattan, any place in Manhattan would be north of Williamsburg (Brooklyn). Therefore, Hillman Houses in Manhattan would be north of Williamsburg (Brooklyn), not south. 

But the user is asking if Hillman Houses (Manhattan) is south of Williamsburg (Manhattan). If Williamsburg is in Manhattan, but I don't think that's the case. So perhaps the user is confused. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different Williamsburg in Manhattan. Let me think. There's a neighborhood called Williamsburg in Manhattan? No, I don't think so. The Williamsburg is in Brooklyn. So the user might have mixed up the names. 

Assuming that the user intended to ask about Williamsburg in Brooklyn, then the answer would be no, because Hillman Houses in Manhattan is north of Williamsburg (Brooklyn). But if the user is referring to a different Williamsburg in Manhattan, which I don't think exists, then the answer would depend on the actual locations. 

But given the information, I think the user made a mistake in stating that Williamsburg is in Manhattan. Therefore, the correct answer is that Hillman Houses in Manhattan is not south of Williamsburg (Brooklyn), but rather north of it. Therefore, the answer is No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Clarify the Locations:**
   - **Williamsburg** is a well-known neighborhood in **Brooklyn**, not Manhattan. It is located across the East River from Manhattan.
   - **Hillman Houses** is a public housing complex in the **South Bronx**, which is part of the Bronx borough, not Manhattan. However, the user specified both locations as being in Manhattan, which introduces a potential confusion.

2. **Address the User's Assumption:**
   - The user assumes both locations are in Manhattan. However, **Williamsburg is in Brooklyn**, and **Hillman Houses is in the Bronx**. If we strictly follow the user's statement (both in Manhattan), there is no neighborhood named Williamsburg in Manhattan. This suggests a possible error in the user's question.

3. **Geographic Context:**
   - If we consider **Williamsburg (Brooklyn)** and **Hillman Houses (Bronx)**, the Bronx is north of Manhattan, and Brooklyn is south of Manhattan. Thus, Hillman Houses (Bronx) is **north** of Williamsburg (Brooklyn), not south.

4. **Conclusion Based on User's Query:**
   - If the user intended to ask whether a Manhattan location (e.g., Hillman Houses) is south of Williamsburg (Brooklyn), the answer is **No**, because Manhattan is north of Brooklyn.
   - If the user mistakenly referred to a non-existent Williamsburg in Manhattan, the question is invalid as Williamsburg does not exist in Manhattan.

**Final Answer:**  
No.
