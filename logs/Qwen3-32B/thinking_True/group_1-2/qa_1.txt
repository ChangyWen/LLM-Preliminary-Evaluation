Okay, so I need to figure out if Mo Hayder's "Birdman" is shorter than Peter Hitchens's "The Abolition of Britain." Let me start by recalling what I know about these books. 

First, I should check the page counts for both books. I don't remember the exact numbers off the top of my head, so I might need to look them up. But since I can't actually access the internet right now, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge or make educated guesses based on the authors and the genres.

Mo Hayder is a crime fiction writer, and "Birdman" is one of her novels. Crime fiction books can vary in length, but they often range from 300 to 500 pages. I think "Birdman" might be on the shorter side for a crime novel, maybe around 300-400 pages. I'm not entirely sure, but I'll go with that for now.

On the other hand, Peter Hitchens is a political commentator and author. "The Abolition of Britain" is a non-fiction book, likely a political or historical analysis. Non-fiction books, especially those dealing with complex topics, can be quite lengthy. I recall that some of his works are around 400-500 pages. If "The Abolition of Britain" is similar, it might be in that range. But I'm not certain. 

Wait, another thought: sometimes non-fiction books can be shorter if they're more concise or focused on a specific topic. However, given the title "The Abolition of Britain," which sounds like a comprehensive critique or analysis, it might be a longer work. Let me try to remember if I've heard of the page count for this one. I think I've heard that it's around 400 pages. 

Comparing that to "Birdman," if it's around 300-400 pages, then "Birdman" could be shorter or about the same. But I need to be precise. Let me think again. Mo Hayder's books are typically in the 300-400 page range. For example, her book "The Devil’s Cistern" is 368 pages. "Birdman" might be similar. 

As for "The Abolition of Britain," if it's a non-fiction book by Peter Hitchens, maybe it's around 400 pages. If "Birdman" is 350 pages, then yes, it's shorter. But if "The Abolition of Britain" is only 300 pages, then "Birdman" might be longer. 

Wait, I should check if there are different editions. Sometimes page counts can vary between hardcover and paperback. But generally, the page count is a standard number. Let me try to recall specific editions. 

I think "The Abolition of Britain" was published in 2005. A quick search in my memory: I believe it's around 400 pages. For example, the hardcover edition might be 400 pages. If "Birdman" is 350 pages, then the answer would be yes. 

Alternatively, if "Birdman" is 400 pages and "The Abolition of Britain" is 400 pages, then they're the same. But I think "Birdman" is shorter. 

Another angle: the genres. Crime novels often have a standard length, while non-fiction can vary. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider the authors' other works. Peter Hitchens has written other books like "The Rage Against God," which is 320 pages. So maybe "The Abolition of Britain" is similar or longer. 

Mo Hayder's "Birdman" is a psychological thriller, which might be a bit shorter than a traditional crime novel. I think it's around 300 pages. If that's the case, then yes, it's shorter than 400 pages. 

Putting it all together: If "Birdman" is approximately 300-350 pages and "The Abolition of Britain" is around 400 pages, then the answer is yes. However, if "The Abolition of Britain" is only 300 pages, then no. But based on my current knowledge, I'm leaning towards "Birdman" being shorter.
