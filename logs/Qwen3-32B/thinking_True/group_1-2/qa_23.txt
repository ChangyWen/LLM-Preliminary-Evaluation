Okay, so I need to figure out if St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church in Nevada is located east of Pine Flat Dam in California. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

First, I should confirm the locations of both places. St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church is in Nevada. I need to find out where exactly in Nevada it is. Maybe it's in a specific city or area. Then, Pine Flat Dam is in California. I should check where in California that dam is located. Once I have both locations, I can determine their relative positions to see if Nevada's church is east of California's dam.

Let me start with St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church. I'll try to recall if I know any towns in Nevada with that name or nearby. Alternatively, maybe I can think of major cities in Nevada and see if there's a church with that name. Wait, I think there's a St. Mary's Catholic Church in a place called St. Mary's, which might be in Nevada. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe it's in a different part of Nevada. If I can't remember, I might need to look it up, but since I can't access external resources, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge.

Pine Flat Dam is in California. I know that California has several dams, and Pine Flat Dam is one of them. I think it's located in the Central Valley area, maybe near Fresno or somewhere in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Let me think. The dam is on the Kings River, I believe. So the Kings River flows through California, and the dam is on that river. If I can figure out the approximate location of the dam, I can compare it to the church's location.

Now, Nevada is to the east of California. So if the church is in western Nevada, it might be east of the dam in California. But if the church is in eastern Nevada, then it's further east, but the dam is in California, which is west of Nevada. Wait, the question is whether the church in Nevada is east of the dam in California. So if the church is in western Nevada, near the California border, and the dam is in California, then depending on their exact positions, the church could be east of the dam. But if the church is further east in Nevada, like in Las Vegas or Reno, then it's definitely east of the dam in California.

Wait, but Nevada is east of California. So any location in Nevada is east of any location in California. But that's not entirely accurate because California and Nevada share a border. The western part of Nevada is adjacent to California. So if the church is in western Nevada, near the California border, and the dam is in California, then the church would be east of the dam. But if the dam is in eastern California, like near the Nevada border, then the church in western Nevada might be east of it. But I need to know the exact locations.

Let me try to recall. Pine Flat Dam is in Fresno County, California. The Kings River flows through the Central Valley, and the dam is on the Kings River. So the dam is in the southern part of the Central Valley, near the city of Fresno. Now, if the church is in western Nevada, say near the California border, like in the area of the Spring Mountains or near Las Vegas, then it's east of the dam. But if the church is in a different part of Nevada, like in the east, then it's even further east.

Wait, but the church's name is "St. Mary’s in the Mountains," which might suggest it's in a mountainous area. Nevada has several mountain ranges, like the Sierra Nevada on the eastern edge of California, but the main mountain ranges in Nevada are the Spring Mountains, the Sierra Nevada (which is actually in California and Nevada), and others. If the church is in the Sierra Nevada range in Nevada, that's near the California border. Alternatively, maybe it's in a different mountain range.

Alternatively, maybe the church is in a town called St. Mary's. Let me think. There's a St. Mary's in Nevada? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's in a place like Pioche or another small town. Alternatively, maybe it's in the area of the Spring Mountains near Las Vegas. If the church is in Las Vegas, which is in Clark County, Nevada, then it's definitely east of Pine Flat Dam in California. But if the church is in a different part of Nevada, like in the east, then it's even further east.

Wait, but the key is to determine if the church in Nevada is east of the dam in California. Since Nevada is east of California, any location in Nevada is east of any location in California. However, this isn't entirely correct because the two states share a border. For example, if the church is in the westernmost part of Nevada, near the California border, and the dam is in the easternmost part of California, near the Nevada border, then the church could be east of the dam. But if the dam is further west in California, then the church in western Nevada would still be east of it.

But I need to know the exact locations. Let me try to recall. Pine Flat Dam is in Fresno County, California, on the Kings River. The coordinates of Pine Flat Dam are approximately 36.67° N, 119.43° W. Now, Nevada's western border is around 114.04° W to 119.04° W longitude. Wait, no, Nevada's western border is along the Sierra Nevada range, which is around 119° W longitude. So the western part of Nevada is near 119° W, which is the same longitude as the eastern part of California. So if the church is in western Nevada, near 119° W, and the dam is in California at 119.43° W, then the church is east of the dam. Because 119° W is east of 119.43° W. Wait, longitude decreases as you go east. So a location with a lower longitude (e.g., 119° W) is east of a location with a higher longitude (e.g., 119.43° W). So if the church is in western Nevada at, say, 119° W, and the dam is at 119.43° W in California, then the church is east of the dam.

But I need to confirm the exact longitude of St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church. If I can't find that, maybe I can think of a town in Nevada that's known for that church. Alternatively, maybe the church is in a place like Pioche, Nevada, which is in Lincoln County. Pioche is at around 114.5° W longitude, which is much further east in Nevada. In that case, it's definitely east of the dam in California. But if the church is in a western Nevada town like Pahrump, which is near the California border, at around 115.5° W, then it's still east of the dam in California (which is at 119.43° W). Wait, no, 115.5° W is east of 119.43° W. So any location in Nevada is east of the dam in California because Nevada is east of California. Wait, but that can't be right. Because Nevada is to the east of California, so any point in Nevada is east of any point in California. But that's not true because the two states share a border. For example, a point in western Nevada (near the California border) is adjacent to a point in eastern California. So if the church is in western Nevada and the dam is in eastern California, then the church is east of the dam. But if the dam is in western California, then the church in western Nevada is still east of it. Wait, but longitude-wise, Nevada is east of California. So any location in Nevada is east of any location in California. Therefore, the answer would be yes. But I need to be careful here.

Wait, let's think about coordinates. Let's take an example. Suppose the church is in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is at approximately 115.14° W longitude. The dam is in California at 119.43° W. Since 115.14° W is east of 119.43° W, the church is east of the dam. Similarly, if the church is in Pioche, Nevada (114.5° W), it's even further east. If the church is in a town like Tonopah, Nevada (117.0° W), it's still east of the dam's 119.43° W. Therefore, regardless of where in Nevada the church is, it's east of the dam in California. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, I need to confirm that the church is indeed in Nevada. The user says "St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV," so the church is in Nevada. Therefore, regardless of where in Nevada, it's east of the dam in California. Therefore, the answer is yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Locations:**
   - **St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church** is located in **Nevada (NV)**.
   - **Pine Flat Dam** is located in **California (CA)**, specifically in **Fresno County** on the **Kings River**.

2. **Geographic Context:**
   - Nevada lies **east of California**, with the two states sharing a border along the **Sierra Nevada mountain range**.
   - Longitudes help determine east-west positioning. Lower longitude values (e.g., 114° W) are **east** of higher values (e.g., 119° W).

3. **Coordinate Analysis:**
   - **Pine Flat Dam** is at approximately **36.67° N, 119.43° W** (California).
   - Nevada’s westernmost longitude is around **114.04° W to 119.04° W**. Even the westernmost towns in Nevada (e.g., Pahrump at ~115.5° W) are **east** of Pine Flat Dam’s longitude (119.43° W).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since **all of Nevada** is east of **all of California**, and the church is explicitly in Nevada, it is **east of Pine Flat Dam** regardless of its specific location within Nevada.

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes.**
