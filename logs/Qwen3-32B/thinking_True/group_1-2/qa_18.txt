Okay, so I need to figure out if Cattaraugus County in New York is located west of Cambria County in Pennsylvania. Let me start by recalling the general geography of New York and Pennsylvania. 

First, I know that New York is to the north of Pennsylvania. Both states are in the northeastern United States. Now, Cattaraugus County is in western New York. I remember that western New York is near the Niagara Falls area and borders New York with Pennsylvania and Lake Erie. So Cattaraugus County is probably near the Pennsylvania border.

Cambria County, Pennsylvania, I'm less familiar with. I think Pennsylvania's western part is near Ohio and maybe Lake Erie as well. Let me think. Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania, and Cambria County might be near there. Wait, Cambria County is actually in the central part of Pennsylvania, maybe around Johnstown? I'm not sure. Let me try to visualize a map. If I imagine Pennsylvania, the western part is near Ohio, and the northern part is near New York. So if Cattaraugus County is in western New York, near the PA border, and Cambria County is in central or western PA, then maybe Cattaraugus is west of Cambria?

Wait, but direction matters. If Cattaraugus is in western NY, which is to the north of PA, then if Cambria is in central PA, then Cattaraugus would be both west and north of Cambria. But the question is specifically about west. So even if it's north, if it's west, then the answer is yes. But I need to confirm the exact positions.

Let me think of specific cities. Cattaraugus County includes cities like Little Valley and Salamanca. Cambria County includes Johnstown. If I look up a map, Cattaraugus County is in the extreme western part of New York, bordering Pennsylvania and Lake Erie. Cambria County is in the central part of Pennsylvania, maybe around the middle. So if I imagine a line from west to east, Cattaraugus is further west in New York, and Cambria is more central in PA. So yes, Cattaraugus would be west of Cambria. But wait, since New York is north of Pennsylvania, maybe the longitude is different. Let me think about coordinates. 

New York's westernmost point is near Lake Erie, so Cattaraugus County is in that area. Pennsylvania's western part is near Ohio, but Cambria County is more central. So if I consider the longitude, Cattaraugus County in NY would have a more western longitude than Cambria County in PA. Therefore, yes, Cattaraugus is west of Cambria. 

But I should double-check. Maybe I can recall that Erie County, NY (which is next to Cattaraugus) is near Buffalo, and that's in western NY. Cambria County is in PA, so if I imagine a map, moving from Buffalo, NY (Cattaraugus area) to Johnstown, PA (Cambria), you'd have to go southeast. So that would mean Cattaraugus is northwest of Cambria. Therefore, it's both west and north. But the question is only about west. So yes, it's west. So the answer is yes.
