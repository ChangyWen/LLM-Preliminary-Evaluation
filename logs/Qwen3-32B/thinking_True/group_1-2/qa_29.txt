Okay, so I need to figure out if Rara Lake is located south of Medina Lake. Let me start by recalling what I know about these lakes. First, I'm not sure where either of these lakes are located. I know that there are several lakes named Rara in different parts of the world. For example, there's a Rara Lake in Nepal, which is the largest lake in the country. Then there's also a Rara Lake in the Philippines, part of the Rizal province. But I'm not sure about Medina Lake. Maybe it's in the same region as one of these Rara Lakes?

Wait, Medina Lake could be a different name. Let me think. There's a Medina Lake in Texas, USA. I remember that because there's a Medina River that flows through Texas, and the lake is part of that river system. So if Rara Lake is in Nepal, then it's definitely not in the same region as Medina Lake in Texas. But if there's another Rara Lake somewhere else, maybe in the same country as Medina Lake?

Alternatively, maybe both lakes are in the same country. Let me check. If Medina Lake is in Texas, then Rara Lake in the Philippines would be in a different country. But if there's a Rara Lake in Texas, then maybe they are both in Texas. Wait, I don't think there's a Rara Lake in Texas. Let me confirm that. A quick search in my mind: Rara Lake in Texas? No, I don't recall that. The main Rara Lake I know is in Nepal. So if that's the case, then Rara Lake in Nepal is in Asia, and Medina Lake in Texas is in North America. So they are in different continents. Therefore, the question of whether Rara Lake is south of Medina Lake would depend on their latitudes.

But I need to get the exact locations. Let me think about the coordinates. Nepal is in the southern part of Asia, but it's in the Himalayas, so it's in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The capital of Nepal is Kathmandu, which is around 27.7° N latitude. Medina Lake in Texas is in the United States, which is in the northern hemisphere as well. Texas is around 31° N to 36° N latitude. So if Rara Lake in Nepal is around 27° N, and Medina Lake in Texas is around 31° N, then Rara Lake would be south of Medina Lake. Wait, but I need to check the exact coordinates of both lakes.

Let me try to recall. Rara Lake in Nepal is located in the Mugu District, which is in the far-western region of Nepal. The approximate coordinates for Rara Lake are around 29.7° N, 81.6° E. Medina Lake in Texas is part of the Medina River, and the lake is located in the central part of Texas. The coordinates for Medina Lake are approximately 29.7° N, 98.2° E. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, longitude for Texas would be in the western hemisphere, so it should be 98.2° W, not E. So Rara Lake is at 29.7° N, 81.6° E, and Medina Lake is at 29.7° N, 98.2° W. So both are at the same latitude, 29.7° N. Therefore, they are on the same latitude line. So Rara Lake is not south of Medina Lake; they are at the same latitude. But wait, that seems odd. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the coordinates. Let me think again. Rara Lake in Nepal is in the Himalayas, so it's in the northern part of Nepal. Wait, no, actually, Rara Lake is in the Mugu District, which is in the far-western part of Nepal, but the latitude is around 29.7° N. Medina Lake in Texas is in the central part of Texas, which is around 30° N to 31° N. Wait, if Rara Lake is at 29.7° N and Medina Lake is at 30° N, then Rara Lake is slightly south of Medina Lake. But I need to confirm the exact coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the names. Let me think of other possibilities. Is there a Rara Lake in the United States? I don't think so. The main Rara Lake is in Nepal. So if that's the case, then Rara Lake in Nepal is at 29.7° N, and Medina Lake in Texas is at around 30° N. Therefore, Rara Lake is slightly south of Medina Lake. But wait, the longitude difference is huge. Rara Lake is in the eastern hemisphere (81.6° E), and Medina Lake is in the western hemisphere (98.2° W). So they are on opposite sides of the globe. But latitude-wise, Rara Lake is at 29.7° N, and Medina Lake is at 30° N. So Rara Lake is about 0.3 degrees south of Medina Lake. Therefore, the answer would be Yes, Rara Lake is south of Medina Lake.

But wait, I need to make sure that the coordinates I'm using are correct. Let me try to recall or think of another way. If I imagine a map, Nepal is in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, so its latitude is around 27° N to 30° N. Texas is in the southern part of the United States, so its latitude is around 26° N to 36° N. So if Rara Lake is in the northern part of Nepal, maybe around 30° N, and Medina Lake is in the central part of Texas, maybe around 31° N, then Rara Lake would be south of Medina Lake. But if Rara Lake is in the southern part of Nepal, maybe around 27° N, and Medina Lake is in the southern part of Texas, around 26° N, then Rara Lake would be north of Medina Lake. So this depends on the exact locations.

Alternatively, maybe I should look up the exact coordinates. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my memory. Let me try to recall. Rara Lake in Nepal is the largest lake in the country, located in the Mugu District. The approximate coordinates are 29.7° N, 81.6° E. Medina Lake in Texas is part of the Medina River, and the lake is located in the central part of Texas. The coordinates for Medina Lake are approximately 30.0° N, 98.2° W. So comparing these two, Rara Lake is at 29.7° N, and Medina Lake is at 30.0° N. Therefore, Rara Lake is 0.3 degrees south of Medina Lake. So the answer would be Yes, Rara Lake is south of Medina Lake.

But wait, another thought: if both lakes are in the same country, maybe in the same region, then the answer could be different. But I don't think there's a Rara Lake in Texas. The main Rara Lake is in Nepal. So unless there's another Rara Lake in the same region as Medina Lake, which I don't know of, the answer would be based on the Nepal and Texas locations. Therefore, the answer is Yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether **Rara Lake is located south of Medina Lake**, we need to analyze the geographic coordinates of both lakes.

---

### Step 1: Identify the Locations of the Lakes

- **Rara Lake** is the largest natural lake in **Nepal**, located in the **Mugu District** in the far-western region of the country.
- **Medina Lake** is a reservoir in **Texas, USA**, formed by the damming of the **Medina River**.

---

### Step 2: Determine the Approximate Coordinates

- **Rara Lake (Nepal)**: Approximately **29.7° N, 81.6° E**
- **Medina Lake (Texas, USA)**: Approximately **30.0° N, 98.2° W**

---

### Step 3: Compare the Latitudes

- Latitude is the key factor in determining whether one location is north or south of another.
- Rara Lake is at **29.7° N**, while Medina Lake is at **30.0° N**.
- This means **Rara Lake is 0.3 degrees south** of Medina Lake in terms of latitude.

---

### Step 4: Consider the Longitudes

- Rara Lake is in the **eastern hemisphere** (81.6° E), while Medina Lake is in the **western hemisphere** (98.2° W).
- Although they are on opposite sides of the globe, the question is only about **north-south positioning**, so longitude is not relevant to the final answer.

---

### Final Answer

**Yes**, Rara Lake is located **south of Medina Lake**.
