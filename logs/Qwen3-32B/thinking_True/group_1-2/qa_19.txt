Okay, so I need to figure out if Platte County, Missouri is more populous than Eau Claire County, Wisconsin. Let me start by recalling what I know about these places. 

First, I know that Missouri and Wisconsin are both states in the U.S., but I'm not sure about the population sizes of these specific counties. I think Platte County, MO might be in the St. Louis area? Wait, no, St. Louis is in St. Louis County. Maybe Platte County is near Kansas City? I remember that Kansas City is in Missouri, and there's a Platte County there. If that's the case, then Platte County might be part of the Kansas City metropolitan area, which is a larger region, so the county could have a significant population.

On the other hand, Eau Claire County, WI. Eau Claire is a city in Wisconsin, and I think it's in the northern part of the state, maybe near the Minnesota border. I'm not sure about the population size there. I know that Wisconsin's population is around 5.8 million, but that's the state. Eau Claire is probably a smaller city compared to Kansas City. So maybe Eau Claire County has a smaller population than Platte County.

But I need to check the actual numbers. Let me try to remember or think of sources. The U.S. Census Bureau provides population data. I can look up the latest estimates. Let me try to recall approximate numbers. 

For Platte County, MO: I think it's one of the fastest-growing counties in Missouri. Maybe around 200,000 to 300,000 people? I remember that the 2020 Census might have data. Let me think, maybe around 250,000? 

For Eau Claire County, WI: The city of Eau Claire has a population of about 68,000, but the county would include surrounding areas. So maybe the county is around 100,000 to 150,000? 

Wait, but I should be more precise. Let me try to recall specific numbers. I think in the 2020 Census, Platte County, MO had a population of approximately 237,000. Eau Claire County, WI was around 105,000. If that's the case, then yes, Platte County is more populous. 

But I need to make sure I'm not mixing up the numbers. Let me cross-check. Another way is to think about the cities. Kansas City is a major city, and Platte County is part of the metro area. Eau Claire is a smaller city. So the county populations would reflect that. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of other counties for comparison. For example, if I know that Jackson County, MO (which includes Kansas City) is much larger, but Platte County is a neighboring county. If Platte County is growing, maybe it's catching up. 

Wait, I think the 2020 Census numbers for Platte County, MO were 237,000, and Eau Claire County, WI was 105,000. So yes, Platte County is more populous. 

But I should also consider if there's any recent growth. For example, if Eau Claire County has had a surge in population recently, but I don't recall that. Platte County is part of the Kansas City area, which is expanding, so it's likely that Platte County's population is higher. 

Therefore, based on the 2020 Census data, Platte County, MO has a larger population than Eau Claire County, WI. The answer should be Yes.
