Okay, so I need to figure out if the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan in Wisconsin is located west of The Ort Institute in Illinois. Hmm, let's start by recalling the locations of these two places.

First, the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. I know that Wisconsin is a state in the northern part of the United States, bordering the Great Lakes. Sheboygan is a city in eastern Wisconsin, right? I think it's on the eastern side of the state, maybe near the Lake Michigan coast. So Sheboygan is in the eastern part of Wisconsin.

Now, The Ort Institute is in Illinois. Illinois is to the east of Wisconsin, right? Wait, no, actually, Illinois is to the south of Wisconsin. Let me correct that. Wisconsin is north of Illinois. So if I imagine a map, Wisconsin is up north, and Illinois is to the south of it. But the question is about east-west positioning. Wait, the user is asking if the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is west of The Ort Institute in Illinois. So I need to compare their longitudes.

Sheboygan, Wisconsin is in the eastern part of Wisconsin. Let me think about the longitude. Wisconsin's eastern border is along the Lake Michigan, so Sheboygan is on the eastern side of Wisconsin, which would be closer to the longitude of around 87 degrees west or so. Illinois is to the south of Wisconsin, but also, Illinois is east of the Mississippi River. The Ort Institute is in Illinois. Let me check the longitude of Illinois. Illinois is generally between about 87 degrees west and 89 degrees west longitude. So if Sheboygan is in eastern Wisconsin, maybe around 88 degrees west, and the Ort Institute in Illinois could be in the western part of Illinois, which would be around 89-90 degrees west. Wait, no, that might not be right. Wait, the western part of Illinois is near the Mississippi River, which is around 90 degrees west. So if the Ort Institute is in Illinois, depending on where exactly it is, but if it's in the western part of Illinois, it would be west of Sheboygan. But if it's in the eastern part of Illinois, it would be east of Sheboygan.

Wait, but the question is whether the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is west of The Ort Institute in Illinois. So if the Ort Institute is in Illinois, which is to the south of Wisconsin, but the longitude depends on where in Illinois. If the Ort Institute is in the western part of Illinois, near the Mississippi River, then it would be west of Sheboygan, Wisconsin. But if it's in the eastern part of Illinois, then it would be east of Sheboygan. So I need to find out the exact locations of both places.

Let me try to recall or estimate their coordinates. Sheboygan, Wisconsin is at approximately 43.5° N, 87.7° W. The Ort Institute in Illinois—I'm not sure where exactly it is. Let me think. The Ort Institute is a Jewish educational institution. I think there's one in Chicago, Illinois. If that's the case, then Chicago is in northeastern Illinois, so its coordinates would be around 41.8° N, 87.6° W. Wait, that's very close in longitude to Sheboygan. But Sheboygan is at 43.5° N, 87.7° W, and Chicago is at 41.8° N, 87.6° W. So their longitudes are almost the same. So if the Ort Institute is in Chicago, then it's almost directly south of Sheboygan, but not west or east. So in that case, the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan would be slightly west of Chicago, but only by a tiny amount. Wait, 87.7° W vs. 87.6° W. So Sheboygan is 0.1 degrees west, which is about 11 kilometers (7 miles) west. So technically, it's slightly west. But maybe the Ort Institute is in a different part of Illinois. If it's in the western part of Illinois, like near the Mississippi River, then it would be further west. For example, Quincy, Illinois is around 40.4° N, 89.6° W. That's much further west. So if the Ort Institute is in Quincy, then it's west of Sheboygan. But if it's in Chicago, then it's almost the same longitude.

But the question is about The Ort Institute in Illinois. I need to confirm where exactly The Ort Institute is located. Let me think. The Ort Institute of Chicago is a real place, so if that's the one in question, then it's in Chicago. So if the Ort Institute is in Chicago, then the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is slightly west of it. But if the Ort Institute is in another part of Illinois, like the western part, then it might be west of Sheboygan. But the question doesn't specify the location of the Ort Institute in Illinois, just that it's in Illinois. So I need to assume the most well-known Ort Institute in Illinois, which is likely in Chicago.

Therefore, if the Ort Institute is in Chicago, Illinois, then the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is slightly west of it. But the difference is minimal. However, the question is whether it's located west of The Ort Institute. So if the longitude of Sheboygan is 87.7° W and the Ort Institute is at 87.6° W, then Sheboygan is west of the Ort Institute. But if the Ort Institute is further west, like in Quincy, then it's the other way around. But since the question doesn't specify, I have to go with the most probable location, which is Chicago. Therefore, the answer would be Yes, the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is west of The Ort Institute in Illinois (assuming it's in Chicago). However, if the Ort Institute is in a different part of Illinois, the answer could vary. But given the information, I think the answer is Yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan (UW–Sheboygan) is located west of The Ort Institute in Illinois, we need to compare their approximate longitudes.

---

### Step 1: Identify the Locations
- **University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan** is located in **Sheboygan, Wisconsin**.  
  - Approximate coordinates: **43.5° N, 87.7° W**.

- **The Ort Institute in Illinois** is most likely referring to the **Ort Institute of Chicago**, a well-known Jewish educational institution.  
  - Approximate coordinates for **Chicago, Illinois**: **41.8° N, 87.6° W**.

---

### Step 2: Compare Longitudes
- **Sheboygan, WI**: 87.7° W  
- **Chicago, IL (Ort Institute)**: 87.6° W  

Since **87.7° W is slightly west of 87.6° W**, the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is **slightly west** of The Ort Institute in Chicago, Illinois.

---

### Step 3: Consider Alternative Locations in Illinois
If The Ort Institute were located in a more **western** part of Illinois (e.g., **Quincy, IL** at ~89.6° W), it would be **west** of Sheboygan. However, the question does not specify a different location, and the most prominent Ort Institute in Illinois is in **Chicago**.

---

### Final Answer:
**Yes**, the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is located west of The Ort Institute in Illinois (assuming the latter is in Chicago).
