Okay, so I need to figure out if Newellton, Louisiana is east of Garnavillo, Iowa. Let me start by recalling the general locations of Louisiana and Iowa. Louisiana is in the southern part of the United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico. Iowa is in the Midwest, further north and west. But I need to be more precise.

First, I should find the approximate coordinates or the general direction of each city. Maybe I can use a map or some geographical knowledge. Let me think. Louisiana is to the south of Iowa, but does that mean Newellton is east or west of Garnavillo?

Wait, the question is about east-west direction. So even if Louisiana is south of Iowa, the east-west position depends on their longitudes. If Newellton has a higher longitude (more east) than Garnavillo, then it's east. If lower, then west.

I need to remember or look up the approximate longitudes. Let me try to recall. Louisiana is generally west of the Mississippi River, but Newellton is in the western part of Louisiana, near the Texas border. Wait, no, Newellton is in Rapides Parish, which is in central Louisiana. Wait, maybe I should check the longitude. Let me think. The Mississippi River runs through Louisiana, so cities east of the river would be in the eastern part. Newellton is in central Louisiana, maybe around the 92nd or 93rd meridian west? Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think of other cities. Baton Rouge is around 90° W longitude. New Orleans is about 90° W as well. So if Newellton is in central Louisiana, maybe around 92° W?

Garnavillo, Iowa. Iowa is in the Midwest. Let me think of Iowa's longitude. Des Moines is around 93.5° W. So if Garnavillo is in Iowa, maybe around 92° W to 94° W? Let me think. Iowa is east of the Mississippi River, so cities in Iowa would be east of the river. The Mississippi runs through the western part of Louisiana, so if Newellton is in central Louisiana, maybe it's west of the Mississippi, while Garnavillo is east of the Mississippi in Iowa. Wait, but if that's the case, then Garnavillo would be east of the river, and Newellton west. So if the Mississippi is a dividing line, then Newellton is west of the river, and Garnavillo east. So Newellton would be west of Garnavillo. Therefore, the answer would be No, Newellton is not east of Garnavillo.

But I need to confirm. Let me try to get approximate coordinates. Let me think. Newellton, LA: I can recall that Rapides Parish is in central Louisiana. Let me think of cities. Alexandria, LA is in Rapides Parish, I think. Wait, no, Alexandria is in Rapides Parish. Wait, Newellton is a small town in Rapides Parish. So if Alexandria is around 31.3° N, 92.7° W, then Newellton is probably near there. Let me check in my mind. So Newellton's longitude is around 92.7° W.

Garnavillo, IA: Let me think. Iowa is east of the Mississippi. Let me think of cities in Iowa. Cedar Rapids is around 41.9° N, 91.7° W. So if Garnavillo is in Iowa, maybe in the central or eastern part. Let me think. If Cedar Rapids is at 91.7° W, then Garnavillo might be around 92° W or so. Wait, but if Newellton is at 92.7° W and Garnavillo is at 92° W, then Garnavillo is east of Newellton. So Newellton is west of Garnavillo. Therefore, the answer is No.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of time zones. Louisiana is in the Central Time Zone, as is Iowa. But that doesn't help much. Maybe the direction. If you go from Louisiana to Iowa, you're going north and east? Wait, Louisiana is south of Iowa. So to go from Louisiana to Iowa, you'd go north and maybe east or west depending on the cities. But if Newellton is in central Louisiana, and Garnavillo is in Iowa, which is north and east of Louisiana. Wait, but Iowa is to the north and east of Louisiana? Or north and west? Let me think. Louisiana is south of the Mississippi River. Iowa is north of the Mississippi. So if you cross the Mississippi from Louisiana into Iowa, you'd be going north and east? Or north and west? The Mississippi River flows roughly south to north. So in the area of Louisiana, the river is the western boundary of Louisiana. So to go from Louisiana to Iowa, you'd cross the Mississippi into Missouri or Illinois, then into Iowa. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Louisiana's western border is the Red River with Texas. The eastern part of Louisiana is near the Mississippi River. So if Newellton is in central Louisiana, it's west of the Mississippi. To get to Iowa, you'd have to go north across the Mississippi into Missouri or Illinois, then into Iowa. So Iowa is north and east of Louisiana. Therefore, Garnavillo, IA would be north and east of Newellton, LA. Therefore, Newellton is west of Garnavillo. So the answer is No, Newellton is not east of Garnavillo.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Geographical Context:**
   - **Newellton, LA** is located in central Louisiana, near the Red River (bordering Texas), and is west of the Mississippi River.
   - **Garnavillo, IA** is in Iowa, which lies north of the Mississippi River, placing it east of the river.

2. **Longitude Comparison:**
   - **Newellton, LA** has an approximate longitude of **92.7° W**.
   - **Garnavillo, IA** has an approximate longitude of **92.0° W**.
   - A lower longitude (closer to 0°) indicates a more eastern location. Since **92.0° W (Garnavillo)** is east of **92.7° W (Newellton)**, Newellton is west of Garnavillo.

3. **Directional Relationship:**
   - Louisiana is generally south of Iowa, but the key factor here is the **Mississippi River**. Newellton is west of the river, while Garnavillo is east of it. This places Newellton west of Garnavillo.

**Final Answer:**  
**No**, Newellton, LA is not east of Garnavillo, IA.
