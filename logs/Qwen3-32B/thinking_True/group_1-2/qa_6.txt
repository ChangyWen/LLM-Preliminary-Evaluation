Okay, so I need to figure out which of these two articles was published first: "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained." versus "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal." 

First, I should check the dates of both articles. But since I don't have access to the actual articles or their publication dates, I need to think of another way. Maybe the titles can give some clues. 

The first article mentions an activist running for mayor of Moscow. Moscow is a city in Russia. The second article talks about a deficit deal and recess, which sounds like it's related to the U.S. government, maybe the federal budget. 

Now, considering the time periods when these topics were prominent. The Moscow mayor election might be a more recent event, but I'm not sure. The deficit deal and recess could refer to the 2011 U.S. debt ceiling crisis, which was a major event around that time. The 2011 debt ceiling crisis was in August 2011, and the U.S. government shutdown in October 2013. 

Wait, the second article mentions "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal." The term "recess" here might refer to a government shutdown. The 2013 government shutdown was in October, so maybe the article is from that time. 

The first article about the Moscow mayor candidate. Moscow mayoral elections in Russia... The last one was in 2023, where the current mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, was re-elected. But there was also an election in 2013. If the activist was running in 2013, that might be possible. 

So if the second article is from 2013 (October) and the first one is also from 2013, but maybe earlier in the year. However, the 2013 Moscow mayoral election was in September 2013. So if the activist was detained in September 2013, and the deficit deal article is from October 2013, then the first article would be earlier. 

Alternatively, if the deficit deal article is from 2011, then it would be earlier. But the term "recess" in the title might refer to the 2013 shutdown. 

So, putting it all together: The Moscow mayor election article is from September 2013, and the deficit deal article is from October 2013. Therefore, the first article was published earlier. 

But I need to be careful. Maybe the deficit deal article is from 2011. Let me think again. The 2011 debt ceiling crisis was in August 2011, leading to a government shutdown in October 2011. The term "deficit deal" could refer to that. If the article is from 2011, then it's earlier than the Moscow article from 2013. 

But the user is asking which was published first. If the Moscow article is from 2013 and the deficit deal from 2011, then the deficit deal is earlier. If both are from 2013, then the Moscow one is earlier. 

I need to check the exact dates. Let me try to recall. The 2013 Moscow mayoral election was on September 8, 2013. The 2013 U.S. government shutdown started on October 1, 2013. So if the Moscow article is from September 2013 and the deficit deal from October 2013, then the Moscow article is earlier. 

Therefore, the answer would be Yes, the first article was published earlier than the second one.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine which article was published first, we analyze the context and likely publication dates of the two headlines:

1. **"Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained."**  
   - This refers to the 2013 Moscow mayoral election, where Sergei Sobyanin was re-elected. The election occurred on **September 8, 2013**. The activist mentioned (likely Alexei Navalny, a prominent opposition figure) was detained during this period. This article would have been published in **September 2013**.

2. **"Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal."**  
   - This references the **2013 U.S. government shutdown**, which began on **October 1, 2013**, due to a budget impasse. The article likely discusses the looming shutdown and deficit negotiations, placing its publication in **October 2013**.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**  
- The Moscow mayoral election (September 2013) predates the 2013 U.S. government shutdown (October 2013).  
- The first article is tied to an event in September 2013, while the second is tied to October 2013.  
- Therefore, the first article was published earlier.

**Final Answer:**  
Yes.
