Okay, so I need to figure out whether William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey died after Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two historical figures.

First, William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. I remember he was a medieval English nobleman. He was a companion of William the Conqueror and played a role in the Norman Conquest. I think he was granted lands in England after the conquest. His death date... I'm not exactly sure, but I think he died in the late 11th century. Maybe around 1088? I've heard that before. Let me check that. Yes, I believe William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, died in 1088.

Now, Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy. She was a member of the House of Aquitaine, I think. She married Humbert II, Count of Savoy. I need to find her death date. Agnes of Aquitaine was born around 1040 and died in 1109. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Yes, Agnes of Aquitaine, also known as Agnes of Dijon, married Humbert II of Savoy. She was a significant figure in the 11th century. Her death is recorded as 1109. 

So, if William de Warenne died in 1088 and Agnes of Aquitaine died in 1109, then Agnes died 21 years after William. Therefore, William died before Agnes. The question is whether he died later than her. Since he died in 1088 and she in 1109, the answer would be no. He died earlier. 

Wait, but I should make sure there's no confusion between different people with similar names. Let me double-check the dates. William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, died in 1088. Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy, died in 1109. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is no, William did not die later than Agnes; he died earlier.
