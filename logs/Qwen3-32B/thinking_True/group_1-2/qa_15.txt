<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if Schiller International University in Florida is located north of The University of Tampa, also in Florida. Let me start by recalling what I know about these universities and their locations.

First, I know that both universities are in Florida, but I'm not exactly sure where in Florida each one is located. The University of Tampa is a well-known institution, so maybe I can remember its location. I think the University of Tampa is in Tampa, Florida. That makes sense because the name includes "Tampa." Now, Schiller International University—I'm less familiar with. I think it might be in a different city in Florida. Wait, I remember that Schiller International University has a campus in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Is that right? Fort Lauderdale is in Broward County, while Tampa is in Hillsborough County. 

Now, I need to determine the relative positions of Fort Lauderdale and Tampa. If Fort Lauderdale is north of Tampa, then Schiller International University would be north of the University of Tampa. But I'm not sure about the direction between these two cities. Let me think. Florida is a peninsula, and Tampa is in the west-central part of the state. Fort Lauderdale is in the southeastern part, part of the Miami metropolitan area. So, if Fort Lauderdale is in the southeast, and Tampa is more central-west, then Fort Lauderdale would be to the east and south of Tampa. Wait, that might not be right. Let me visualize a map of Florida. Tampa is on the west coast, near the Gulf of Mexico. Fort Lauderdale is on the east coast, near the Atlantic Ocean. So, if you go from Tampa to Fort Lauderdale, you'd be going east and then south, maybe? Or is Fort Lauderdale north of Tampa? Hmm, I'm getting confused here. 

Wait, let me think of other cities. For example, Orlando is north of Tampa. So if Fort Lauderdale is south of Orlando, then it's south of Tampa. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Fort Lauderdale is north of Tampa. Let me try to recall the approximate latitudes. Tampa's latitude is around 27.9944° N. Fort Lauderdale's latitude is around 26.1223° N. Wait, that can't be right. If Fort Lauderdale is at 26 degrees, that's actually south of Tampa, which is at 28 degrees. So if Schiller International University is in Fort Lauderdale, then it's south of the University of Tampa. But I need to confirm if Schiller International University is indeed in Fort Lauderdale. 

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the campuses. I think Schiller International University has multiple campuses. Let me check. I remember that Schiller has a campus in Paris, France, and another in Florida. I think the Florida campus is in Fort Lauderdale. Let me confirm that. If that's the case, then Fort Lauderdale is in Broward County, Florida. The University of Tampa is in Tampa, Hillsborough County. 

Now, to determine the direction, I need to know the relative positions of Fort Lauderdale and Tampa. If Fort Lauderdale is south of Tampa, then Schiller would be south, so the answer would be no. If it's north, then yes. Let me think again. Tampa is in the west central part of Florida. Fort Lauderdale is in the southeast. So, if you go from Tampa to Fort Lauderdale, you'd go east and then south. Therefore, Fort Lauderdale is to the southeast of Tampa. That would mean it's both east and south. So, in terms of north-south, it's south. Therefore, Schiller International University in Fort Lauderdale would be south of the University of Tampa. Therefore, the answer would be no. 

But wait, maybe I'm wrong about the location of Schiller International University. Let me verify. I think Schiller International University's Florida campus is in Fort Lauderdale. Let me check. A quick search in my mind: yes, Schiller International University has a campus in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. So that's correct. Therefore, Fort Lauderdale is south of Tampa. Therefore, the answer is no. 

But I should also consider if there's another campus of Schiller International University in Florida that's north of Tampa. For example, maybe in Gainesville or Tallahassee? But I don't think so. The main Florida campus is in Fort Lauderdale. So, assuming that the question refers to the Florida campus of Schiller International University, which is in Fort Lauderdale, then it's south of Tampa. Therefore, the answer is no.
