Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether Peter R. Hunt's "Gold" was released later than Elliot Silverstein's "Nightmare Honeymoon." I need to figure out the release dates of both movies to compare them.

First, I should recall or look up the release years for both films. I know that Peter R. Hunt directed "Gold," but I'm not exactly sure when that came out. Maybe it's from the 1970s? Wait, "Gold" is a 1974 film, I think. Let me confirm that. Yes, "Gold" was released in 1974.

Now, "Nightmare Honeymoon" by Elliot Silverstein. I'm less familiar with that one. Let me think. Elliot Silverstein directed some movies in the 60s and 70s. "Nightmare Honeymoon" might be from the 1960s. Wait, I remember that "Nightmare Honeymoon" was released in 1965. Let me double-check that. Yes, 1965 is correct.

So, "Nightmare Honeymoon" came out in 1965, and "Gold" in 1974. Comparing the two years, 1974 is later than 1965. Therefore, Peter R. Hunt's "Gold" was released after Elliot Silverstein's "Nightmare Honeymoon." The answer should be Yes.
