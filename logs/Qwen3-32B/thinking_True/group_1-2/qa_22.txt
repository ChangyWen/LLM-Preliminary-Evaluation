Okay, so I need to figure out if Dal-Tex Building in Texas is located south of Lake Martin in Alabama. Let me start by recalling the locations of these places.

First, Dal-Tex Building. I know that Dal-Tex is a company based in Texas, probably in Dallas since "Dal" might stand for Dallas and "Tex" for Texas. So Dal-Tex Building is likely in Dallas, Texas. Now, Dallas is a major city in Texas, located in the northern part of the state. Wait, actually, I think Dallas is in the north-central part of Texas. Let me confirm that. Yes, Dallas is in the northern part of Texas, near the Red River which forms the border with Oklahoma.

Next, Lake Martin is in Alabama. Alabama is a state in the southeastern United States. Lake Martin is a reservoir, so it's probably in the northern part of Alabama. Let me think. I remember that Lake Martin is in Talladega County, which is in the northern part of Alabama, near the Tennessee border. So Lake Martin is in northern Alabama.

Now, the question is whether Dallas, Texas (where Dal-Tex Building is) is south of Lake Martin, Alabama. To determine this, I need to compare their latitudes. If Dallas is at a lower latitude than Lake Martin, then it's south of it.

Let me recall the approximate latitudes. Dallas, Texas is around 32.7767° N. Lake Martin, Alabama is in Talladega County, which is around 33.9000° N. Wait, so Dallas is at about 32.8° N and Lake Martin is at about 33.9° N. That would mean Dallas is south of Lake Martin because lower latitude numbers are further south. 

But wait, I should double-check these coordinates. Let me think. Dallas is in the northern part of Texas, but Texas as a state is quite large. The northernmost part of Texas is near the Red River, which is around 36° N, but Dallas is a bit south of that. Let me confirm. Dallas's latitude is approximately 32.7767° N. Lake Martin's latitude is around 33.9000° N. So yes, Dallas is at a lower latitude, meaning it's further south. Therefore, Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, Texas is south of Lake Martin, Alabama.

But wait, could there be another Dal-Tex Building in a different part of Texas? Maybe in the southern part? But the name Dal-Tex suggests Dallas-Texas, so it's likely in Dallas. Also, if there's a Dal-Tex Building in a southern Texas city like Houston, that would be even further south. But regardless, even if it's in Houston, which is around 29.7604° N, that's even further south than Dallas. So regardless of the exact location in Texas, Texas is generally south of Alabama. But specifically, Dallas is in northern Texas, but still south of northern Alabama.

So the answer should be Yes, Dal-Tex Building in Texas is located south of Lake Martin, Alabama.
