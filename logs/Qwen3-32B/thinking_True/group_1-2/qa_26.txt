Okay, so I need to figure out if the ZIP code 97233 in Oregon is located west of 98580 in Washington. Let me start by recalling how ZIP codes work. Each ZIP code corresponds to a specific geographic area, usually a city or part of a city. To determine if one is west of another, I need to find the approximate locations of these ZIP codes.

First, I should identify the cities associated with these ZIP codes. Let me think. 97233 is in Oregon. I'm not exactly sure which city that is, but maybe I can remember or look up. Similarly, 98580 is in Washington. I know that Washington state is to the north of Oregon, but the question is about east-west, not north-south. So I need to check if Oregon's ZIP code is west of Washington's.

Wait, but Oregon is west of Washington in terms of states. So if 97233 is in Oregon, and 98580 is in Washington, then maybe the answer is yes? But I need to be careful here. Because even though Oregon is west of Washington, the specific ZIP codes might be in different parts of the states. For example, if 98580 is in eastern Washington, then it might be east of Oregon. But if it's in western Washington, then Oregon's ZIP code would be west of it.

So I need to find the exact locations. Let me try to recall or think of cities in those ZIP codes. 97233... Hmm. Maybe it's in Portland? Wait, Portland is in Oregon, and its ZIP codes start with 972... So 97233 is likely in Portland, Oregon. Now, 98580 in Washington. Let me think. 98580 is in the state of Washington. What cities in Washington have ZIP codes starting with 985? I know that Seattle's ZIP codes start with 981... So 985 might be in another part. Maybe the 985 area is in the eastern part of Washington? Wait, no. Let me think. The 985 area code... Wait, ZIP codes and area codes are different, but maybe there's a correlation. Wait, no, that's not helpful. Let me think of specific cities. For example, 98580 is in the state of Washington. Let me think of cities in Washington. Maybe it's in the Puget Sound area? Or maybe in the eastern part. Let me try to remember. I think 98580 is in the city of Vancouver, Washington. Wait, Vancouver is in Washington state, just across the Columbia River from Portland, Oregon. So if 97233 is in Portland, Oregon, and 98580 is in Vancouver, Washington, then Vancouver is east of Portland. Because Portland is west of the Columbia River, and Vancouver is east of it. So in that case, 97233 (Portland) would be west of 98580 (Vancouver). So the answer would be yes.

But wait, I need to confirm if 98580 is indeed in Vancouver, Washington. Let me think. Vancouver, WA has ZIP codes like 98660, 98661, etc. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe 98580 is in another city. Let me think. Another approach: use the fact that ZIP codes can be looked up for their approximate coordinates. If I can find the approximate latitude and longitude for both ZIP codes, I can compare their longitudes. The one with the higher longitude (more positive) is further west, since longitude increases as you go east. Wait, no, longitude is measured in degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian. So a more negative longitude would be further west. For example, a place with longitude -122 is further west than a place with longitude -120. So if I can find the longitudes of both ZIP codes, I can compare them.

So let me try to estimate the longitudes. Portland, Oregon is around 45.5° N latitude and 122.6° W longitude. If 97233 is in Portland, then its longitude is approximately -122.6. Now, Vancouver, Washington is just across the river from Portland. Its coordinates are roughly 45.6° N and 122.5° W. Wait, so Vancouver, WA is at -122.5, which is slightly east of Portland's -122.6. So Portland is further west. Therefore, if 98580 is in Vancouver, WA, then 97233 (Portland) is west of 98580 (Vancouver). So the answer would be yes.

But I need to confirm that 98580 is indeed in Vancouver, WA. Let me think. I can recall that the ZIP code 98660 is in Vancouver, WA. But 98580... Hmm. Maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think of another way. The first three digits of a ZIP code in the US are the ZIP code prefix, which can give a general area. For example, in the Pacific Northwest, ZIP codes starting with 972 are in Oregon, and 985 are in Washington. But I need to be precise. Let me think of specific cities. For example, Seattle's ZIP codes start with 981, 980, etc. The 985 area might be in the eastern part of Washington. Wait, but Vancouver is in Clark County, Washington, which is in the southwest corner of the state, right next to Portland. So if 98580 is in Vancouver, WA, then it's west of, say, Seattle, but east of Portland. So if 97233 is in Portland, then yes, it's west of 98580 in Vancouver.

Alternatively, maybe 98580 is in a different part of Washington. Let me think. For example, if it's in the state of Washington but in the eastern part, like Spokane, which is in eastern Washington. But Spokane's ZIP codes start with 992... So 98580 is not in Spokane. Maybe in the Tri-Cities area? Those ZIP codes start with 993... So no. So 98580 is more likely in the southwest part of Washington, near Portland. So Vancouver, WA is a good candidate.

Another way to check is to use the fact that the boundary between Oregon and Washington runs along the Columbia River. So if 98580 is in Washington, just across the river from Portland, then it's east of Portland. Therefore, 97233 (Portland) is west of 98580 (Vancouver, WA). So the answer is yes.

But to be thorough, maybe I should look up the exact locations. However, since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my existing knowledge. Let me try to recall. The city of Vancouver, WA is indeed across the Columbia River from Portland, OR. The ZIP code 98660 is in Vancouver, WA. But 98580... Hmm. Maybe it's a different ZIP code in Vancouver. Let me think. The 985 prefix is used in some parts of Washington. For example, the 985 area code is in the state, but that's for phone numbers. Wait, no, ZIP codes and area codes are different. Let me think again. The first three digits of a ZIP code in the US are the ZIP code prefix. For example, 972 is in Oregon, 985 is in Washington. So 98580 is in Washington. Now, if I can think of a city in Washington with ZIP code 98580, and if that city is east of Portland, then the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe 98580 is in a city that's west of Portland. But that would be impossible because Portland is in Oregon, and Washington is to the north. Wait, no, the states are adjacent along the Columbia River. So the westernmost part of Washington is near the Columbia River, just east of Portland. So if 98580 is in that area, then it's east of Portland. Therefore, 97233 (Portland) is west of 98580 (Vancouver, WA). So the answer is yes.

Therefore, after this reasoning, I think the answer is yes.
