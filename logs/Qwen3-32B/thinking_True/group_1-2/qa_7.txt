Okay, let's see. The question is whether William II, Count of Chalon lived longer than Anastasia of Sirmium. I need to figure out their lifespans and compare them.

First, I should find out when William II, Count of Chalon was born and died. I remember that the Counts of Chalon were part of the medieval nobility in France. William II might have been a 12th or 13th-century figure. Let me check... Hmm, I think William II of Chalon was born around 1170 and died in 1217. So his lifespan would be about 47 years.

Now, Anastasia of Sirmium. Sirmium was an ancient city in what is now Serbia. Anastasia might be a saint or a historical figure. I recall that there was a Saint Anastasia, but I'm not sure about the exact dates. Let me think. Saint Anastasia of Sirmium is a Christian martyr, possibly from the 4th century. If she was martyred in the 4th century, say around 340 AD, then her lifespan would be much shorter. But wait, if she was a martyr, she might have been killed in her youth. Maybe she was in her 20s or 30s when she died. So her lifespan would be, say, 30 years or less.

Comparing the two: William II lived to 47, Anastasia maybe 30. So yes, William lived longer. But wait, I need to confirm the exact dates. Let me verify. William II of Chalon: born 1170, died 1217. That's 47 years. Anastasia of Sirmium: if she was born around 300 AD and died in 340, that's 40 years. But if she was a martyr, maybe she was younger. Some sources say she was a young woman, maybe 24 when she died. So her lifespan would be 24. Then William's 47 is longer. So the answer would be Yes.
