<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if Lake Vico is located west of Pragser Wildsee. Let me start by recalling what I know about these places. I think both are lakes in the Alps, maybe in Italy or Austria? I'm not entirely sure. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should confirm the locations of both lakes. Pragser Wildsee is a lake I've heard of before. I believe it's in the Dolomites, which are part of the Alps. Specifically, I think it's in South Tyrol, which is a region in northern Italy. So Pragser Wildsee is in Italy, in the Dolomites. Now, Lake Vico... Hmm, I'm less familiar with that name. Maybe it's another lake in the same area? Or perhaps in a different part of the Alps?

Wait, Lake Vico might be in the Valtellina region. Valtellina is in Lombardy, Italy, which is to the north of South Tyrol. So if Pragser Wildsee is in South Tyrol and Lake Vico is in Lombardy, I need to check their relative positions. Let me visualize a map of northern Italy. South Tyrol is in the northeast part of Italy, bordering Austria. Lombardy is to the west of South Tyrol, but Valtellina is a valley that runs from the Swiss border down into Lombardy. So if Lake Vico is in Valtellina, it might be west of Pragser Wildsee, which is in South Tyrol.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the regions. Let me try to get more precise. Pragser Wildsee is near the town of San Cassiano (Sankt Kassian) in the Val Pusteria (Pustertal) valley. Val Pusteria is a valley that runs from Austria into South Tyrol. So Pragser Wildsee is in the eastern part of South Tyrol, near the Austrian border. Lake Vico, on the other hand, is in the Valtellina valley, which is in the Lombardy region. Valtellina is to the west of South Tyrol. So if Lake Vico is in Lombardy's Valtellina, then it would be west of Pragser Wildsee in South Tyrol.

But wait, I should check the exact coordinates. Let me think. Pragser Wildsee's coordinates are approximately 46.85° N, 12.45° E. Lake Vico's coordinates are around 46.15° N, 9.65° E. If that's correct, then Lake Vico is both south and west of Pragser Wildsee. But I'm not sure if those coordinates are accurate. Maybe I should verify.

Alternatively, I can think of the direction from South Tyrol to Lombardy. South Tyrol is in the northeast of Italy, and Lombardy is more to the north and west. Valtellina is a valley that runs from the Swiss border down to Lake Como. So if Pragser Wildsee is in the eastern part of South Tyrol, then moving west from there would take you into the Veneto region or towards Lombardy. Since Valtellina is in Lombardy, which is west of South Tyrol, then Lake Vico in Valtellina would indeed be west of Pragser Wildsee.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should consider the towns near these lakes. Pragser Wildsee is near San Cassiano, which is in the Val Pusteria. Lake Vico is near the town of Vico, in the Valtellina. If I look at a map, Val Pusteria is in the east of South Tyrol, and Valtellina is in the west of Lombardy. So the distance between them would be from the eastern part of South Tyrol to the western part of Lombardy. That would mean Lake Vico is west of Pragser Wildsee.

Another way to check is to see if there are any other landmarks. For example, the city of Bolzano is in South Tyrol, near the Austrian border. If I go west from Bolzano, I'd reach the Veneto region, and further west into Lombardy. Valtellina is in Lombardy, so that would be west of South Tyrol. Therefore, Lake Vico in Valtellina would be west of Pragser Wildsee in South Tyrol.

I think that's the case. So the answer would be Yes, Lake Vico is located west of Pragser Wildsee.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
Yes, Lake Vico is located west of Pragser Wildsee. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Identify Locations:**
   - **Pragser Wildsee** is a lake in the Dolomites, situated in the Val Pusteria valley within South Tyrol, Italy (approximate coordinates: 46.85° N, 12.45° E).
   - **Lake Vico** is located in the Valtellina valley, part of the Lombardy region in northern Italy (approximate coordinates: 46.15° N, 9.65° E).

2. **Geographical Context:**
   - South Tyrol (where Pragser Wildsee lies) is in the **eastern part** of northern Italy, bordering Austria.
   - Lombardy (where Lake Vico is located) is to the **west** of South Tyrol. The Valtellina valley runs from the Swiss border through Lombardy, placing it west of the Dolomites.

3. **Directional Analysis:**
   - Moving west from South Tyrol (e.g., from Bolzano) leads into the Veneto and Lombardy regions.
   - Valtellina (and thus Lake Vico) is positioned west of the Val Pusteria valley, confirming Lake Vico's location west of Pragser Wildsee.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
