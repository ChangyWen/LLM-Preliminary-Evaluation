Okay, so the question is whether the Atlantic Ocean is larger than the Pacific Ocean. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about the sizes of the world's oceans. I remember that the Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe I should check the exact areas of both.

First, I think the Pacific Ocean is the biggest. But I should confirm the numbers. Let me try to remember. The Pacific is something like 165 million square kilometers? Or was that the Atlantic? Wait, no, the Atlantic is smaller. I think the Pacific is about 165 million square kilometers, and the Atlantic is around 106 million. But I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should break it down.

The Earth's surface is about 510 million square kilometers, and about 71% is covered by water. The oceans are divided into five: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic. The Pacific is the largest, followed by the Atlantic. The Indian Ocean is third, then the Southern, and the Arctic is the smallest. So if the Pacific is first, then the Atlantic must be second. Therefore, the Atlantic is not larger than the Pacific. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the order. Let me think again.

I recall that the Pacific Ocean has the most area. For example, the Mariana Trench is in the Pacific, and it's the deepest part of the ocean. But depth doesn't directly relate to surface area. The key here is the surface area. So, if the Pacific is the largest by area, then the answer is no, the Atlantic is not larger. But I need to get the exact numbers to be sure.

Looking up in my memory, the Pacific Ocean's area is approximately 165.25 million square kilometers. The Atlantic Ocean is about 106.46 million square kilometers. So comparing those two numbers, 165 million is definitely larger than 106 million. Therefore, the Pacific is larger than the Atlantic. So the answer should be no, the Atlantic is not larger than the Pacific. Wait, but I should make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. Let me verify once more. Yes, the Pacific is the largest, followed by the Atlantic. So the answer is no.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Oceans in Question:** The question compares the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.

2. **Recall General Knowledge:** The Pacific Ocean is widely recognized as the largest ocean on Earth, followed by the Atlantic Ocean. This is a common geographical fact.

3. **Verify Surface Area Data:**
   - **Pacific Ocean:** Approximately **165.25 million square kilometers**.
   - **Atlantic Ocean:** Approximately **106.46 million square kilometers**.

4. **Compare the Numbers:** 
   - 165.25 million (Pacific) is significantly larger than 106.46 million (Atlantic).

5. **Conclusion:** Since the Pacific Ocean has a greater surface area than the Atlantic Ocean, the Atlantic is not larger.

**Final Answer:** No.
