Okay, so the question is whether the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is less than that on the Moon. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about gravity.

First, I remember that the acceleration due to gravity on a planet or moon depends on its mass and radius. The formula for gravitational acceleration at the surface is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation. The formula is g = G*M/R², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the celestial body, and R is its radius. So, if I can compare the mass and radius of Earth and the Moon, I can determine which has a higher gravitational acceleration.

Let me jot down the approximate values. Earth's mass is about 5.97 × 10^24 kg, and its radius is roughly 6,371 km. The Moon's mass is much smaller, around 7.34 × 10^22 kg, and its radius is about 1,737 km. So Earth is both more massive and larger in radius than the Moon. But how do these factors affect the acceleration?

Since the formula is g = G*M/R², the acceleration is directly proportional to the mass and inversely proportional to the square of the radius. So even though the Moon has a smaller radius, its mass is significantly less. Let me plug in the numbers to see.

For Earth: g_earth = (6.674×10^-11 N·m²/kg²) * (5.97×10^24 kg) / (6.371×10^6 m)^2. Let me calculate that. First, the numerator: 6.674e-11 * 5.97e24. Let me compute that. 6.674 * 5.97 is approximately 39.8 (since 6.674*6 is 40.044, minus 6.674*0.03 which is ~0.200, so about 39.84). So 39.84 × 10^( -11 +24 ) = 39.84 × 10^13. Then the denominator is (6.371e6)^2. Let's square 6.371e6. 6.371 squared is approximately 40.58 (since 6.3^2 is 39.69, 6.4^2 is 40.96, so 6.37^2 is around 40.58). So the denominator is 40.58 × 10^12 m². Therefore, g_earth ≈ (39.84 × 10^13) / (40.58 × 10^12) ≈ (39.84 / 40.58) × 10^(13-12) ≈ 0.98 × 10^1 ≈ 9.8 m/s². That's the standard value for Earth's gravity, so that checks out.

Now for the Moon: g_moon = (6.674×10^-11) * (7.34×10^22) / (1.737×10^6)^2. Let's compute the numerator first: 6.674e-11 * 7.34e22. 6.674 * 7.34 is approximately 49 (since 6.674*7 is 46.718, plus 6.674*0.34 ≈ 2.269, total ≈ 48.987). So 49 × 10^(-11 +22) = 49 × 10^11. The denominator is (1.737e6)^2. 1.737 squared is approximately 3.017 (since 1.7^2 is 2.89, 1.74^2 is 3.0276). So the denominator is 3.017 × 10^12 m². Therefore, g_moon ≈ (49 × 10^11) / (3.017 × 10^12) ≈ (49 / 3.017) × 10^(11-12) ≈ 16.24 × 10^-1 ≈ 1.624 m/s². 

So Earth's gravity is about 9.8 m/s², and the Moon's is about 1.624 m/s². Therefore, Earth's gravity is greater than the Moon's. The question is asking if Earth's gravity is less than the Moon's, which would be "No." 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. The Moon's gravity is about 1/6th of Earth's, right? 9.8 divided by 6 is roughly 1.63, which matches the calculation. So yes, the Moon's gravity is about 1.6 m/s², which is less than Earth's 9.8 m/s². Therefore, the answer is No, the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is not less than that on the Moon; it's actually greater.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Gravitational Acceleration Formula:**  
   The acceleration due to gravity on a celestial body is given by:  
   $$
   g = \frac{G \cdot M}{R^2}
   $$  
   where $ G $ is the gravitational constant, $ M $ is the mass, and $ R $ is the radius of the body.

2. **Earth's Parameters:**  
   - Mass ($ M_{\text{Earth}} $): $ 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} $  
   - Radius ($ R_{\text{Earth}} $): $ 6,371 \, \text{km} = 6.371 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} $  
   - Calculated $ g_{\text{Earth}} \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 $.

3. **Moon's Parameters:**  
   - Mass ($ M_{\text{Moon}} $): $ 7.34 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg} $  
   - Radius ($ R_{\text{Moon}} $): $ 1,737 \, \text{km} = 1.737 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} $  
   - Calculated $ g_{\text{Moon}} \approx 1.624 \, \text{m/s}^2 $.

4. **Comparison:**  
   - Earth's gravity ($ 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 $) is significantly greater than the Moon's ($ 1.624 \, \text{m/s}^2 $).  
   - The Moon's gravity is roughly $ \frac{1}{6} $ of Earth's.

**Final Answer:**  
No.
