Okay, so the question is whether the average lifespan of a dog is longer than that of a human. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to recall the average lifespans of both dogs and humans. I know that humans generally live longer than many animals, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers. For dogs, I remember that different breeds have different lifespans. Smaller dogs tend to live longer than larger ones. For example, a Chihuahua might live 15-20 years, while a Great Dane might only live 8-10 years. But the question is about the average lifespan of a dog in general, not a specific breed. So I should look up the average for all dogs combined.

From what I've heard, the average lifespan of a dog is around 10-13 years. But I'm not 100% certain. Maybe I should check some sources. Let me think... I remember reading that the global average for a dog's lifespan is approximately 10 to 13 years. That's based on various studies and data from different countries. So taking the midpoint, maybe around 11.5 years on average.

Now for humans, the average lifespan varies by country and other factors like healthcare, lifestyle, etc. The global average life expectancy at birth is around 72-73 years. For example, in 2023, the World Health Organization reported that the global average life expectancy is about 73 years. However, in some developed countries, it's higher, like 80 years or more, while in some developing countries, it might be lower. But the question is about the average, so we can take the global average of around 73 years.

Comparing the two: if the average dog lives 11.5 years and the average human lives 73 years, then obviously the human lifespan is much longer. Therefore, the answer should be No, the average lifespan of a dog is not longer than that of a human.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not confusing the average with the maximum. For example, the maximum lifespan of a dog might be around 20 years for some small breeds, but that's not the average. Similarly, the maximum for humans is over 100 years, but again, that's not the average. The key here is the average, not the maximum. So sticking with the averages, the human lifespan is significantly longer than that of a dog. Therefore, the answer is No.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Determine the Average Lifespan of Dogs:**
   - Dogs vary by breed, with smaller breeds generally living longer (15–20 years) and larger breeds shorter (8–10 years).
   - Global average lifespan for all dogs is approximately **10–13 years** (midpoint ~11.5 years).

2. **Determine the Average Lifespan of Humans:**
   - Global average life expectancy at birth is **~73 years** (as of 2023, per WHO data).
   - In developed countries, this can exceed 80 years, while in some regions, it may be lower, but the global average remains ~73 years.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Dog average (~11.5 years) vs. Human average (~73 years).
   - Humans live significantly longer on average.

**Final Answer:**  
**No**, the average lifespan of a dog is not longer than that of a human.
