Okay, so the question is whether K2 is taller than Mount Everest. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two mountains. I remember that Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, but I'm not exactly sure about K2's height. I think K2 is also a very tall mountain, maybe the second highest? But I need to verify the exact numbers.

First, I should check the elevation of Mount Everest. From what I've heard, it's around 8,848 meters above sea level. I think that's the commonly cited height, but I should make sure there aren't any recent measurements that have changed that. Maybe there was a recent survey in Nepal or China that adjusted the height slightly. I recall that in 2020, there was some news about a new measurement for Everest, but I'm not sure if it's significantly different. Let me confirm: yes, the 2020 measurement by Nepal and China set the height at 8,848.86 meters. So that's the current official height.

Now, K2. I believe it's the second-highest mountain, so it should be a bit shorter than Everest. But how much shorter? I think K2 is approximately 8,611 meters tall. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Some sources might round the numbers, so I need to find the exact figure. A quick search in my memory: K2's elevation is listed as 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) by the Survey of India. However, there have been some discrepancies in the past. For example, some older sources might have different numbers, but the most recent and widely accepted measurement is 8,611 meters. 

Comparing the two: Everest is 8,848.86 meters, and K2 is 8,611 meters. Subtracting K2's height from Everest's gives 8,848.86 - 8,611 = 237.86 meters. So Everest is about 238 meters taller than K2. Therefore, the answer should be no, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest. 

Wait, but I should make sure there's no confusion with other mountains. For example, is there any other peak that's sometimes considered higher? No, the list of highest mountains starts with Everest, then K2, then Kangchenjunga, Lhotse, etc. So K2 is definitely the second-highest, which means it's shorter than Everest. 

Another point to consider: sometimes there's confusion between the highest point and the prominence or the difficulty of the climb. K2 is known as more dangerous and technically challenging, but that doesn't affect its height. So the height is a separate factor. 

I think that's all. The key numbers are Everest at 8,848.86 meters and K2 at 8,611 meters. The difference is clear, so the answer is no.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Elevation of Mount Everest:**
   - Mount Everest's official height, as determined by a 2020 joint survey by Nepal and China, is **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)** above sea level.

2. **Identify the Elevation of K2:**
   - K2, the second-highest mountain in the world, has an accepted elevation of **8,611 meters (28,251 feet)**, as per the most recent and widely recognized measurements.

3. **Compare the Two Heights:**
   - Subtract K2's elevation from Everest's:  
     **8,848.86 m (Everest) - 8,611 m (K2) = 237.86 meters.**  
     This confirms Everest is **237.86 meters taller** than K2.

4. **Contextualize the Rankings:**
   - Mount Everest is universally recognized as the tallest mountain, with K2 consistently ranked as the second-tallest. No credible data disputes this hierarchy.

**Final Answer:**  
**No**, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.
