Okay, so the question is whether Australia is larger in area than Russia. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling the approximate areas of both countries. I remember that Russia is the largest country in the world, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers. Australia is a big country too, but I think it's not as big as Russia. Wait, but maybe I should check the actual statistics to be sure.

First, I'll try to remember the area of Russia. I think it's around 17 million square kilometers. Let me see, Russia spans two continents, Europe and Asia, so that's a vast territory. Then Australia, which is a continent itself, but I believe its area is significantly smaller. I've heard that Australia is about 7.6 million square kilometers. If that's the case, then Russia is definitely larger. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think again. 

Wait, another way to approach this is to compare them to other countries. For example, the United States is about 9.8 million square kilometers. So if Russia is 17 million, that's almost double the size of the US. Australia is smaller than the US, so if the US is 9.8 million, Australia being 7.6 million would make sense. Therefore, Russia is much larger than Australia. 

But I should verify if the numbers are correct. Let me try to recall. The official area of Russia is approximately 17.1 million square kilometers. Australia's area is around 7.69 million square kilometers. So yes, Russia is more than twice the size of Australia. Therefore, the answer should be No, Australia is not larger than Russia. 

Wait, but I should also consider if there are any other factors. For example, sometimes when people talk about area, they might refer to land area versus total area (including water bodies). But in most cases, the standard area given for countries includes both land and inland water. So I think the numbers I have in mind are accurate. 

Another check: I remember that Canada is the second-largest country after Russia, with about 9.98 million square kilometers. So if Canada is almost 10 million, and Russia is 17 million, then Australia at 7.6 million is indeed smaller. 

Therefore, putting it all together, Australia's area is approximately 7.69 million square kilometers, and Russia's is about 17.1 million square kilometers. So Australia is not larger than Russia. The answer is No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Recall the approximate areas of Russia and Australia:**
   - **Russia** is the largest country in the world, spanning approximately **17.1 million square kilometers** (land and inland water).
   - **Australia** is the smallest continent and a country, with an area of roughly **7.69 million square kilometers**.

2. **Compare the two areas:**
   - Russia's area (17.1 million km²) is more than **twice** Australia's area (7.69 million km²).

3. **Cross-check with other countries for context:**
   - The **United States** is about 9.8 million km², and **Canada** is ~9.98 million km². Both are smaller than Russia but larger than Australia.
   - This reinforces that Russia is significantly larger than Australia.

4. **Clarify definitions:**
   - The standard area for countries includes **land area plus inland water bodies** (e.g., lakes, rivers). Both Russia and Australia are measured using this standard.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Australia is **not** larger in area than Russia.

**Final Answer:**  
**No**.
