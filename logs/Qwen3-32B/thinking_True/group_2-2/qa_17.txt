Okay, so the question is whether Mars has more moons than Earth. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to recall how many moons each planet has. I know Earth has one moon, the Moon. That's pretty straightforward. But what about Mars? I remember that Mars has two moons, right? Their names are Phobos and Deimos. I think they're small and irregularly shaped, maybe captured asteroids. So if Mars has two and Earth has one, then Mars would have more. But wait, am I sure about the number for Mars? Let me double-check. Sometimes I might confuse the number of moons for different planets. For example, Jupiter has a lot, like 79 or something, and Saturn even more. But Mars is smaller, so maybe just two. Yeah, I think that's right. Phobos and Deimos are the two. So Earth has one, Mars has two. Therefore, the answer should be yes. But wait, could there be any other moons that I'm not aware of? Like, maybe some small ones that are not officially recognized? I don't think so. The major ones are Phobos and Deimos. So the conclusion is that Mars has more moons than Earth. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer is yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Earth's Moons:**  
   Earth has **1** natural satellite, commonly referred to as "the Moon." This is well-established and confirmed by extensive astronomical observations.

2. **Mars' Moons:**  
   Mars has **2** confirmed natural satellites: **Phobos** and **Deimos**. These are small, irregularly shaped moons, likely captured asteroids. Their existence has been documented since their discovery in 1877 by Asaph Hall.

3. **Comparison:**  
   - Earth: 1 moon.  
   - Mars: 2 moons.  

4. **Verification of Additional Moons:**  
   While some planets (e.g., Jupiter, Saturn) have dozens of moons, Mars is not known to have any additional natural satellites beyond Phobos and Deimos. No credible evidence or official recognition of a third moon for Mars exists.

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes**, Mars has more moons than Earth.
