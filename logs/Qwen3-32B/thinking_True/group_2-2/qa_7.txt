Okay, so the question is whether a lion is faster than a cheetah. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about these animals. 

First, I remember that cheetahs are known for their speed. I think they're the fastest land animals. But wait, how fast exactly? I think cheetahs can run up to around 60-70 miles per hour. Maybe even a bit more? I'm not entirely sure, but I've heard numbers like 60-75 mph. 

Now, lions. I know they're big cats too, but they're more muscular and built for strength rather than speed. I think lions are faster than some animals but not as fast as cheetahs. Maybe around 35-40 mph? I'm not certain. I should check if my memory is correct here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the speed depends on the distance they're running. Cheetahs might be able to reach their top speed in short bursts, while lions can maintain a lower speed for longer. But the question is about who is faster, so it's probably about top speed. 

Let me try to recall some sources. I think National Geographic or similar documentaries have mentioned cheetahs as the fastest. For example, a cheetah can accelerate quickly and reach top speeds in a short sprint. Lions, on the other hand, might not need to run as fast because they often hunt in groups or rely on ambush. 

But I should also consider if there's any variation between male and female lions. Maybe females are faster? Not sure. But even if that's the case, I don't think it would surpass the cheetah's speed. 

Another angle: maybe the terrain affects their speed. Cheetahs have a more slender body and longer legs, which might help in speed. Lions are bulkier. So, in an open area, the cheetah would have the advantage. 

Wait, I should verify the exact numbers. Let me think. If I remember correctly, cheetahs can hit up to 70 mph (about 112 km/h), while lions top out around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h). That would make the cheetah significantly faster. 

But I want to make sure I'm not confusing them with other big cats. For example, leopards are faster than lions but not as fast as cheetahs. So, the hierarchy would be cheetah > leopard > lion in terms of speed. 

Also, considering that cheetahs have a more flexible spine and non-retractable claws for better traction, which aids in their speed. Lions have retractable claws and a more robust build for wrestling prey. 

So putting it all together: cheetahs are the fastest land animals, lions are not as fast. Therefore, the answer should be no, a lion is not faster than a cheetah.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Animals in Question:**  
   - **Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus):** Known for speed, often cited as the fastest land animal.  
   - **Lion (Panthera leo):** A large, muscular big cat, more built for strength and endurance than speed.  

2. **Compare Top Speeds:**  
   - **Cheetah:**  
     - Top speed: **50–75 mph (80–120 km/h)** in short bursts (typically 20–30 seconds).  
     - Adaptations: Slender body, long legs, non-retractable claws, and a flexible spine for rapid acceleration.  
   - **Lion:**  
     - Top speed: **35–40 mph (56–64 km/h)**.  
     - Adaptations: Muscular build for power, retractable claws, and a focus on ambush or group hunting rather than pure speed.  

3. **Contextual Factors:**  
   - Cheetahs rely on explosive speed to chase prey in open terrain.  
   - Lions often use stealth, teamwork, or endurance to overpower prey, reducing the need for extreme speed.  

4. **Conclusion Based on Data:**  
   Cheetahs consistently outpace lions in short-distance sprints, which is the metric for "faster" in this context.  

**Final Answer:**  
**No**, a lion is not faster than a cheetah.
