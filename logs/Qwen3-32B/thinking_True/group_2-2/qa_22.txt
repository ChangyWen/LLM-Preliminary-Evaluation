Okay, so the question is whether Canada is located south of Brazil. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling the positions of these two countries on the globe.

First, I know that Brazil is in South America. From what I remember, South America is the southern part of the continent, and Brazil is a large country there, covering a significant portion of the eastern coast. Now, Canada is in North America. North America is the northern part of the continent, right? So if Brazil is in the south and Canada is in the north, then Canada should be north of Brazil, not south. But wait, maybe I should double-check the exact positions.

Let me think about the latitudes. Latitude lines run east-west and measure how far north or south a place is from the equator. The equator is at 0 degrees, and as you go north, the latitude increases up to 90 degrees at the North Pole. Brazil is mostly in the southern hemisphere, with parts of it in the northern hemisphere. The southernmost part of Brazil is around 23 degrees south latitude, I think. Canada, on the other hand, is in the northern hemisphere. The southern part of Canada, like the southern provinces, is around 42 degrees north latitude, and the northern parts go up to the Arctic Circle, which is around 66 degrees north. So if Brazil is at 23 degrees south and Canada is at 42 degrees north, then Canada is definitely north of Brazil. Therefore, the answer should be no, Canada is not south of Brazil. Wait, but maybe I should visualize a map to be sure. If I imagine a map of the world, Brazil is in the lower part of South America, and Canada is way up in the northern part of North America. So yes, Canada is north of Brazil. Therefore, the answer is no, Canada is not south of Brazil.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Geographical Continents:**  
   - Brazil is located in **South America**.  
   - Canada is located in **North America**.  

2. **Latitude Analysis:**  
   - Brazil spans latitudes from approximately **5째N to 34째S** (mostly in the southern hemisphere).  
   - Canada spans latitudes from approximately **41째N to 83째N** (entirely in the northern hemisphere).  

3. **Relative Positioning:**  
   - Since Canada is entirely north of the equator and Brazil is mostly south of the equator, **Canada is north of Brazil**.  

4. **Map Visualization:**  
   - On a world map, Brazil occupies the eastern coast of South America, while Canada occupies the northern portion of North America. This confirms Canada is **not south of Brazil**.  

**Final Answer:**  
**No**, Canada is not located south of Brazil.
