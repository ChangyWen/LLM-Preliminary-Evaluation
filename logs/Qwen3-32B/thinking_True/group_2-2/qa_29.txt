Okay, so the question is whether the wavelength of blue light is longer than that of red light. Hmm, I need to remember what I learned about the electromagnetic spectrum. Let me think. I recall that different colors of light correspond to different wavelengths. The visible spectrum ranges from red to violet, right? Red is on one end, and violet is on the other. But wait, which one has the longer wavelength?

I think red light has a longer wavelength. Because in the spectrum, red is at the lower frequency end, and violet is at the higher frequency end. Wait, but frequency and wavelength are inversely related. So if red has a lower frequency, its wavelength must be longer. Because the formula is speed of light equals frequency times wavelength (c = λν). So if frequency is lower, wavelength has to be longer to keep the product the same. 

So blue light is towards the higher frequency end. Higher frequency means shorter wavelength. So blue has a shorter wavelength than red. Therefore, the answer should be no, blue's wavelength is not longer than red's. Let me check if I'm mixing up anything. Maybe I should recall the order of colors in the visible spectrum. The acronym ROYGBIV: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. From longest to shortest wavelength. So red is first, longest wavelength, then orange, yellow, etc., with violet being the shortest. So blue comes after green, before indigo and violet. So blue's wavelength is shorter than red's. Therefore, the answer is no.

The wavelength of blue light is **not** longer than that of red light. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Visible Spectrum Order:** The visible light spectrum is ordered by wavelength from longest to shortest as: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet (ROYGBIV).
2. **Wavelength Relationship:** Red light has the longest wavelength (~620–750 nm), while blue light has a shorter wavelength (~450–495 nm).
3. **Frequency and Wavelength Inverse Relationship:** Since $ c = \lambda \nu $ (where $ c $ is the speed of light, $ \lambda $ is wavelength, and $ \nu $ is frequency), higher frequency corresponds to shorter wavelength. Blue light has a higher frequency than red light, confirming its shorter wavelength.

**Final Answer:** No.
