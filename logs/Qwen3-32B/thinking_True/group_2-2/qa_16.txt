Okay, so the question is whether the freezing point of water is higher than the boiling point of water. Hmm, let me think. I remember from school that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius and boils at 100 degrees Celsius. Wait, so if freezing is at 0°C and boiling is at 100°C, then the freezing point is lower than the boiling point. So the answer should be no, right? But let me make sure I'm not mixing up the numbers.

Let me visualize a thermometer. When it's cold, water turns to ice at 0°C. As it gets warmer, it stays liquid until it reaches 100°C, where it starts to boil and turn into steam. So 0 is definitely lower than 100. Therefore, the freezing point is not higher; it's lower. So the answer is no. But wait, maybe they're talking about Fahrenheit? In Fahrenheit, water freezes at 32°F and boils at 212°F. Still, 32 is less than 212. So regardless of the temperature scale, the freezing point is lower than the boiling point. So the answer is no, the freezing point is not higher than the boiling point. I think that's right. I don't see any exceptions here. Maybe under pressure? But the question doesn't mention pressure, so I assume it's at standard atmospheric pressure. Yeah, so the answer is no.

The freezing point of water is **not** higher than the boiling point of water. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Standard Conditions**: At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), water freezes at **0°C (32°F)** and boils at **100°C (212°F)**.  
2. **Comparison**:  
   - Freezing point: 0°C (32°F)  
   - Boiling point: 100°C (212°F)  
   - Numerically, **0°C < 100°C** and **32°F < 212°F**.  
3. **Conclusion**: The freezing point is **lower** than the boiling point in both Celsius and Fahrenheit scales.  

**Final Answer**: **No**.
