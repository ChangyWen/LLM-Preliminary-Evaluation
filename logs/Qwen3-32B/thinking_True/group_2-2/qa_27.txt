Okay, so the question is asking whether the boiling point of water is lower than the melting point of ice. Hmm, let me think. First, I need to recall the standard temperatures for these phase changes. I remember that the melting point of ice is 0 degrees Celsius. That's when ice turns into water. And the boiling point of water is when it turns into vapor, right? I think that's 100 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure. Wait, so if the melting point is 0°C and the boiling point is 100°C, then the boiling point is actually higher than the melting point. So the answer should be no, the boiling point isn't lower. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up anything. Maybe there's some pressure consideration? Like, if the pressure is different, the boiling point can change. But the question doesn't mention pressure, so I assume it's at standard pressure. Yeah, under normal conditions, water boils at 100°C and melts at 0°C. So the boiling point is definitely higher. Therefore, the answer is no.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Melting Point of Ice:**
   - The melting point of ice (solid to liquid) at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm) is **0°C (32°F)**.

2. **Identify the Boiling Point of Water:**
   - The boiling point of water (liquid to gas) at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm) is **100°C (212°F)**.

3. **Compare the Two Temperatures:**
   - **0°C (melting point)** is **lower** than **100°C (boiling point)**.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the boiling point of water (100°C) is **higher** than the melting point of ice (0°C), the statement "the boiling point of water is lower than the melting point of ice" is **false**.

**Final Answer:**  
**No.**
