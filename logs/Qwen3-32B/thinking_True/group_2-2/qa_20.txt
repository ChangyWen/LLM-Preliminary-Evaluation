Okay, so the question is whether the atomic number of carbon is higher than that of oxygen. Let me think through this step by step. First, I need to recall what atomic number means. The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element. So, each element has a unique atomic number.

Now, I need to remember the positions of carbon and oxygen in the periodic table. Carbon is a well-known element, and I think it's in group 14. Oxygen is in group 16, I believe. But maybe I should think about their positions in terms of periods. Carbon is in the second period, and oxygen is also in the second period. Wait, but how does that affect their atomic numbers?

Let me try to list the elements in the second period to see their order. The second period starts with lithium (Li), then beryllium (Be), boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and neon (Ne). So, carbon comes before oxygen in the second period. Since the atomic number increases as you move from left to right across a period, carbon would have a lower atomic number than oxygen.

Wait, let me confirm the atomic numbers. Carbon's atomic number is 6 because it has 6 protons. Oxygen's atomic number is 8 because it has 8 protons. So, 6 is less than 8. Therefore, carbon's atomic number is not higher than oxygen's. 

But maybe I should double-check to make sure I haven't mixed up the order. Let me think of another way. The elements in the second period go from atomic number 3 (lithium) up to 10 (neon). Carbon is the fourth element in that period (Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne). So, carbon is the 6th element? Wait, lithium is 3, beryllium 4, boron 5, carbon 6, nitrogen 7, oxygen 8. Yes, that's right. So carbon is 6, oxygen is 8. Therefore, carbon's atomic number is lower than oxygen's. 

I think that's correct. So the answer should be no, the atomic number of carbon is not higher than that of oxygen.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Definition of Atomic Number:**  
   The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in its nucleus. It determines the element's position in the periodic table.

2. **Locate Carbon and Oxygen in the Periodic Table:**  
   - **Carbon (C)** is in the **second period** and **Group 14**.  
   - **Oxygen (O)** is in the **second period** and **Group 16**.  

3. **Order of Elements in the Second Period:**  
   The second period elements (from left to right) are:  
   **Lithium (3), Beryllium (4), Boron (5), Carbon (6), Nitrogen (7), Oxygen (8), Fluorine (9), Neon (10)**.  

4. **Compare Atomic Numbers:**  
   - Carbon has an atomic number of **6**.  
   - Oxygen has an atomic number of **8**.  

5. **Conclusion:**  
   Since **6 (Carbon) < 8 (Oxygen)**, the atomic number of carbon is **not higher** than that of oxygen.  

**Final Answer:**  
**No**.
