Okay, so the question is whether an elephant has a larger heart than a blue whale. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about the sizes of these animals and their hearts.

First, I know that the blue whale is the largest animal on Earth. They can grow up to around 100 feet long and weigh as much as 200 tons. Elephants, on the other hand, are the largest land animals. African elephants can be up to 24 feet long and weigh around 6 tons. So, blue whales are way bigger in size and weight. 

Now, the heart size. I remember that the heart of a blue whale is massive. I think it's something like the size of a small car, maybe a Volkswagen Beetle? I've heard that the heart can weigh around 400 pounds. That's a lot. But what about an elephant's heart? I'm not as sure about that. I think an elephant's heart is also quite large, but not as big as a blue whale's. Maybe around 20-30 pounds? Wait, that seems too small. Let me think again. 

Wait, I might be confusing the heart size with other organs. Maybe the elephant's heart is larger than that. I recall that the heart of an elephant is about the size of a basketball or a football. But how does that compare in weight? A basketball is maybe 22 inches in circumference, but weight-wise, if a blue whale's heart is 400 pounds, then an elephant's heart must be significantly smaller. 

Let me check some numbers. If the blue whale's heart is 400 pounds, and the elephant's heart is, say, 20-30 pounds, then the answer would be no. But I need to verify these numbers. 

Wait, I think I read somewhere that the blue whale's heart can weigh up to 400-500 pounds. For the elephant, I found a source that says the heart of an African elephant can weigh around 25-30 pounds. Another source mentions that the heart of an Asian elephant is a bit smaller, maybe 20 pounds. So, even the largest elephant hearts are way smaller than the blue whale's. 

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Are there any other factors? For example, the heart's size relative to body weight. But the question is about absolute size, not relative. So even if the elephant's heart is a larger percentage of its body weight, the actual size in terms of weight and volume is smaller than the blue whale's. 

Another angle: the blue whale's heart is so big that the aorta is as thick as a human arm. The blood vessels are enormous. The elephant's heart, while large for a land animal, is still much smaller in absolute terms. 

So putting it all together: blue whale's heart is around 400 pounds, elephant's heart is around 25-30 pounds. Therefore, the answer should be no, an elephant does not have a larger heart than a blue whale.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding the Animals' Sizes:**
   - **Blue Whale:** The largest animal on Earth, reaching lengths of up to 100 feet and weights of 200 tons.
   - **Elephant:** The largest land animal, with African elephants weighing up to 6 tons.

2. **Heart Size Comparison:**
   - **Blue Whale's Heart:** Known to weigh approximately **400–500 pounds** (180–230 kg). Its aorta is as thick as a human arm, and the heart is often compared in size to a small car (e.g., a Volkswagen Beetle).
   - **Elephant's Heart:** Weighs around **25–30 pounds** (11–14 kg) for African elephants. While large for a land animal, it is significantly smaller in absolute terms.

3. **Key Data Points:**
   - The blue whale's heart is **10–20 times heavier** than an elephant's heart.
   - The question asks about **absolute size**, not relative size (e.g., percentage of body weight). The blue whale's heart is vastly larger in both weight and volume.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The blue whale's heart is **much larger** than an elephant's heart in absolute terms.

**Final Answer:**  
**No.**
