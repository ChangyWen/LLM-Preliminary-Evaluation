Okay, so the question is whether an elephant is heavier than a blue whale. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about the weights of these two animals.

First, elephants. I remember that elephants are the largest land animals. There are different species, like African elephants and Asian elephants. I think African elephants are bigger. From what I've heard, an adult African elephant can weigh around 5,000 to 6,000 kilograms. Maybe even more? I'm not exactly sure, but I think the average is somewhere in that range. Let me check that in my mind. Yeah, I've seen documentaries where they mention that a male African elephant can reach up to 6,000 kg. So, let's say the maximum weight for an elephant is around 6,000 kg.

Now, blue whales. Oh, blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, right? They live in the ocean. I remember that their size is absolutely massive. I think the blue whale's weight is in the range of tens of thousands of kilograms. Wait, I think I've heard numbers like 150,000 kg or even more. Let me think. The blue whale's length is about 30 meters, and their weight is something like 170 tons. Wait, tons can be metric tons or short tons. A metric ton is 1,000 kg. So if a blue whale is 170 metric tons, that's 170,000 kg. That seems right. I think the average weight is around 150,000 to 180,000 kg. 

So comparing the two: the heaviest elephant is about 6,000 kg, and the blue whale is 150,000 kg or more. That's a huge difference. So the blue whale is way heavier than the elephant. Therefore, the answer should be no, an elephant is not heavier than a blue whale. 

Wait, but maybe I should double-check the numbers. Let me try to recall. For elephants, the African bush elephant is the largest. The maximum weight is around 6,000 kg. The Asian elephant is smaller, maybe 5,000 kg. But even the largest elephant is nowhere near the weight of a blue whale. 

Blue whales, being the largest animals ever to have existed, their weight is definitely in the hundreds of thousands of kilograms. The heaviest recorded blue whale was around 190,000 kg. So even the heaviest elephant is about 6,000 kg, which is way less than 190,000 kg. 

Therefore, the answer is no. An elephant is not heavier than a blue whale. The blue whale is significantly heavier.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Animals in Question:**
   - **Elephant:** The largest land animal, with the African bush elephant being the heaviest species.
   - **Blue Whale:** The largest animal on Earth, living in the ocean.

2. **Determine Average Weights:**
   - **Elephant (African Bush):** 
     - Average weight: 4,000–6,000 kg (8,800–13,200 lbs).
     - Maximum recorded weight: ~6,000 kg (13,200 lbs).
   - **Blue Whale:**
     - Average weight: 150,000–180,000 kg (330,000–396,000 lbs).
     - Maximum recorded weight: ~190,000 kg (418,000 lbs).

3. **Compare the Weights:**
   - The heaviest elephant (~6,000 kg) is **25–30 times lighter** than the lightest blue whale (~150,000 kg).
   - Even the largest recorded blue whale (190,000 kg) is **31 times heavier** than the heaviest elephant.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The blue whale is **significantly heavier** than any elephant species.

**Final Answer:**  
**No**, an elephant is not heavier than a blue whale.
