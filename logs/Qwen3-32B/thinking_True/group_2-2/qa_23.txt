Okay, so the question is whether the pH of water is lower than that of lemon juice. Let me think through this step by step. First, I need to recall what pH means. pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. The scale goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Anything below 7 is acidic, and above 7 is basic.

Now, pure water is neutral, right? So its pH should be around 7. But wait, sometimes people might be referring to tap water or distilled water. I think distilled water is considered neutral, so pH 7. But maybe tap water can vary slightly depending on minerals and other substances, but generally, it's close to 7.

Then there's lemon juice. I know that lemon juice is acidic because it's a citrus fruit. The citric acid in lemons makes them sour. So lemon juice should have a pH lower than 7. How low exactly? I remember that common substances like vinegar have a pH around 2-3, and lemon juice is even more acidic. Maybe around 2? Let me check my memory. Yes, I think lemon juice is about pH 2. So if water is pH 7 and lemon juice is pH 2, then the pH of water is higher than that of lemon juice. Wait, the question is asking if the pH of water is lower than lemon juice. So if water is 7 and lemon is 2, then 7 is higher than 2, so the answer would be no, water's pH is not lower than lemon juice. 

But wait, could there be any exceptions? For example, if the water is not pure. If the water is distilled, it's 7. But if it's something else, like maybe if it's been sitting out and absorbed CO2, making it slightly acidic? But even then, the pH would be maybe around 5.6 due to carbonic acid formation. But that's still higher than lemon juice's pH of 2. So even in that case, water's pH is higher. 

Another angle: sometimes people confuse pH with alkalinity. But no, pH is a direct measure. So unless the water is somehow basic, which would be pH above 7, but the question is about water's pH being lower than lemon juice. So unless the water is more acidic than lemon juice, which I don't think is the case. 

So putting it all together: water (pH ~7) vs lemon juice (pH ~2). Since 7 is higher than 2, the pH of water is higher, not lower. Therefore, the answer is no.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding pH Scale:**  
   - The pH scale ranges from 0 (highly acidic) to 14 (highly basic), with 7 being neutral.  
   - Substances with pH < 7 are acidic; those with pH > 7 are basic.

2. **pH of Pure Water:**  
   - Pure water (distilled or deionized) is neutral, with a pH of **7**.  
   - Tap water may vary slightly (e.g., 6.5–7.5) due to dissolved minerals or CO₂, but it remains close to neutral.

3. **pH of Lemon Juice:**  
   - Lemon juice contains citric acid, making it highly acidic.  
   - Its pH is typically **~2**, significantly lower than neutral water.

4. **Comparison:**  
   - Water (pH ~7) is **less acidic** than lemon juice (pH ~2).  
   - A lower pH indicates higher acidity, so lemon juice is more acidic than water.

5. **Exceptions Considered:**  
   - Even if water absorbs CO₂ (forming carbonic acid), its pH drops to ~5.6, still higher than lemon juice.  
   - No common form of water is more acidic than lemon juice.

**Final Answer:**  
**No.** The pH of water (typically ~7) is **higher** than that of lemon juice (~2), meaning water is less acidic.
