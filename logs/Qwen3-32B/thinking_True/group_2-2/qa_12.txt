Okay, so the question is whether the British Empire existed before the Roman Empire. Let me start by recalling what I know about both empires.

First, the Roman Empire. I remember that the Roman Republic was established around 509 BCE, and then it became an empire in 27 BCE when Augustus became the first emperor. The Roman Empire lasted for a long time, with the Western Roman Empire falling in 476 CE and the Eastern (Byzantine) Empire lasting until 1453. So the Roman Empire definitely existed from at least 27 BCE onward.

Now, the British Empire. I think the British Empire as a formal entity started much later. The United Kingdom itself was formed in 1707 with the Acts of Union between England and Scotland. Before that, there was the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland. The British Empire's expansion began in the 16th and 17th centuries with colonies in the Americas, the Caribbean, and later in Africa and Asia. So the British Empire as a global empire really took off in the 1600s and 1700s.

Wait, but maybe there were earlier forms of British presence or influence? For example, the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 CE. The Romans occupied parts of what is now England and Wales for about 400 years until the 5th century. But that was under the Roman Empire, not the British Empire. The British Empire as we know it didn't exist during Roman times. The concept of a British Empire came much later, after the Romans left and after the formation of the United Kingdom.

So putting this together: the Roman Empire existed from 27 BCE, while the British Empire as a formal entity started in the 17th century. Therefore, the British Empire did not exist before the Roman Empire. The answer should be No.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Roman Empire Timeline:**
   - The Roman Republic was established in **509 BCE**.
   - The Roman Empire was officially founded in **27 BCE** when Augustus became the first emperor.
   - The Western Roman Empire fell in **476 CE**, while the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) lasted until **1453 CE**.

2. **British Empire Timeline:**
   - The concept of a "British Empire" emerged much later. The United Kingdom was formed in **1707** through the Acts of Union between England and Scotland.
   - The British Empire's global expansion began in the **16th and 17th centuries** with colonies in the Americas, Caribbean, and later Africa and Asia.
   - The formal structure of the British Empire as a global power did not exist during the Roman Empire's reign.

3. **Key Distinction:**
   - The Roman Empire included parts of Britain (conquered in **43 CE**), but this was under Roman rule, not a precursor to the British Empire.
   - The British Empire as a distinct entity did not exist until centuries after the Roman Empire's decline.

**Final Answer:**  
**No.** The British Empire did not exist before the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire predates the British Empire by over 1,700 years.
