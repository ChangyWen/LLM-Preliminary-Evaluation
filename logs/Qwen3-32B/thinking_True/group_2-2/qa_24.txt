Okay, so the question is whether a day on Earth lasts longer than a day on Venus. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what a day means. A day is the time it takes for a planet to complete one full rotation on its axis. So, I need to compare the rotation periods of Earth and Venus.

First, I know that Earth's day is 24 hours. That's pretty straightforward. But what about Venus? I remember that Venus has a very slow rotation. Wait, isn't it also retrograde? Meaning it rotates in the opposite direction to most planets. But how long is its day?

I think Venus has a very long day. Let me try to remember. I've heard that a day on Venus is longer than its year. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the year is the time it takes to orbit the Sun, and the day is the rotation period. So if Venus's day is longer than its year, that would mean it takes longer to spin once than to go around the Sun once. But I need to check the actual numbers.

Let me think. Earth's rotation period is about 24 hours. Venus's rotation period... I think it's something like 243 Earth days. Wait, that sounds familiar. So if Venus takes 243 Earth days to rotate once, then a day on Venus is indeed much longer than a day on Earth. But wait, is that correct? Because I also remember that Venus's orbital period around the Sun is about 225 Earth days. So if its day is 243 days, then yes, a day on Venus is longer than its year. That seems counterintuitive, but I think that's the case.

So, if Earth's day is 24 hours and Venus's day is 243 Earth days, then obviously a day on Earth is much shorter. Therefore, the answer would be yes, a day on Earth is shorter than a day on Venus. Wait, but the question is phrased as "Does a day on Earth last longer than a day on Venus?" So if Earth's day is 24 hours and Venus's is 243 days, then Earth's day is shorter. Therefore, the answer would be no, a day on Earth does not last longer than a day on Venus. Wait, but I need to be careful here. Let me confirm the numbers again.

Earth's rotation period (sidereal day) is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.0916 seconds. But the solar day, which is what we commonly refer to as a day, is 24 hours. Venus's rotation period is indeed about 243 Earth days. However, because Venus rotates in the opposite direction, the solar day on Venus is actually shorter. Wait, that complicates things. Let me clarify.

The sidereal day is the time it takes for a planet to rotate once relative to the distant stars. The solar day is the time between two noons (when the Sun is at its highest point in the sky). For planets that rotate in the same direction as their orbit (prograde), the solar day is longer than the sidereal day. But for Venus, which has a retrograde rotation, the solar day is actually shorter than the sidereal day. Wait, so what's the solar day on Venus?

I think the solar day on Venus is about 116.75 Earth days. So if we're talking about the solar day, which is the time from one sunrise to the next, then Venus's solar day is about 116.75 Earth days. But the sidereal day is 243 Earth days. So depending on which definition of a day we're using, the answer might differ. The question doesn't specify, but generally, when people refer to a day, they mean the solar day. However, in astronomical terms, the sidereal day is also a valid measure.

But the question is about which day is longer. If we take the sidereal day, Venus's day is 243 Earth days, which is way longer than Earth's 24 hours. If we take the solar day, Venus's day is 116.75 Earth days, which is still longer than Earth's 24 hours. Therefore, regardless of which definition we use, a day on Venus is longer than a day on Earth. Therefore, the answer is no, a day on Earth does not last longer than a day on Venus. The answer is yes, Venus's day is longer. Wait, the question is phrased as "Does a day on Earth last longer than a day on Venus?" So if Earth's day is shorter, then the answer is no. Wait, let me make sure.

If the question is asking whether Earth's day is longer than Venus's day, and Venus's day is longer, then the answer is no. So the correct answer is no. But I need to confirm the exact numbers again to be sure.

Earth's solar day: 24 hours.

Venus's solar day: approximately 116.75 Earth days.

Venus's sidereal day: approximately 243 Earth days.

So regardless of which one we use, Venus's day is longer. Therefore, the answer is no, a day on Earth does not last longer than a day on Venus. The answer is no.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Definition of a Day:**  
   A day is the time it takes for a planet to complete one full rotation on its axis. There are two types:  
   - **Sidereal Day:** Rotation relative to distant stars.  
   - **Solar Day:** Time between two noons (Sun's highest point in the sky).  

2. **Earth's Day:**  
   - **Sidereal Day:** ~23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0916 seconds.  
   - **Solar Day:** 24 hours (commonly used).  

3. **Venus's Rotation:**  
   - Venus rotates **retrograde** (opposite to most planets).  
   - **Sidereal Day:** ~243 Earth days (longest in the Solar System).  
   - **Solar Day:** ~116.75 Earth days (shorter than the sidereal day due to retrograde rotation).  

4. **Comparison:**  
   - **Sidereal Day:** Venus (243 days) > Earth (24 hours).  
   - **Solar Day:** Venus (116.75 days) > Earth (24 hours).  

5. **Conclusion:**  
   Regardless of the definition (sidereal or solar), a day on Venus is significantly longer than a day on Earth.  

**Final Answer:**  
**No**, a day on Earth does not last longer than a day on Venus.
