Okay, so the question is asking whether the discovery of the DNA structure happened before the discovery of penicillin. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to recall when each of these discoveries was made. Penicillin is an antibiotic, right? I remember that Alexander Fleming discovered it. I think that was in the early 20th century. Maybe around the 1920s or 1930s? Wait, wasn't it in 1928? Yeah, I think that's right. Fleming noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum killed bacteria in a petri dish. So penicillin's discovery was in 1928.

Now, DNA structure. The structure of DNA was determined by James Watson and Francis Crick. They proposed the double helix model. I believe that was in the 1950s. Specifically, 1953. They published their paper in Nature in April 1953. So DNA structure was discovered in 1953.

Comparing the two dates: Penicillin in 1928 and DNA in 1953. So penicillin was discovered first, and DNA structure came later. Therefore, the answer should be No, the DNA structure was not discovered before penicillin. Penicillin was discovered first, so the DNA structure discovery was after.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Penicillin Discovery:**  
   - Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in **1928**. This was a groundbreaking moment in medicine as the first widely used antibiotic.

2. **DNA Structure Discovery:**  
   - The double-helix structure of DNA was elucidated by James Watson and Francis Crick in **1953**, with critical contributions from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. This discovery revolutionized molecular biology.

3. **Chronological Comparison:**  
   - Penicillin (1928) predates the DNA structure (1953) by **25 years**.

**Final Answer:**  
No.
