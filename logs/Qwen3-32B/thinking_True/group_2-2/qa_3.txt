Okay, so the question is whether Isaac Newton died later than Albert Einstein. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to recall the dates of death for both scientists. I know that Isaac Newton was a famous physicist and mathematician from the 17th and 18th centuries. He was born in 1643, I believe, and died in the early 18th century. Wait, wasn't he born in 1643 and died in 1727? That seems right. So Newton died in 1727.

Now, Albert Einstein was a 20th-century physicist, known for the theory of relativity. He was born in 1879 and died in 1955. So Einstein died in 1955.

Comparing the two dates: Newton died in 1727, Einstein in 1955. Since 1727 is earlier than 1955, Newton died before Einstein. Therefore, the answer should be No, because Newton did not die later than Einstein; he died much earlier.

Wait, let me double-check the dates to make sure I didn't mix them up. Newton's death date is commonly cited as March 31, 1727 (Gregorian calendar), which is the same as March 20, 1727, in the Julian calendar he was using at the time. Einstein's death date is April 18, 1955. So yes, 1727 is definitely before 1955. So the answer is No.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Isaac Newton's death date:**  
   - Isaac Newton died on **March 31, 1727** (Gregorian calendar).  

2. **Identify Albert Einstein's death date:**  
   - Albert Einstein died on **April 18, 1955**.  

3. **Compare the dates:**  
   - 1727 (Newton's death year) is **earlier** than 1955 (Einstein's death year).  

**Conclusion:**  
Isaac Newton died **before** Albert Einstein.  

**Final Answer:**  
**No**.
