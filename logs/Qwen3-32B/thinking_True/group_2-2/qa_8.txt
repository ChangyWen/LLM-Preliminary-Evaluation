Okay, so the question is whether the Gobi Desert is hotter than the Sahara Desert. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two deserts.

First, the Sahara Desert is the largest hot desert in the world, right? It's in Africa, covering countries like Egypt, Sudan, Algeria, and others. I remember that the Sahara is known for extremely high temperatures. I think the highest temperature ever recorded in the Sahara was something like 58°C (136°F) in Libya, though I'm not 100% sure about the exact number. But that's definitely a very high temperature.

Now, the Gobi Desert. I know it's in Asia, mainly in China and Mongolia. It's a cold desert, I think. Wait, cold desert? So, unlike the Sahara, which is a hot desert, the Gobi is a cold desert. That might mean it has lower temperatures, especially in winter. But what about summer? How hot does it get there?

I should check the average summer temperatures. The Sahara's summer temperatures can be around 30-40°C (86-104°F) during the day, but they can spike much higher. The Gobi, being a cold desert, probably has lower summer temperatures. Maybe around 20-30°C (68-86°F)? But I'm not certain. I should verify if the Gobi ever reaches the same high temperatures as the Sahara.

Also, the Gobi is more continental, so it might have more extreme temperature variations between day and night. But the question is about how hot it gets, not the overall temperature range. So the maximum temperatures in the Gobi versus the Sahara.

Wait, I think the Gobi's highest recorded temperature is lower than the Sahara's. For example, maybe the Gobi's highest is around 45°C (113°F), but I'm not sure. If that's the case, then the Sahara is hotter. But I need to confirm these numbers.

Another angle: the Sahara is a subtropical desert, which typically has higher temperatures. The Gobi is a mid-latitude desert, which tends to be colder. So the Sahara's climate is more about intense heat, while the Gobi's is more about cold winters and moderate summers. So in terms of maximum temperatures, the Sahara would be hotter.

But I should also consider that the Gobi might have some areas that get very hot. However, overall, the Sahara's average and maximum temperatures are higher. So the answer is probably no, the Gobi isn't hotter than the Sahara. The Sahara is hotter.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding the Deserts:**
   - **Sahara Desert:** Located in Africa, it is the largest **hot desert** in the world. Known for extreme heat, with recorded temperatures up to **58°C (136°F)**.
   - **Gobi Desert:** Located in Asia (China and Mongolia), it is a **cold desert**. Cold deserts experience colder winters and generally lower summer temperatures compared to hot deserts.

2. **Temperature Comparisons:**
   - **Sahara:** 
     - Summer daytime temperatures often range from **30–40°C (86–104°F)**, with spikes exceeding **50°C (122°F)**.
     - The highest recorded temperature in the Sahara is **58°C (136°F)** in Libya (1922).
   - **Gobi:** 
     - Summer temperatures are milder, typically **20–30°C (68–86°F)**.
     - The highest recorded temperature in the Gobi is **45°C (113°F)** (e.g., in Xinjiang, China).

3. **Climate Type:**
   - The Sahara is a **subtropical desert**, characterized by intense heat and aridity.
   - The Gobi is a **mid-latitude desert**, with colder winters and less extreme summer heat due to its continental climate.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The Sahara Desert consistently experiences **higher maximum temperatures** than the Gobi Desert. Even the Gobi's highest recorded temperature (45°C) is significantly lower than the Sahara's (58°C).

**Final Answer:**  
**No**, the Gobi Desert is not hotter than the Sahara Desert. The Sahara is hotter.
