<think>
Okay, so the question is whether a day on Venus lasts longer than a day on Earth. Let me think through this step by step. First, I need to recall what defines a day on a planet. A day is the time it takes for the planet to complete one full rotation on its axis. But wait, there's a difference between a solar day and a sidereal day. A solar day is the time from one noon to the next, which is what we usually refer to as a day. A sidereal day is the time it takes for the planet to rotate once relative to the distant stars. I think for Earth, the solar day is about 24 hours, and the sidereal day is slightly shorter, around 23 hours and 56 minutes. But for Venus, I'm not sure. 

I remember that Venus has a very slow rotation. In fact, it's the slowest of all the terrestrial planets. I think it takes about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis. But wait, that's the sidereal day, right? Because Venus also has a retrograde rotation, meaning it spins in the opposite direction to most planets. So, if Venus takes 243 Earth days to rotate once, but it's also orbiting the Sun, how does that affect the solar day?

Let me try to calculate the solar day for Venus. The formula for the solar day is 1/(1/sidereal day - 1/orbital period). But since Venus has a retrograde rotation, the orbital period would be subtracted differently. Wait, the formula might be different. Let me think. The solar day is the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky. For a prograde rotation (same direction as orbit), the solar day is longer than the sidereal day. For a retrograde rotation, the solar day would be shorter? Or longer?

Wait, Venus's orbital period around the Sun is about 225 Earth days. So if it takes 243 days to rotate once (sidereal day) and orbits the Sun in 225 days, then the solar day would be calculated as follows. The formula for the solar day when the rotation is in the same direction as the orbit is 1/(1/sidereal day - 1/orbital period). But since Venus rotates in the opposite direction, the formula would be 1/(1/sidereal day + 1/orbital period). Let me check that. 

So, if the planet is rotating in the same direction as its orbit, the solar day is longer because the planet has to rotate a bit more to catch up with the Sun's position. If it's rotating in the opposite direction, then the solar day would be shorter because the rotation and orbit are working against each other. 

So plugging in the numbers: Venus's sidereal day is 243 Earth days, and its orbital period is 225 Earth days. Using the formula for retrograde rotation: 1/(1/243 + 1/225). Let me compute that. 

First, find 1/243 ≈ 0.004115226 and 1/225 ≈ 0.004444444. Adding them together gives approximately 0.00855967. Then take the reciprocal: 1 / 0.00855967 ≈ 116.8 days. So the solar day on Venus is about 116.8 Earth days. 

Comparing that to Earth's solar day of 24 hours, which is much shorter. Therefore, a day on Venus (solar day) is longer than a day on Earth? Wait, no. Wait, 116.8 Earth days is way longer than 24 hours. So yes, a day on Venus is longer than a day on Earth. 

But wait, I need to confirm if the solar day is indeed 116.8 Earth days. Let me check my calculation again. 

The formula for the solar day when rotation is retrograde is 1/(1/sidereal day + 1/orbital period). So 1/(1/243 + 1/225). Let me compute the denominators. 

Convert 1/243 and 1/225 to decimal:

1/243 ≈ 0.004115226

1/225 ≈ 0.004444444

Adding them: 0.004115226 + 0.004444444 ≈ 0.00855967

Then 1 / 0.00855967 ≈ 116.8. So that's correct. 

Therefore, the solar day on Venus is approximately 116.8 Earth days. Since Earth's day is 1 day, Venus's day is longer. So the answer is yes. 

But wait, I should also check if there's any other way this is calculated. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. 

The general formula for the solar day is:

Solar day = 1 / ( (1/sidereal day) - (1/orbital period) )

But the sign depends on the direction of rotation. If the rotation is prograde (same as orbital direction), then the solar day is longer. If retrograde, the formula becomes:

Solar day = 1 / ( (1/sidereal day) + (1/orbital period) )

Which is what I used. So with Venus's sidereal day of 243 days and orbital period of 225 days, adding the reciprocals gives the correct solar day. 

Therefore, the solar day on Venus is about 116.8 Earth days, which is indeed longer than Earth's 24-hour day. So the answer is yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Definition of a Day:**  
   A day on a planet is defined as the **solar day**—the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky (e.g., from noon to noon). This differs from the **sidereal day** (rotation relative to distant stars).

2. **Venus's Rotation and Orbit:**  
   - **Sidereal Day:** Venus takes **243 Earth days** to complete one rotation on its axis (retrograde, i.e., opposite to most planets).  
   - **Orbital Period:** Venus orbits the Sun in **225 Earth days**.  

3. **Solar Day Calculation for Retrograde Rotation:**  
   For planets with retrograde rotation, the solar day is calculated using:  
   $$
   \text{Solar Day} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{\text{Sidereal Day}} + \frac{1}{\text{Orbital Period}}\right)}
   $$  
   Plugging in Venus's values:  
   $$
   \text{Solar Day} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{243} + \frac{1}{225}\right)} \approx \frac{1}{0.00856} \approx 116.8 \, \text{Earth days}.
   $$

4. **Comparison to Earth:**  
   - Earth's solar day is **1 Earth day (24 hours)**.  
   - Venus's solar day is **~116.8 Earth days**, which is significantly longer.

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes**, a day on Venus (116.8 Earth days) lasts longer than a day on Earth (1 Earth day).
