Okay, so the question is whether a peregrine falcon is faster than an eagle. Let me start by recalling what I know about these birds. Both are birds of prey, right? But I think the peregrine falcon is known for being really fast. I remember something about them diving at high speeds. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers.

First, I need to find out the top speeds of both the peregrine falcon and the eagle. Let me think. The peregrine falcon's speed is often cited as the fastest in a dive. I think it's around 200 mph or more. Wait, I've heard numbers like 240 mph in a dive. But when they're flying level, maybe they're not as fast. 

Now, for the eagle. There are different types of eagles, like the bald eagle or the golden eagle. I'm not sure if their speeds are similar. I think eagles are more known for their strength and size rather than speed. Maybe their diving speed is lower than the peregrine's. Let me try to remember. I think the golden eagle's diving speed is around 150 mph. But I'm not certain. 

Wait, maybe I should check if there's a specific type of eagle being referred to here. The question just says "eagle," so maybe it's the most commonly compared one. The bald eagle, perhaps? I think the bald eagle's speed is lower. Maybe around 30-40 mph in level flight and maybe 100 mph in a dive. But I'm not sure. 

So, if the peregrine falcon can reach 240 mph in a dive, and the eagle's maximum is maybe 150 mph, then yes, the peregrine is faster. But I need to confirm these numbers. Let me think if there are any sources I can recall. I remember that the peregrine falcon holds the record for the fastest bird in a dive. The exact number might be around 240 mph (390 km/h). For the eagle, the golden eagle's diving speed is often cited as up to 150 mph (240 km/h), but I might be mixing up the units. Wait, 150 mph is about 240 km/h. So if the peregrine is 240 mph, that's higher than the eagle's 150 mph. 

But wait, maybe the eagle's speed is in a different unit. Let me check. If the golden eagle's speed is 150 mph, that's 241 km/h. The peregrine's is 240 mph, which is 386 km/h. So yes, the peregrine is faster. 

But I should also consider level flight speeds. The peregrine's level flight is maybe 30-40 mph, while the eagle's might be similar. But the question is about speed in general, so the maximum speed would be in a dive. Therefore, the answer would be yes, the peregrine falcon is faster than an eagle.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Birds in Question:**
   - **Peregrine Falcon:** Known for being the fastest bird in the world, particularly during a dive (stoop).
   - **Eagle:** A general term for large birds of prey, with species like the Golden Eagle and Bald Eagle. The question does not specify a particular species, so we consider the fastest known eagle (Golden Eagle).

2. **Compare Maximum Speeds:**
   - **Peregrine Falcon:**
     - **Diving Speed:** 240–242 mph (390–390 km/h) – this is the fastest recorded speed for any bird.
     - **Level Flight Speed:** 30–40 mph (48–64 km/h).
   - **Golden Eagle (Fastest Eagle):**
     - **Diving Speed:** 150–160 mph (240–257 km/h).
     - **Level Flight Speed:** 30–35 mph (48–56 km/h).

3. **Key Consideration:**
   - The question focuses on **maximum speed**, which occurs during a dive for both birds. The peregrine falcon's diving speed (240+ mph) significantly exceeds the golden eagle's (150–160 mph).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The peregrine falcon is faster than the eagle in a dive, which is the context where their top speeds are measured.

**Final Answer:**  
Yes.
