Okay, so the question is whether Russia is larger in area than Australia. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to recall the approximate areas of both countries. I remember that Russia is one of the largest countries in the world. I think it's the largest, but I'm not 100% sure. Then there's Canada, which is also a big country. But the question is about Australia. Australia is a continent as well as a country, so maybe it's quite large too.

Wait, I should get the exact numbers. Let me try to remember. Russia's area is around 17 million square kilometers. Canada is next, maybe around 10 million. Then the United States, but I think the US is a bit smaller than Canada. Australia's area... Hmm, I think Australia is about 7.6 million square kilometers. Wait, is that right? Or is it more? Let me think. I've heard that Australia is the sixth largest country by area. So if Russia is first, Canada second, then the US, China, Brazil, and Australia. So if Australia is sixth, then Russia is definitely larger. But I need to confirm the exact numbers.

Wait, maybe I should check the exact figures. Russia's area is approximately 17.1 million square kilometers. Australia's area is about 7.69 million square kilometers. So 17 million vs. 7.6 million. That's almost double. So yes, Russia is larger than Australia. But wait, I should make sure that I'm not confusing the numbers. Sometimes people mention the area of Australia as 7.69 million km², and Russia as 17.09 million km². So the difference is significant. Therefore, the answer should be yes, Russia is larger in area than Australia.
