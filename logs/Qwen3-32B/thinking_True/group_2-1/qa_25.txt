Okay, so the question is whether the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is less than that on Earth. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the acceleration due to gravity on a celestial body depends on its mass and radius. The formula for gravitational acceleration at the surface is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation. The formula is g = G*M/R², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the celestial body, and R is its radius. So, if I can compare the mass and radius of the Moon and Earth, I can figure out their respective gravitational accelerations.

I need to recall the masses and radii of both the Earth and the Moon. Let me jot down the approximate values. The Earth's mass is about 5.97 × 10²⁴ kg, and its radius is roughly 6,371 kilometers. The Moon's mass is much smaller, around 7.34 × 10²² kg, and its radius is about 1,737 kilometers. 

So, plugging these into the formula. For Earth, g_earth = G*(5.97e24 kg)/(6.371e6 m)². For the Moon, g_moon = G*(7.34e22 kg)/(1.737e6 m)². Let me compute these values. 

But wait, I might not need to calculate the exact numbers. I can compare the ratios. Let's see. The Moon's mass is about 1.2% of Earth's mass (since 7.34e22 / 5.97e24 ≈ 0.0123). The radius of the Moon is about 27.3% of Earth's radius (1.737 / 6.371 ≈ 0.272). 

Since the gravitational acceleration is proportional to mass and inversely proportional to the square of the radius, the ratio of the Moon's gravity to Earth's would be (M_moon / M_earth) / (R_moon / R_earth)². Plugging in the numbers: (0.0123) / (0.272)². Let me calculate the denominator first: 0.272 squared is approximately 0.073984. Then, 0.0123 divided by 0.073984 is roughly 0.166. So, the Moon's gravity is about 1/6th of Earth's. 

Therefore, the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is indeed less than that on Earth. I think that's right. I remember from school that astronauts on the Moon experience about 1/6th the gravity of Earth, which makes them bounce around more. So this calculation aligns with that. 

Wait, let me double-check the numbers. The exact value of Earth's gravity is about 9.81 m/s². The Moon's is approximately 1.625 m/s². Dividing 1.625 by 9.81 gives roughly 0.1656, which is about 16.56%, so that's about 1/6th. Yep, that matches. So the Moon's gravity is less. 

Another way to think about it: the Moon is smaller and less massive, so its gravitational pull is weaker. Even though the radius is smaller, the inverse square law means that the radius's effect is squared, so the smaller radius doesn't compensate for the much smaller mass. 

So, putting it all together, the answer should be yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Gravitational Acceleration Formula:**  
   The acceleration due to gravity on a celestial body is given by:  
   $$
   g = \frac{G \cdot M}{R^2}
   $$  
   where $ G $ is the gravitational constant, $ M $ is the mass, and $ R $ is the radius of the body.

2. **Earth's Parameters:**  
   - Mass ($ M_{\text{Earth}} $): $ 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} $  
   - Radius ($ R_{\text{Earth}} $): $ 6,371 \, \text{km} $  
   - Gravitational acceleration ($ g_{\text{Earth}} $): $ 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 $.

3. **Moon's Parameters:**  
   - Mass ($ M_{\text{Moon}} $): $ 7.34 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg} $ (≈1.2% of Earth's mass).  
   - Radius ($ R_{\text{Moon}} $): $ 1,737 \, \text{km} $ (≈27.3% of Earth's radius).  
   - Gravitational acceleration ($ g_{\text{Moon}} $): $ 1.625 \, \text{m/s}^2 $.

4. **Ratio Comparison:**  
   The ratio of the Moon's gravity to Earth's is:  
   $$
   \frac{g_{\text{Moon}}}{g_{\text{Earth}}} = \frac{M_{\text{Moon}}/M_{\text{Earth}}}{(R_{\text{Moon}}/R_{\text{Earth}})^2} = \frac{0.0123}{(0.272)^2} \approx 0.166 \, (\text{or } 16.6\%).
   $$  
   This confirms the Moon's gravity is about **1/6th** of Earth's.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   The Moon's smaller mass and radius result in a significantly weaker gravitational acceleration compared to Earth.

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes.**
