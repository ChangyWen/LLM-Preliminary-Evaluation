Okay, so the question is whether a cheetah is faster than a lion. Let me think about this. I remember from school that cheetahs are known for their speed. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers. Let me try to recall.

First, I need to compare the top speeds of both animals. I think cheetahs are the fastest land animals. Maybe around 60-70 miles per hour? Wait, I think I've heard numbers like 60 to 75 mph for cheetahs. But lions, I'm not as sure. I think lions are faster than some other big cats, but not as fast as cheetahs. Maybe around 35-40 mph? Or is that for tigers? Hmm.

Wait, another angle: cheetahs have a slender body and long legs, which are built for speed. They also have non-retractable claws for better traction. Lions, on the other hand, are more muscular and built for strength rather than speed. Their retractable claws might not help as much in sprinting. So that makes sense why cheetahs would be faster.

But I should check if there's any overlap or if the numbers are close. Let me think. If cheetahs can hit 70 mph and lions maybe 50 mph, then yes. But I might be mixing up with other animals. Wait, I think the actual top speed of a cheetah is about 50-70 mph, but they can only maintain it for short bursts. Lions can run up to 35-40 mph. So even if the cheetah's top speed is a bit lower, it's still higher than the lion's. 

Wait, another thought: sometimes people confuse acceleration with top speed. Cheetahs can accelerate quickly, but the question is about speed. So even if a lion can start running faster initially, the cheetah's top speed is higher. So the answer would still be yes.

I should also consider sources. I remember reading that the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is the fastest land animal, with a top speed of around 60-70 mph (97-113 km/h). Lions (Panthera leo) have a top speed of about 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h). So yes, cheetahs are faster. 

But wait, maybe there's a scenario where a lion could be faster? Like in a longer chase? But the question is about speed, not endurance. So even if lions can run longer, their top speed is lower. Therefore, the answer is yes, cheetahs are faster than lions.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Animals in Question:**  
   - Cheetah (*Acinonyx jubatus*) and Lion (*Panthera leo*).

2. **Compare Top Speeds:**  
   - **Cheetah:** Known as the fastest land animal, with a top speed of **50–70 mph (80–113 km/h)**. This speed is achieved in short bursts (typically 20–30 seconds) due to their lightweight build, non-retractable claws for traction, and specialized musculature.  
   - **Lion:** A powerful predator but built for strength and endurance. Its top speed is **35–40 mph (56–64 km/h)**, significantly lower than the cheetah’s. Lions rely on ambush tactics and teamwork rather than pure speed.

3. **Anatomical and Behavioral Factors:**  
   - Cheetahs have a streamlined body, long legs, and a flexible spine, optimized for explosive acceleration and high-speed chases.  
   - Lions, with their muscular build and retractable claws, prioritize power and stamina for hunting larger prey, not speed.

4. **Clarify the Question:**  
   The query focuses on **top speed**, not acceleration, endurance, or hunting strategy. Even if lions accelerate faster initially, their maximum velocity is lower than cheetahs.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   Based on verified data and biological adaptations, cheetahs are unequivocally faster than lions in terms of top speed.

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes.**
