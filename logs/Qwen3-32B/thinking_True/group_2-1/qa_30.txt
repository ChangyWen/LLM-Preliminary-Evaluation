Okay, so the question is whether the average human lifespan is longer than that of a dog. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to recall the average lifespans for both humans and dogs. For humans, I know that the global average life expectancy is around 70 to 80 years, but it can vary by country. For example, in some developed countries, it might be higher, like 80 years or more, while in less developed regions, it might be lower. But I think the global average is probably around 73 years as of recent data.

Now for dogs, their lifespan depends on the breed and size. Smaller dogs tend to live longer than larger ones. I remember that the average lifespan for a dog is around 10 to 13 years. For example, a Chihuahua might live 15 years, while a Great Dane might only live 8 to 10 years. So taking an average across all breeds, maybe around 10 to 12 years. 

Wait, but I should check if there's a standard average. I think the commonly cited average is about 10 to 13 years. Let me confirm. The ASPCA mentions that the average lifespan of a dog is 10 to 13 years, depending on size and breed. So if the average is around 11.5 years, that's significantly less than the human average of 70+ years. 

So comparing the two, 70 years for humans versus 11.5 years for dogs. That's a big difference. Therefore, the average human lifespan is indeed longer than that of a dog. 

I don't think there's any overlap where a dog's average lifespan exceeds a human's. Even if we take the upper end of a dog's lifespan, say 15 years, it's still way below the human average. So the answer should be yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Human Lifespan:**
   - The global average human lifespan is approximately **73 years** (as of recent data from the World Health Organization).
   - In developed countries, this can be higher (e.g., 80+ years), while in less developed regions, it may be lower.

2. **Dog Lifespan:**
   - The average lifespan of a dog varies by breed and size. Smaller breeds typically live longer (e.g., 15+ years), while larger breeds have shorter lifespans (e.g., 8–10 years).
   - A commonly cited average for all dog breeds is **10–13 years** (e.g., ASPCA data).

3. **Comparison:**
   - Even the upper end of a dog's lifespan (15 years) is significantly shorter than the global human average (73 years).
   - The average dog lifespan (11.5 years) is far below the human average.

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes**, the average human lifespan is longer than that of a dog.
