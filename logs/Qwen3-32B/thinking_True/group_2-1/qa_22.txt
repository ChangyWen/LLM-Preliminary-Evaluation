Okay, so the question is whether Brazil is located south of Canada. Let me think through this step by step. First, I need to recall the general locations of both countries on the globe. Canada is in North America, right? It's a large country that borders the United States to the south. Brazil, on the other hand, is in South America. I remember that South America is mostly in the southern hemisphere, while North America is in the northern hemisphere.

Wait, but I should be careful here. Just because Brazil is in South America doesn't automatically mean it's directly south of Canada. The continents are positioned differently. Let me visualize a map. Canada is at the top of North America, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific and up to the Arctic. Brazil is in the eastern part of South America, with a large portion of the country in the tropics. 

Now, considering latitude. Canada's southernmost point is around the 42nd parallel, which is similar to the northern part of the United States. Brazil's northernmost point is around the 5th parallel north, and its southernmost is around the 34th parallel south. So, if I compare the latitudes, Canada is mostly between 42°N to 83°N, while Brazil is between 5°N to 34°S. That means Brazil's southernmost parts are in the southern hemisphere, while Canada is entirely in the northern hemisphere. 

Therefore, since Brazil extends into the southern hemisphere and Canada is entirely in the northern hemisphere, Brazil is indeed located south of Canada. Even though they are on different continents, the latitudinal positions confirm that Brazil is further south. I should also consider if there's any overlap or if part of Brazil is north of Canada, but given the latitudes, Brazil's northernmost point is still south of Canada's southernmost point. So the answer should be yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Geographical Continents:**  
   - Canada is located in **North America**.  
   - Brazil is located in **South America**.  

2. **Hemispheric Position:**  
   - Canada lies entirely in the **Northern Hemisphere** (latitudes ~42°N to 83°N).  
   - Brazil spans both the **Northern and Southern Hemispheres** (latitudes ~5°N to 34°S).  

3. **Latitudinal Comparison:**  
   - Canada’s southernmost point (~42°N) is still **north of Brazil’s northernmost point** (~5°N).  
   - Brazil’s southernmost point (~34°S) is significantly **south of Canada’s northernmost point** (~83°N).  

4. **Conclusion:**  
   Since Brazil’s southernmost regions extend into the Southern Hemisphere and its northernmost regions are still south of Canada’s southernmost regions, **Brazil is entirely located south of Canada**.  

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes.**
