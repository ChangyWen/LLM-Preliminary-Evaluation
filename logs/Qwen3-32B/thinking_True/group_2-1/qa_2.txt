Okay, so the question is whether Mount Everest is taller than K2. Let me think about this. I know both are major mountains, but I need to recall their exact heights. First, I remember that Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world. But wait, is that still the case? I think K2 is the second highest. Let me verify.

Mount Everest's height is commonly cited as 8,848 meters above sea level. I've heard that there was a recent measurement from China and Nepal that adjusted the height slightly, maybe to 8,848.86 meters. But I'm not sure if that's the official figure now. K2, on the other hand, is known as the second-highest mountain. I think its height is around 8,611 meters. Wait, is that correct? Let me check my memory. Some sources might round the numbers, so I need to be precise.

Another way to approach this is to compare the two. If Everest is the highest, then by definition it should be taller than K2. But I want to make sure there's no confusion with other mountains. For example, some people might confuse K2 with other peaks like Kangchenjunga or Lhotse, but those are lower than Everest. K2 is definitely the second. 

Wait, could there be any discrepancies in the measurements? I remember that there was some debate about the exact height of K2. Some sources might have slightly different numbers. For example, the US Geological Survey lists K2 at 8,611 meters, while other sources might have it as 8,609 or 8,610. But regardless of the slight variations, Everest is still significantly higher. 

Let me do a quick calculation. If Everest is 8,848 meters and K2 is 8,611, the difference is about 237 meters. That's a substantial gap. Even if K2's height was measured a bit higher, say 8,615, the difference would still be over 200 meters. So, yes, Everest is taller. 

I should also consider if there's any other factor. For example, sometimes people talk about the height from base to summit, but I think the standard measurement is from sea level. Both Everest and K2 are measured this way. So, the answer should be yes, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Subject:** The question asks whether Mount Everest is taller than K2, two of the world's highest mountains.

2. **Recall General Knowledge:**  
   - Mount Everest is widely recognized as the **tallest mountain in the world**.  
   - K2 is known as the **second-highest mountain**.  

3. **Verify Specific Measurements:**  
   - **Mount Everest:**  
     - Official height (as of 2020, after a joint Nepal-China survey): **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)** above sea level.  
   - **K2:**  
     - Official height: **8,611 meters (28,251 feet)** above sea level (per the USGS and most authoritative sources).  

4. **Compare the Heights:**  
   - **Difference:** 8,848.86 m (Everest) - 8,611 m (K2) = **237.86 meters**.  
   - Even accounting for minor variations in historical measurements (e.g., K2 at 8,609 m or 8,610 m), Everest remains significantly taller.  

5. **Address Potential Confusions:**  
   - The question is about **elevation above sea level**, not base-to-summit height or other metrics.  
   - No credible data disputes Everestâ€™s status as the tallest.  

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes**, Mount Everest is taller than K2.
