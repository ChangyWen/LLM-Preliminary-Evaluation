Okay, so the question is whether gold is more expensive than silver. Let me think through this step by step. First, I need to understand what "more expensive" means in this context. Typically, when comparing the price of two metals, we look at their market prices per unit weight, usually per troy ounce. 

I remember that both gold and silver are precious metals, but they have different uses and market dynamics. Gold is often seen as a store of value and is used in jewelry, electronics, and as an investment. Silver is also used in jewelry, but it's more industrial, used in things like solar panels, electronics, and even some medical applications. 

Now, I need to recall the current market prices. From what I know, gold has a much higher price per troy ounce compared to silver. For example, as of recent data, gold might be around $2,000 per troy ounce, while silver is around $25 per troy ounce. That's a significant difference. But wait, maybe I should check if there's a time when silver was more expensive. I don't think so. Historically, gold has always been more valuable than silver. 

But wait, could there be a scenario where silver is more expensive? Maybe if there's a sudden surge in demand for silver due to industrial needs, but even then, the price per ounce of gold is usually much higher. Let me think about the supply and demand factors. Gold is rarer than silver, which contributes to its higher price. Silver is more abundant, so even with industrial demand, its price per ounce doesn't reach the levels of gold. 

Another angle: sometimes people compare by volume or by other measures, but the standard is per troy ounce. So, if we convert both to the same unit, gold is definitely more expensive. For example, 1 troy ounce of gold vs. 1 troy ounce of silver. The gold would cost way more. 

I should also consider if there's any confusion between troy ounces and regular ounces. A troy ounce is heavier than a regular ounce (about 31.1 grams vs. 28.35 grams), but both metals are priced per troy ounce, so that's consistent. 

So, putting it all together: Gold's higher rarity, historical value, and current market prices all point to it being more expensive than silver per troy ounce. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Unit of Comparison:**  
   - Both gold and silver are priced per **troy ounce** (31.1 grams), the standard unit for precious metals. This ensures a fair comparison.

2. **Market Prices (as of recent data):**  
   - **Gold:** ~$2,000 per troy ounce.  
   - **Silver:** ~$25 per troy ounce.  
   - Gold is approximately **80 times more expensive** than silver per troy ounce.

3. **Historical Context:**  
   - Gold has consistently been more valuable than silver due to its rarity, historical role as a store of value, and limited industrial use compared to silver.

4. **Supply and Demand Factors:**  
   - Gold is rarer and has a smaller global supply than silver.  
   - While silver has industrial demand (e.g., electronics, solar panels), its abundance keeps its price lower than gold.

5. **No Exceptions in Standard Pricing:**  
   - Even during periods of high industrial demand for silver, its price per troy ounce does not approach that of gold.  

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes**, gold is more expensive than silver.
