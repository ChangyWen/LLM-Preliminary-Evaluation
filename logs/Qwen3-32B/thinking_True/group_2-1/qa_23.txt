Okay, so I need to figure out if the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water. Let me start by recalling what pH means. pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. The scale goes from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral, which is pure water. Anything below 7 is acidic, and above 7 is basic.

Now, lemon juice is something I know is acidic. I've heard that it's sour, which is a common characteristic of acids. But I should verify the actual pH values. Let me think. Pure water has a pH of 7. Lemon juice, on the other hand, is a citrus fruit juice. Citrus fruits are known for their acidity. I remember that the pH of lemon juice is around 2 to 3. Wait, is that right? Let me check my memory. Yes, I think that's correct. For example, orange juice is around 3.5 to 4, and lemon juice is more acidic than that. So maybe around 2 to 2.5? 

But wait, I should be careful here. Sometimes people confuse the pH of different substances. For example, vinegar is around 2.4 to 3.4, and lemon juice is similar. So if lemon juice is around 2, then water is 7. So 2 is definitely lower than 7. Therefore, the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water. 

But let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. Let me think of another example. Battery acid is super acidic, like pH 0 or 1. Lemon juice is not that strong, but still, 2 to 3 is definitely in the acidic range. So yes, since water is neutral at 7, and lemon juice is acidic, its pH is lower. 

Wait, could there be any exceptions? Like, is there a case where lemon juice might have a pH higher than 7? No, because it's a citrus juice, and the citric acid in it makes it acidic. Unless the lemon juice is somehow contaminated or diluted, but the question is about lemon juice in general. So under normal circumstances, lemon juice is acidic. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes. The pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding pH Scale:**
   - The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14.
   - A pH of **7** is neutral (e.g., pure water).
   - Values **below 7** indicate acidity.
   - Values **above 7** indicate basicity.

2. **pH of Water:**
   - Pure water has a pH of **7**, as it is neutral.

3. **pH of Lemon Juice:**
   - Lemon juice contains **citric acid**, a weak organic acid.
   - The pH of lemon juice typically ranges from **2 to 3**, depending on concentration and ripeness.

4. **Comparison:**
   - Since **2â€“3 (lemon juice)** is **less than 7 (water)**, lemon juice is more acidic than water.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The pH of lemon juice is **lower** than that of water.

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes**.
