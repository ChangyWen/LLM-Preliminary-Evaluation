Okay, so I need to figure out if the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two deserts. The Sahara is in Africa, right? It's the largest hot desert in the world. I remember hearing that it's extremely hot, with temperatures that can be really high during the day. The Gobi Desert, on the other hand, is in Asia, spanning parts of China and Mongolia. I think the Gobi is a cold desert, maybe because it's in a higher latitude or at a higher elevation?

Wait, so the key here is understanding the difference between hot and cold deserts. Hot deserts like the Sahara have high temperatures year-round, while cold deserts like the Gobi have colder winters and maybe not as high summer temperatures. But I need to confirm the actual temperature ranges for both.

Let me think about the Sahara first. I've heard that the average high temperature in the Sahara can be around 38°C (100°F) during the day, but in some areas, it can get up to 50°C (122°F) or even higher. The record high temperature for the Sahara might be something like 58°C (136°F), but I'm not sure if that's accurate. I should check if that's a real record or just a common misconception.

Now the Gobi Desert. Since it's a cold desert, I think its temperatures vary more. In the summer, maybe the Gobi gets up to around 40°C (104°F), but in the winter, it can get really cold, maybe down to -40°C (-40°F). So the Gobi has a much wider temperature range compared to the Sahara. But during the summer months, when both deserts are experiencing their warmest periods, which one is hotter?

I should also consider the climate classifications. The Sahara is a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), which means it's hot and dry all year. The Gobi is a cold desert (BWk), so it has cold winters and warm, but not extremely hot, summers. So the Gobi's summer temperatures might not reach the same extremes as the Sahara's.

Another point is elevation. The Gobi is at a higher elevation compared to the Sahara. Higher elevations generally have cooler temperatures, so that might contribute to the Gobi not being as hot as the Sahara. The Sahara is mostly at lower elevations, which can trap heat more effectively.

But wait, I should verify the actual temperature records. The highest temperature ever recorded in the Sahara was 58°C (136°F) in Azizia, Libya, in 1922. However, there's some debate about the accuracy of that reading. The current official record for the highest temperature in the Sahara might be lower. For the Gobi, the highest temperature recorded is around 49°C (120°F) in Xinjiang, China, in 2017. So if the Sahara's record is 58°C and the Gobi's is 49°C, then the Sahara is hotter.

But I need to be careful here. The question is about the deserts in general, not just their record highs. The average summer temperatures in the Sahara are higher than in the Gobi. For example, in the Sahara, summer highs can be around 40-50°C, while in the Gobi, summer highs might be 30-40°C. So on average, the Sahara is hotter.

However, I should also consider that the Gobi's cold winters might make its overall average temperature lower, but the question is specifically about being hotter, which I think refers to the maximum temperatures rather than the annual average. So if the Sahara can reach higher temperatures than the Gobi, then the answer would be yes.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the Gobi doesn't have any areas that are as hot as the Sahara. The Gobi is a cold desert, so even in summer, it's not as hot as the Sahara. The Sahara is a hot desert, so it's consistently hotter. Therefore, the answer should be yes, the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Climate Classification:**
   - The **Sahara Desert** is a **hot desert** (Köppen BWh), characterized by consistently high temperatures year-round.
   - The **Gobi Desert** is a **cold desert** (Köppen BWk), with cold winters and relatively milder summers.

2. **Temperature Ranges:**
   - **Sahara Desert:**
     - Average summer highs: 38–50°C (100–122°F).
     - Record high: 58°C (136°F) in 1922 (though debated, it remains the highest recorded in the Sahara).
   - **Gobi Desert:**
     - Average summer highs: 30–40°C (86–104°F).
     - Record high: 49°C (120°F) in 2017.
     - Winters can drop to -40°C (-40°F), creating a much wider temperature range.

3. **Elevation and Geography:**
   - The Sahara is at lower elevations, which contributes to higher heat retention.
   - The Gobi is at a higher elevation (average ~1,000–1,500 meters), leading to cooler temperatures overall.

4. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - The Sahara’s summer temperatures consistently exceed those of the Gobi.
   - Even the Gobi’s record high (49°C) is lower than the Sahara’s record (58°C).
   - The Sahara’s hot desert climate ensures higher average and peak temperatures compared to the Gobi’s cold desert climate.

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes**, the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert.
