Okay, so the question is whether a blue whale is heavier than an elephant. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to recall the average weights of both animals. I know that blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, but I'm not exactly sure of their exact weight. Maybe around 100 tons? Wait, I think I've heard that they can be up to 200 tons. But I should double-check that. 

On the other hand, elephants are also very large. African elephants are bigger than Asian elephants. I remember that African elephants can weigh around 6 to 7 tons. But wait, that seems a bit low compared to blue whales. Maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think again. Oh, right, the African bush elephant is the largest land animal. Their weight is usually cited as up to 6,000 to 7,000 kilograms, which is about 6 to 7 metric tons. But blue whales are in the ocean, so their weight must be much higher. 

Wait, 1 metric ton is 1,000 kilograms. So if a blue whale is 150 tons, that's 150,000 kilograms. An elephant at 6 tons is 6,000 kg. So the blue whale is way heavier. But I need to confirm the exact numbers. 

Let me try to remember. I think the average blue whale weighs between 150 to 180 metric tons. The maximum can be even higher, like 190 tons. For elephants, the African bush elephant is the heaviest, with males reaching up to 6 to 7 tons. So even the heaviest elephant is nowhere near the weight of a blue whale. 

But wait, maybe I'm confusing with other large animals. For example, the Argentinosaurus, a dinosaur, was said to be around 70-80 tons, but that's not relevant here. The current question is about living animals. 

So, blue whale: 150-180 tons. Elephant: 6-7 tons. Therefore, yes, a blue whale is significantly heavier than an elephant. 

I should also consider if there's any exception. For example, are there any elephant species that are heavier? I don't think so. The African bush elephant is the largest land animal, but even the largest individuals are around 7 tons. The blue whale, being the largest animal ever, would definitely surpass that. 

Another point: sometimes people might confuse weight with length. Blue whales are also the longest animals, reaching up to 30 meters. But the question is about weight. So even if the length is longer, the weight is also much higher. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But to be thorough, I can check some sources. For example, according to National Geographic, blue whales can weigh up to 173 metric tons (190 short tons). African elephants can weigh up to 6,000 kg (6 metric tons). So the blue whale is way heavier. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the conclusion is that a blue whale is heavier than an elephant.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Animals in Question:**
   - **Blue Whale:** The largest animal on Earth, living in oceans.
   - **Elephant:** The largest land animal, with African bush elephants being the heaviest.

2. **Average Weight of a Blue Whale:**
   - Blue whales typically weigh between **150 to 180 metric tons** (165 to 198 short tons).
   - The heaviest recorded blue whale weighed approximately **173 metric tons** (190 short tons).

3. **Average Weight of an Elephant:**
   - **African bush elephants** (the largest land animals) weigh up to **6 to 7 metric tons** (6.6 to 7.7 short tons).
   - **Asian elephants** are smaller, weighing up to **5 metric tons** (5.5 short tons).

4. **Comparison:**
   - A blue whale (150–180 metric tons) is **20–30 times heavier** than the heaviest elephant (6–7 metric tons).
   - Even the smallest adult blue whale exceeds the weight of the largest elephant.

5. **Verification with Reliable Sources:**
   - National Geographic and scientific studies confirm blue whales are the heaviest animals, with weights far surpassing those of elephants.

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes**, a blue whale is significantly heavier than an elephant.
