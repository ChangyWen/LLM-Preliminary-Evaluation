Okay, so I need to figure out if a blue whale has a larger heart than an elephant. Let me start by recalling what I know about blue whales and elephants. 

First, blue whales are the largest animals on Earth. I remember that they can grow up to around 100 feet long and weigh as much as 200 tons. Elephants, on the other hand, are the largest land animals. African elephants can be up to 24 feet long and weigh around 6 tons. So, blue whales are way bigger in size and weight.

Now, the question is about their hearts. I think the size of an animal's heart is related to its overall body size. Bigger animals generally have bigger hearts because the heart has to pump blood throughout the entire body. So, if a blue whale is much larger than an elephant, it's logical to assume that its heart would be larger too. 

But wait, I should check if there are any exceptions or specific data points. I remember reading somewhere that the blue whale's heart is about the size of a small car. That seems really big. Let me try to recall the exact numbers. I think the blue whale's heart can weigh around 400 pounds. 

What about elephants? I think an elephant's heart is also quite large. Maybe around 200 pounds? I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. I've heard that an elephant's heart can weigh up to 25-30 pounds, but that seems too small compared to the blue whale. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the weight with something else. No, that can't be right. If the blue whale's heart is 400 pounds, and the elephant's is 25 pounds, then the answer is definitely yes. But I need to verify these numbers.

Let me try to recall some sources. From what I remember, the blue whale's heart is indeed massive. The left ventricle alone can be as big as a car tire. The aorta, the main artery, is about the thickness of a garden hose. The heart's weight is often cited as around 400 pounds. 

For the elephant, I think the heart is smaller. I found in some previous knowledge that an elephant's heart can weigh around 25-30 pounds. Wait, that's a big difference. If the blue whale's heart is 400 pounds and the elephant's is 25, then yes, the blue whale's heart is much larger. 

But I should make sure I'm not mixing up facts. Maybe the elephant's heart is larger in some way? Let me think. Another angle: the blue whale is a marine mammal, so its heart has to pump blood through a body that's adapted to water. The elephant is a land animal. The circulatory system in a blue whale has to handle the pressure of moving blood through a much larger body, which would require a more powerful and larger heart. 

Also, considering the size of the heart in relation to body weight. The blue whale's heart is about 1% of its body weight. If the blue whale weighs 200 tons (which is 400,000 pounds), 1% would be 4,000 pounds. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, maybe the percentage is different. Let me recalculate. If the heart is 400 pounds and the body is 200 tons (400,000 pounds), then 400/400,000 is 0.1%. That seems low. Maybe the percentage is higher. 

Alternatively, maybe the heart is about 0.5% of body weight. For a 200-ton whale, that would be 1,000 pounds. But I've heard the number 400 pounds before. Maybe the exact percentage varies. 

For the elephant, if it's 6 tons (12,000 pounds), and the heart is 25 pounds, that's about 0.2%. So, the blue whale's heart is larger in absolute terms. 

Another way to check is to compare the size of the heart in terms of volume. The blue whale's heart is so large that a human could swim through it. That's a common analogy. The elephant's heart, while large, is not that big. 

So putting it all together: blue whale's heart is significantly larger than an elephant's. The numbers I remember are 400 pounds for the blue whale and 25-30 pounds for the elephant. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding the Animals' Sizes:**
   - **Blue Whale:** The largest animal on Earth, reaching lengths of up to 100 feet (30 meters) and weights of 200 tons (400,000 pounds).
   - **Elephant:** The largest land animal, with African elephants reaching lengths of 24 feet (7.3 meters) and weights of 6 tons (12,000 pounds).

2. **Heart Size Correlation to Body Size:**
   - Larger animals require larger hearts to pump blood efficiently throughout their bodies. This is due to the increased volume of blood and the need to maintain circulation over greater distances.

3. **Specific Data on Heart Sizes:**
   - **Blue Whale:** The heart is estimated to weigh **400 pounds (180 kg)**. The left ventricle alone can be as large as a car tire, and the aorta (main artery) is about the thickness of a garden hose. The heart is so massive that a human could theoretically swim through it.
   - **Elephant:** The heart is significantly smaller, weighing approximately **25–30 pounds (11–14 kg)**. This is about 0.2% of the elephant's body weight, compared to the blue whale's heart, which is roughly 0.1% of its body weight.

4. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - The blue whale's heart is **13–16 times heavier** than an elephant's heart. Even when considering the percentage of body weight, the blue whale's heart is proportionally smaller (0.1%) but still larger in absolute terms due to the whale's immense size.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The blue whale's heart is **much larger** than an elephant's heart in both absolute weight and physical dimensions.

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes.**
