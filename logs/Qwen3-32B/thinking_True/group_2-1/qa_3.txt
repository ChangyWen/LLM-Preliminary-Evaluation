Okay, so the question is whether Albert Einstein died later than Isaac Newton. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to recall the dates of death for both scientists. I know that Isaac Newton was a famous physicist and mathematician from the 17th and 18th centuries. He made significant contributions to classical mechanics and calculus. I think he died in the early 1700s. Let me try to remember the exact year. I believe Newton was born in 1643 and died in 1727. Wait, yes, I think that's right. So his death date would be March 31, 1727, in the Gregorian calendar, which is the calendar we use today. But I should double-check that to be sure. Maybe he died in 1727, and since the Gregorian calendar was adopted later in some countries, but I think the key point is the year.

Now, Albert Einstein was a 20th-century physicist, known for the theory of relativity. He was born in 1879 and died in 1955. I remember that he died in April 1955, specifically April 18, 1955. So his death date is definitely in the 20th century.

Comparing the two dates: Newton died in 1727, Einstein in 1955. Since 1955 is much later than 1727, Einstein died after Newton. Therefore, the answer should be yes. But wait, let me confirm the exact dates again to make sure I didn't mix up the years. Newton's death year is definitely 1727. Einstein's death year is 1955. So yes, Einstein died later than Newton. There's a gap of over two centuries between their deaths. So the answer is yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Isaac Newton's death date:**  
   - Isaac Newton died on **March 31, 1727** (Gregorian calendar).  
   - This is widely documented in historical records.

2. **Identify Albert Einstein's death date:**  
   - Albert Einstein died on **April 18, 1955**.  
   - This is also well-established in historical and biographical sources.

3. **Compare the dates:**  
   - **1727 (Newton's death year)** is significantly earlier than **1955 (Einstein's death year)**.  
   - The gap between their deaths is **228 years**.

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes**, Albert Einstein died later than Isaac Newton.
