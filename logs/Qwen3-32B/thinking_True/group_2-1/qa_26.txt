Okay, so I need to figure out whether the discovery of penicillin happened before the discovery of the DNA structure. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two events.

First, penicillin. I remember that penicillin is an antibiotic, right? I think it was discovered by Alexander Fleming. I'm pretty sure that was in the early 20th century. Maybe the 1920s or 1930s? I'm not exactly sure of the year, but I know it was a significant discovery because it was one of the first antibiotics and revolutionized medicine by treating bacterial infections.

Now, the structure of DNA. That's the double helix, right? I think that was discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick. I remember something about them using X-ray diffraction images from Rosalind Franklin. I think that was in the 1950s. Maybe 1953? That rings a bell. So Watson and Crick published their model of DNA in 1953.

So if penicillin was discovered in the 1920s or 1930s and DNA structure in 1953, then penicillin would have been discovered first. But wait, let me check the exact years to be sure. I might be mixing up the dates. Let me think. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928. That's a specific date I remember now. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum killed bacteria in a petri dish. Then, later, in the 1940s, other scientists like Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain developed it into a usable drug, but the initial discovery was in 1928.

On the DNA side, the structure was determined in 1953 by Watson and Crick. So 1928 is way before 1953. Therefore, the discovery of penicillin definitely came before the discovery of the DNA structure. I don't think there's any overlap or confusion here. The key is confirming the exact years. Penicillin's discovery was in the late 1920s, and DNA's structure was in the early 1950s. So the answer should be yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Discovery of Penicillin:**
   - Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in **1928**. He observed that the mold *Penicillium notatum* inhibited bacterial growth in a petri dish. This marked the first discovery of a true antibiotic.

2. **Discovery of DNA Structure:**
   - The double-helix structure of DNA was elucidated by James Watson and Francis Crick in **1953**. Their work was based on X-ray diffraction data, notably from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins.

3. **Chronological Comparison:**
   - Penicillin's discovery (1928) predates the DNA structure discovery (1953) by over two decades.

**Final Answer:**  
Yes.
