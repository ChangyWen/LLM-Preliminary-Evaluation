Okay, so the question is whether the boiling point of water is higher than its freezing point. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, I need to recall the standard boiling and freezing points of water. I remember that at standard atmospheric pressure, which is 1 atmosphere or about 101.3 kPa, water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. And the freezing point, which is when water turns into ice, is 0 degrees Celsius under the same pressure. So, if I compare those two numbers, 100°C versus 0°C, clearly 100 is a higher number. So that would mean the boiling point is higher than the freezing point. 

Wait, but maybe I should double-check if there are any other factors. For example, does pressure affect these points? Yes, pressure does affect both. If the pressure is higher, the boiling point increases, and if the pressure is lower, the boiling point decreases. Similarly, the freezing point can also be affected by pressure, though I think the effect is much smaller. But the question doesn't specify any particular pressure, so I assume it's referring to standard atmospheric pressure. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes people might confuse the melting point and freezing point. But in most cases, the melting point and freezing point are the same temperature for a substance. For water, the melting point (when ice turns to water) and freezing point (when water turns to ice) are both 0°C at standard pressure. So that's consistent. 

So, under standard conditions, boiling is at 100°C, freezing at 0°C. Therefore, the boiling point is indeed higher. 

I don't think there's any exception here unless we're talking about different phases or non-standard conditions. For example, if you're at a high altitude where the atmospheric pressure is lower, the boiling point of water would be lower than 100°C. But the freezing point would still be around 0°C, maybe slightly different, but not enough to make it higher than the boiling point. Even in such cases, the boiling point would still be higher than the freezing point. 

Wait, let me think again. Suppose you have a situation where the pressure is so low that the boiling point drops below 0°C. But in reality, water can't exist as a liquid below 0°C at standard pressure. If you lower the pressure enough, water can sublimate directly from solid to gas. But in that case, the freezing point might not be defined in the same way. However, the question is about the boiling point versus the freezing point. If the boiling point is below 0°C, then technically, the freezing point (which is still around 0°C) would be higher. But that's under non-standard pressure. 

But the question doesn't specify any pressure, so I think the default is standard atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the answer is yes. 

Another angle: maybe the user is thinking of Fahrenheit? Let me check. In Fahrenheit, the freezing point is 32°F and the boiling point is 212°F. So again, 212 is higher than 32. So regardless of the temperature scale, the boiling point is higher. 

So, putting it all together, under standard conditions, the boiling point of water is higher than its freezing point. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Standard Conditions:** The question refers to the boiling and freezing points of water under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm or ~101.3 kPa), which is the default assumption unless otherwise specified.

2. **Boiling Point of Water:** At standard pressure, water boils at **100°C** (212°F). This is the temperature at which liquid water transitions to gas.

3. **Freezing Point of Water:** At standard pressure, water freezes at **0°C** (32°F). This is the temperature at which liquid water transitions to solid (ice).

4. **Comparison:** Numerically, **100°C (boiling point)** is greater than **0°C (freezing point)**. This holds true regardless of the temperature scale used (Celsius or Fahrenheit).

5. **Pressure Considerations:** While pressure can alter these points (e.g., at high altitudes, boiling point decreases), the question does not specify non-standard pressure. Under standard conditions, the boiling point remains higher.

6. **Phase Transitions:** The freezing/melting point and boiling point are distinct phase transitions. Even in extreme pressure scenarios (e.g., vacuum), the freezing point does not surpass the boiling point under standard conditions.

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes**, the boiling point of water is higher than its freezing point under standard atmospheric pressure.
