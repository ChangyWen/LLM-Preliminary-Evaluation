Okay, so the question is whether the melting point of ice is lower than the boiling point of water. Let me think through this step by step. First, I need to recall what the melting point of ice is. From what I remember, ice melts at 0 degrees Celsius. That's the temperature at which solid water turns into liquid water. Now, the boiling point of water is when liquid water turns into gas, right? I think that's at 100 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. 

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not confusing the two. Let me double-check. The melting point is the temperature at which a solid becomes a liquid. For water, that's definitely 0°C. The boiling point is when a liquid becomes a gas, which is 100°C. So comparing those two numbers: 0°C versus 100°C. So 0 is lower than 100. Therefore, the melting point of ice is lower than the boiling point of water. 

But hold on, maybe there's a trick here. Are there any conditions where this might not be true? Like, if the pressure is different? For example, at higher pressures, the boiling point of water increases, and the melting point might also change slightly. But under standard atmospheric pressure, which is 1 atmosphere, the values are 0°C and 100°C. The question doesn't specify different pressures, so I think we can assume standard conditions. 

Another thing to consider: sometimes people might confuse the melting point with the freezing point. But the freezing point of water is the same as the melting point of ice, right? So if you're freezing water, it's 0°C, and if you're melting ice, it's also 0°C. So that part checks out. 

So putting it all together: melting point of ice is 0°C, boiling point of water is 100°C. 0 is less than 100. Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me just verify with a quick check. If I look up the standard melting and boiling points, does that confirm it? Yes, standard references state that ice melts at 0°C and water boils at 100°C at sea level. So the answer is yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Define Key Terms:**
   - **Melting Point of Ice:** The temperature at which solid ice transitions to liquid water. Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), this is **0°C**.
   - **Boiling Point of Water:** The temperature at which liquid water transitions to gaseous water vapor. Under standard atmospheric pressure, this is **100°C**.

2. **Compare the Two Temperatures:**
   - **0°C (melting point of ice)** is numerically **lower** than **100°C (boiling point of water)**.

3. **Consider External Factors:**
   - The question does not specify non-standard pressure conditions. Under standard pressure (1 atm), the values are unambiguous.
   - At higher pressures, the boiling point of water increases slightly, and the melting point of ice decreases slightly. However, even under these conditions, the melting point remains lower than the boiling point.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since **0°C < 100°C**, the melting point of ice is indeed lower than the boiling point of water under standard conditions.

**Final Answer:**  
Yes.
