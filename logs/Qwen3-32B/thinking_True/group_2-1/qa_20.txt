Okay, so the question is whether the atomic number of oxygen is higher than that of carbon. Let me think through this step by step. First, I need to recall what atomic number means. The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element. So, each element has a unique atomic number.

Now, I need to remember the positions of carbon and oxygen in the periodic table. Carbon is one of the lighter elements. I think it's in group 14, period 2. Its symbol is C. Oxygen is also in period 2, but I believe it's in group 16. The symbol for oxygen is O. 

Wait, the periodic table is arranged in order of increasing atomic number. So elements are listed from left to right, top to bottom, with each subsequent element having one more proton than the previous. Carbon comes before oxygen in the periodic table. Let me try to visualize the second period. The elements in period 2 start with lithium (Li), then beryllium (Be), boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and neon (Ne). So carbon is the 4th element in period 2, and oxygen is the 6th. 

If I count the atomic numbers, lithium is 3, beryllium 4, boron 5, carbon 6, nitrogen 7, oxygen 8. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, the atomic numbers start from hydrogen (1), helium (2), then lithium (3), beryllium (4), boron (5), carbon (6), nitrogen (7), oxygen (8), fluorine (9), neon (10). So carbon has an atomic number of 6, and oxygen has 8. Therefore, oxygen's atomic number is higher than carbon's. 

But let me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up the periods. Carbon is in the second period, group 14. Oxygen is in the same period, group 16. Since they're in the same period, moving from left to right increases the atomic number. Carbon is to the left of oxygen, so oxygen should have a higher atomic number. 

Alternatively, I can think of the order of elements in the periodic table. Carbon is element number 6, and oxygen is element number 8. So yes, oxygen's atomic number (8) is higher than carbon's (6). 

I think that's correct. Let me confirm with another approach. The atomic number is also the number of protons. Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen has 8. So yes, oxygen's atomic number is higher. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Definition of Atomic Number:**  
   The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in its nucleus. Elements are ordered in the periodic table by increasing atomic number.

2. **Position in the Periodic Table:**  
   - **Carbon (C)** is in **Group 14**, **Period 2**.  
   - **Oxygen (O)** is in **Group 16**, **Period 2**.  

3. **Atomic Numbers:**  
   - Carbon is the **6th element** in the periodic table (atomic number = 6).  
   - Oxygen is the **8th element** in the periodic table (atomic number = 8).  

4. **Comparison:**  
   Since 8 (oxygen) > 6 (carbon), oxygen has a higher atomic number than carbon.

**Final Answer:**  
Yes.
