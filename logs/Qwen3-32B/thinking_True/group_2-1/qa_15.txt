Okay, so the question is whether the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to recall the approximate speeds of both light and sound. From what I remember, the speed of light is extremely fast. I think it's around 300,000 kilometers per second. That's in a vacuum, right? But even in air, it's still super fast. On the other hand, the speed of sound is much slower. I believe it's about 343 meters per second in air at room temperature. Wait, that's way less than the speed of light. Let me double-check those numbers to make sure I'm not mixing them up.

Speed of light in a vacuum is exactly 299,792,458 meters per second, which is approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. In air, it's slightly less, but still around 3 x 10^8 m/s. For sound, the speed varies depending on the medium. In air at 20°C, it's about 343 m/s. In water, it's faster, maybe around 1,500 m/s, and in solids even more. But the question doesn't specify the medium, so I should assume they're both in the same medium, probably air, unless stated otherwise.

So comparing 3 x 10^8 m/s (light) to 343 m/s (sound in air), the difference is massive. Light is about 874,000 times faster than sound in air. That's a huge gap. Even in other mediums, like water or solids, the speed of sound increases, but the speed of light in those mediums is still significantly higher. For example, in water, light travels at about 2.25 x 10^8 m/s, and sound is around 1,500 m/s. Still, light is way faster.

Another way to think about it is real-life examples. When you see a lightning strike and then hear the thunder, you notice the delay. The light from the lightning reaches you almost instantly, but the sound takes several seconds to arrive. If you're 1 kilometer away, the light would take about 3.3 microseconds to reach you, while the sound would take about 3 seconds. That's a clear demonstration that light is much faster than sound.

I don't think there's any scenario where the speed of sound exceeds the speed of light. Even in the most extreme conditions, like in a solid, the speed of sound might be higher than in air, but still nowhere near the speed of light. For instance, in steel, sound travels at about 5,960 m/s, which is still 50,000 times slower than light in a vacuum.

So putting it all together, the speed of light is indeed faster than the speed of sound in any medium. The numbers back it up, and real-world observations confirm it. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Speed of Light:**  
   - In a vacuum, the speed of light is exactly **299,792,458 meters per second (m/s)** (~3.00 × 10⁸ m/s).  
   - In air, it is slightly slower (~3.00 × 10⁸ m/s).  

2. **Speed of Sound:**  
   - In air at 20°C, the speed of sound is **343 m/s**.  
   - In water, it increases to ~1,500 m/s, and in solids (e.g., steel) to ~5,960 m/s.  

3. **Comparison:**  
   - Light in air is **~874,000 times faster** than sound in air.  
   - Even in solids (where sound is fastest), light is still **~50,000 times faster**.  

4. **Real-World Evidence:**  
   - During a thunderstorm, light (lightning) is seen instantly, while sound (thunder) arrives seconds later, confirming the vast difference in speed.  

**Conclusion:**  
The speed of light is significantly faster than the speed of sound in all known mediums.  

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes.**
