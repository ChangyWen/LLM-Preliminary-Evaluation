Okay, so the question is whether the wavelength of red light is longer than that of blue light. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. But I need to recall the order of colors in terms of wavelength. I think the visible spectrum goes from red to violet, with red being on the longer wavelength end and violet on the shorter end. So red has a longer wavelength than blue. Wait, but blue is between green and violet. Let me make sure I'm not mixing this up.

I recall that in the ROYGBIV acronym for the colors of the rainbow—Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. The order here is from longest to shortest wavelength. So red is first, meaning it has the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum, and violet is last with the shortest. So blue comes after green, before indigo and violet. Therefore, blue has a shorter wavelength than green, but longer than indigo and violet. But compared to red, blue is definitely shorter. 

To confirm, I can think of specific numbers. The approximate wavelength range for red light is around 620 to 750 nanometers, while blue light is around 450 to 495 nanometers. So yes, red's wavelength is longer than blue's. 

Another way to remember is that higher frequency corresponds to shorter wavelength. Since red has a lower frequency than blue, its wavelength must be longer. Because frequency and wavelength are inversely related (c = λν, where c is the speed of light, λ is wavelength, and ν is frequency). So if red has a lower frequency, its wavelength is longer. 

Wait, let me check the frequency. Red light has a frequency of about 400 to 484 terahertz, while blue is around 606 to 668 terahertz. Since blue has a higher frequency, its wavelength must be shorter. Therefore, red's wavelength is longer. 

So putting it all together: red light has a longer wavelength than blue light. The reasoning is based on the order of the visible spectrum, specific wavelength ranges, and the inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength. All these points lead to the conclusion that red's wavelength is indeed longer than blue's.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Visible Spectrum Order:** The visible light spectrum ranges from red (longest wavelength) to violet (shortest wavelength). The acronym ROYGBIV (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet) reflects this order, with red first and violet last.

2. **Wavelength Ranges:**
   - **Red light:** Approximately **620–750 nm**.
   - **Blue light:** Approximately **450–495 nm**.
   - This numerical comparison directly shows red has a longer wavelength than blue.

3. **Frequency-Wavelength Relationship:**  
   The equation $ c = \lambda \nu $ (where $ c $ is the speed of light, $ \lambda $ is wavelength, and $ \nu $ is frequency) shows that wavelength and frequency are inversely related.  
   - **Red light** has a **lower frequency** (~400–484 THz) compared to **blue light** (~606–668 THz).  
   - A lower frequency corresponds to a longer wavelength.

4. **Conclusion:** All evidence (spectrum order, numerical ranges, and physics principles) confirms that red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

**Final Answer:**  
**Yes**.
