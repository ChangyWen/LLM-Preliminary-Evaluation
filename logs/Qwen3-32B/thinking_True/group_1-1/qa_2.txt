Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether J.M. Coetzee's "Summertime" was released later than Suzanne Collins's "Catching Fire." I need to figure out the publication dates of both books and compare them.

First, I should recall when "Catching Fire" came out. I know that the Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins started with "The Hunger Games" in 2008. "Catching Fire" is the second book in the series. I think it was released in 2010. Let me confirm that. Yes, "Catching Fire" was published in September 2009. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me check again. The first book was 2008, the second one was 2009, and the third was 2010. So "Catching Fire" came out in 2009.

Now, "Summertime" by J.M. Coetzee. I'm not as familiar with that one. I know Coetzee is a South African author who won the Nobel Prize. "Summertime" is a novel, I believe. Let me think. I think it was published in 2009 as well. Wait, but maybe it was 2010? Let me try to remember. Coetzee has written several books, like "Disgrace" and "Waiting for the Barbarians." "Summertime" is a more recent one. I think it was published in 2009. Let me check. Yes, "Summertime" was published in 2009. So both books were released in the same year. But the user is asking if "Summertime" was released later than "Catching Fire." If both are 2009, then I need to check the exact months.

"Catching Fire" was published in September 2009. "Summertime" by Coetzee was published in August 2009 in the UK, and then in the US in September 2009. Wait, so if the US release was September 2009, and "Catching Fire" was also September 2009, but maybe the exact dates differ. Let me check the exact publication dates. "Catching Fire" was released on September 1, 2009. "Summertime" in the US was September 8, 2009. So "Summertime" came out a week after "Catching Fire." Therefore, the answer would be yes, "Summertime" was released later than "Catching Fire."
