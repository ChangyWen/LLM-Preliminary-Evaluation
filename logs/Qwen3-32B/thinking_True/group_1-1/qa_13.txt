Okay, so I need to figure out if Garnavillo, IA is east of Newellton, LA. Let me start by recalling the states involved. Iowa (IA) is in the Midwestern United States, while Louisiana (LA) is in the southern part of the country. Generally, Iowa is to the north and west of Louisiana, but I need to be more precise.

First, I should find the approximate locations of both cities. Garnavillo is in Iowa. I know that Iowa is a state that's roughly in the Midwest, bordering the Mississippi River. Maybe Garnavillo is in the eastern part of Iowa? Because if it's in the eastern part, it might be closer to the Mississippi River, which could be east of some parts of Louisiana. Wait, but Louisiana is to the south of Iowa. So if Louisiana is south, then a city in eastern Iowa might be east of a city in Louisiana, but depending on their exact positions.

Newellton is in Louisiana. Louisiana's western part is near the Texas border, and the eastern part is near the Mississippi River. Newellton is in the northern part of Louisiana, I think. Let me try to remember or visualize a map. If Newellton is in northern Louisiana, then maybe it's west of the Mississippi River. Because the Mississippi divides Louisiana into east and west. So if Newellton is west of the river, then a city in Iowa, which is across the river, would be east of it. But Garnavillo is in Iowa. If Garnavillo is on the eastern side of Iowa, near the Mississippi, then it would be east of Newellton, LA if Newellton is west of the river. But I need to confirm the exact positions.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates. If I can get the approximate latitude and longitude of both cities, I can compare their longitudes. Since east is more positive longitude (assuming we're in the same hemisphere), if Garnavillo's longitude is higher than Newellton's, then it's east.

Let me try to recall or estimate their coordinates. Iowa's approximate longitude range is around 90°W to 96°W. Louisiana's longitude is around 91°W to 95°W. So if Garnavillo is in eastern Iowa, maybe around 92°W? Newellton, LA—if it's in northern Louisiana, maybe around 92°W as well? Wait, but if Newellton is west of the Mississippi, which runs roughly through central Louisiana, then maybe Newellton is around 93°W or so. Let me think. The Mississippi River in Louisiana is around 91°W to 92°W? No, actually, the river flows through the central part of Louisiana. For example, Baton Rouge is around 91°W, and New Orleans is around 90°W. So the river is more east in Louisiana. Therefore, if Newellton is in northern Louisiana, perhaps it's west of the river. So if the river is around 91.5°W, then Newellton might be around 92°W or 93°W. Meanwhile, Garnavillo, IA is in eastern Iowa, near the Mississippi River. Iowa's eastern border is around 91°W. So if Garnavillo is near the Mississippi in Iowa, its longitude would be around 91°W. So if Newellton is at 92°W, then Garnavillo (91°W) is east of Newellton (92°W). Because lower longitude numbers are east when in the same hemisphere. Wait, longitude is measured from the prime meridian. So a location with a lower west longitude is actually further east. For example, 90°W is east of 91°W. So if Garnavillo is at 91°W and Newellton is at 92°W, then Garnavillo is east of Newellton.

But I need to check if my approximations are correct. Let me try to get more precise. Let me think of cities in Iowa. Davenport, IA is on the Mississippi River, near the Illinois border. Its longitude is around 90.5°W. So if Garnavillo is in eastern Iowa, maybe near the Mississippi, perhaps around 91°W. Newellton, LA—I need to think of its location. Let me recall that Newellton is in Catahoula Parish, northern Louisiana. The Mississippi River flows through the central part of Louisiana, so Catahoula Parish is west of the river. Therefore, Newellton is west of the Mississippi. So if the river is around 91.5°W in that area, then Newellton would be west of that. Let's say Newellton is around 92.5°W. Then Garnavillo, IA at 91°W would be east of Newellton. So yes, Garnavillo is east of Newellton.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a map or a quick check. But since I can't look it up, I have to rely on my knowledge. Another way: if you imagine a map, Iowa is north of Louisiana. If you draw a line from Newellton, LA northward, would Garnavillo be to the east of that line? If Newellton is west of the Mississippi, then moving north from there would cross the Mississippi into Iowa. So if Garnavillo is on the eastern side of Iowa (east of the Mississippi), then it would be east of Newellton. But if Newellton is west of the river, and Garnavillo is east of the river in Iowa, then yes, Garnavillo is east of Newellton.

So putting it all together: Garnavillo, IA is in eastern Iowa, near the Mississippi River. Newellton, LA is in northern Louisiana, west of the Mississippi River. Therefore, Garnavillo is east of Newellton.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Understand the States' Positions:**
   - Iowa (IA) is in the Midwestern U.S., bordering the Mississippi River to the east.
   - Louisiana (LA) is in the southern U.S., with the Mississippi River dividing it into eastern and western regions.

2. **Locate the Cities:**
   - **Garnavillo, IA** is in eastern Iowa, near the Mississippi River. Its approximate longitude is around **91°W**.
   - **Newellton, LA** is in northern Louisiana, west of the Mississippi River. Its approximate longitude is around **92.5°W**.

3. **Compare Longitudes:**
   - Lower west longitude values indicate positions further east. Since **91°W (Garnavillo)** is east of **92.5°W (Newellton)**, Garnavillo is east of Newellton.

4. **Geographic Context:**
   - The Mississippi River flows through central Louisiana. Newellton lies west of the river, while Garnavillo is on the eastern side of Iowa (across the river). This confirms Garnavillo's eastern position relative to Newellton.

**Final Answer:**  
Yes.
