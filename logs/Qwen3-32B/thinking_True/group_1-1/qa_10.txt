Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the Beastie Boys' song "Jimmy James" was released earlier than Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under." I need to figure out the release dates of both songs and compare them.

First, I should recall or look up when the Beastie Boys released "Jimmy James." I know the Beastie Boys were active in the 80s and 90s. "Jimmy James" is from their album "Licensed to Ill," which I think came out in 1986. Let me confirm that. Yes, "Licensed to Ill" was released in November 1986. "Jimmy James" is the third track on that album, so the song was released in 1986.

Next, Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under." Dream Theater is a progressive metal band that started in the late 80s. Their debut album is "When Dream and Day Unite," which was released in 1989. "Pull Me Under" is the first track on that album. So the song came out in 1989.

Comparing the two release years: 1986 (Beastie Boys) vs. 1989 (Dream Theater). 1986 is earlier than 1989, so "Jimmy James" was released first. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.
