Okay, so I need to figure out if Cambria County, Pennsylvania is located west of Cattaraugus County, New York. Let me start by recalling the general geography of Pennsylvania and New York. 

First, I know that Pennsylvania is to the south of New York. So, if I imagine a map, New York is up north, and Pennsylvania is just below it. Now, the question is about specific counties in each state. 

Cambria County, PA. Hmm, I think Pennsylvania has several counties along the Ohio River, like Allegheny, Butler, and maybe Cambria is one of them. Wait, I remember that Johnstown is a city in Cambria County. Johnstown is in western Pennsylvania, right? So that would place Cambria County in the western part of PA.

Now, Cattaraugus County, NY. New York has counties too. Cattaraugus County... I think that's in western New York. Maybe near the Pennsylvania border? Because the question is about whether Cambria is west of it. If Cattaraugus is in western NY, and Cambria is in western PA, which is south of NY, then maybe their positions relative to each other need to be checked.

Let me think about the borders. Pennsylvania and New York share a border in the west. So, if Cattaraugus County is in western NY, near the PA border, then Cambria County in PA would be just south of it. But the question is about whether Cambria is west of Cattaraugus. So, if Cattaraugus is in western NY, and Cambria is in western PA, which is south, then maybe Cambria is to the southwest of Cattaraugus? Or maybe they are adjacent?

Wait, I should check the exact locations. Let me try to visualize a map. Western New York includes areas like Buffalo, Erie, and maybe Cattaraugus County is near the Pennsylvania line. If Cattaraugus is in the southern part of western NY, then Cambria County in PA would be just south of it. But the direction west would be to the left on the map. So if Cattaraugus is in NY, and Cambria is in PA, which is south, then Cambria would be to the south, not west. Unless Cattaraugus is further east, and Cambria is further west. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the longitude. If I can figure out the approximate longitudes of both counties, that would help. Let me recall that Pennsylvania is generally east of the Mississippi River, but within Pennsylvania, western counties would have lower longitudes (more west). For example, Pittsburgh is in Allegheny County, which is in western PA. Johnstown is further east than Pittsburgh? Wait, no, Johnstown is in western PA, maybe near the Ohio border. So Cambria County is in western PA, near the Ohio River. 

Cattaraugus County, NY is in the southern part of western NY, bordering Pennsylvania and New York. The southern part of NY is near Pennsylvania. So if Cattaraugus County is in the southern part of western NY, then Cambria County in PA would be just south of it. But the question is about west. So if Cattaraugus is in NY, and Cambria is in PA, which is south, then Cambria is to the south, not west. Unless Cattaraugus is further east. 

Wait, maybe I should think of specific cities. Cattaraugus County includes the city of Salamanca, I think. And Cambria County has Johnstown. If I look at a map, Johnstown is in western PA, near the Ohio border. Salamanca, NY is in western NY, near the Pennsylvania border. So if I imagine a map, Salamanca is in the southern part of NY, near the PA line. Johnstown is just south of that. So Cambria County is south of Cattaraugus County. Therefore, Cambria is to the south, not west. But maybe they are aligned in longitude? If Cattaraugus County is in the western part of NY, then Cambria County in PA would be west of it? Wait, no. If Cattaraugus is in western NY, then to the west of it would be into New York, not Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is to the south. So if you go west from Cattaraugus County, you'd be in New York, not Pennsylvania. Therefore, Cambria County, being in PA, is to the south of Cattaraugus, not west. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up directions. Let me think again. If you're in Cattaraugus County, NY, and you go west, you'd be heading towards the center of New York State? No, western NY is already the western part. So west of Cattaraugus County would be into the interior of NY, but Cattaraugus is already on the western edge. Wait, no. The westernmost part of New York is near the Niagara Falls area, bordering Ontario, Canada. So Cattaraugus County is more to the south of that. So if Cattaraugus is in southern western NY, then west of it would be towards the center of NY, but Pennsylvania is to the south. So Cambria County is south of Cattaraugus, not west. Therefore, the answer would be No, Cambria County is not west of Cattaraugus County; it's south of it. 

But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should check the approximate longitudes. Let me try to recall. Pittsburgh, PA is around 40.44° N, 79.99° W. Johnstown, PA is around 40.47° N, 78.89° W. So Johnstown is further west than Pittsburgh. Now, Salamanca, NY is around 42.13° N, 79.03° W. Wait, that's interesting. So Salamanca, NY is at 79.03° W, and Johnstown, PA is at 78.89° W. So Johnstown is further west than Salamanca. Therefore, Cambria County (Johnstown) is west of Cattaraugus County (Salamanca). Wait, that would mean the answer is Yes. 

Wait, but the latitude of Salamanca is higher (42.13° N) compared to Johnstown (40.47° N), so Salamanca is further north. But longitude-wise, Johnstown is at 78.89° W, which is west of Salamanca's 79.03° W. Because lower longitude numbers are further west. Wait, no. Wait, longitude increases as you go east. So 79.03° W is further west than 78.89° W? No, that's not right. Wait, if you have a longitude of 79° W and 78° W, the 78° W is further west. Because as you go west, the degrees increase? No, wait. Longitude is measured from the prime meridian. So 0° is the prime meridian. Moving east, degrees increase up to 180°, and moving west, degrees increase up to 180°. So 79° W is further west than 78° W. Wait, no. Wait, if you're at 79° W, that's 79 degrees west of the prime meridian. 78° W is 78 degrees west. So 79° W is further west than 78° W. Therefore, if Salamanca is at 79.03° W, and Johnstown is at 78.89° W, then Salamanca is further west than Johnstown. Therefore, Johnstown is east of Salamanca. Therefore, Cambria County is east of Cattaraugus County. Therefore, the answer would be No, Cambria County is not west of Cattaraugus County. 

Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify. Let's take two points: one at 79° W and another at 78° W. The one at 79° W is further west because it's 79 degrees from the prime meridian, which is more west than 78 degrees. So if Salamanca is at 79.03° W, and Johnstown is at 78.89° W, then Salamanca is further west. Therefore, Johnstown is east of Salamanca. Therefore, Cambria County (Johnstown) is east of Cattaraugus County (Salamanca). Therefore, the answer is No, Cambria County is not west of Cattaraugus County. 

But earlier I thought that Johnstown is further west, but that was a mistake in understanding longitude. So the correct answer is No. Cambria County is east of Cattaraugus County. Therefore, the answer is No.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Locations:**
   - **Cambria County, PA** is in western Pennsylvania, near the Ohio River. Its major city, Johnstown, is located at approximately **40.47° N, 78.89° W**.
   - **Cattaraugus County, NY** is in southern western New York, bordering Pennsylvania. Its major city, Salamanca, is located at approximately **42.13° N, 79.03° W**.

2. **Compare Longitudes:**
   - Longitude measures east-west position. A **lower longitude value (e.g., 78.89° W)** indicates a **more western** location.
   - **Johnstown (78.89° W)** is **east** of **Salamanca (79.03° W)** because 78.89° W is closer to the prime meridian (0°) than 79.03° W.

3. **Geographic Relationship:**
   - Since Johnstown (Cambria County) is **east** of Salamanca (Cattaraugus County), Cambria County is **not west** of Cattaraugus County. Instead, it lies **south and east** of it.

**Final Answer:**  
**No.** Cambria County, PA is not located west of Cattaraugus County, NY. It is situated to the **south and east** of Cattaraugus County.
