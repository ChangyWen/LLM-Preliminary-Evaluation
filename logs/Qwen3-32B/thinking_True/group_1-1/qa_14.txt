Okay, so I need to figure out if Arbuckle, California is less populous than Pickens, South Carolina. Let me start by recalling what I know about these places. 

First, I know that California is a large state with many cities, but I'm not sure about the specific population of Arbuckle. Similarly, South Carolina has various towns, and Pickens is one of them. I don't remember the exact populations off the top of my head, so I'll need to think about how to approach this.

Maybe I can start by checking if these are incorporated cities or just census-designated places. Sometimes, the population can vary depending on the boundaries. For example, some places might have a small population if they're a small town, while others might be part of a larger area. 

I think Arbuckle, CA is a small town. I've heard of it in the context of being a quiet, rural area. Maybe it's in the Sierra Nevada region? If that's the case, it's probably a small community. On the other hand, Pickens, SC—I'm not as familiar with. South Carolina has several towns named Pickens, but I think the main one is in Pickens County. I should verify if there's a city named Pickens in South Carolina. 

Let me try to recall or think of sources. The U.S. Census Bureau provides population data, so that's a reliable source. But since I can't look it up right now, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge or approximate numbers. 

I remember that many small towns in California have populations under 10,000. For example, places like Grass Valley or Nevada City are in that range. If Arbuckle is similar, maybe it's around 1,000 to 5,000 people. 

As for Pickens, SC, I think it's a bit larger. South Carolina's towns can vary, but if Pickens is a county seat, it might have a larger population. For example, some county seats in South Carolina have populations in the tens of thousands. However, I'm not sure if Pickens is a county seat. Wait, Pickens County's seat is actually Pickens, SC. So if that's the case, the city of Pickens might be the county seat and have a population around 10,000 or more. 

Alternatively, maybe the city of Pickens is smaller. Let me think. I know that in 2020, the population of Pickens, SC was estimated to be around 10,000. But I'm not certain. If that's the case, and Arbuckle, CA is around 1,000, then yes, Arbuckle is less populous. 

But I need to be careful. Let me try to cross-reference. Another approach is to think of nearby cities. For example, if Arbuckle is near Placerville, CA, which is in El Dorado County, and if Placerville has a population of around 10,000, then Arbuckle, being a smaller town, might be much smaller. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the 2020 Census data. If I can't look it up, I have to rely on approximate numbers. Let's say Arbuckle, CA has a population of around 1,500. Pickens, SC, as a county seat, might have around 10,000. So in that case, yes, Arbuckle is less populous. 

But wait, I should also consider that sometimes the population numbers can be tricky. For example, if Pickens, SC is part of a larger metropolitan area, but the city itself is small. However, if it's the county seat, it's likely to have a moderate population. 

Another angle: I can think of other small towns in California. For example, the town of Murphys, CA has a population of around 1,000. If Arbuckle is similar, then it's in that range. 

In South Carolina, towns like Pickens might be comparable to other small cities. For example, if Pickens has a population of 10,000, that's significantly larger than 1,500. 

So, based on this reasoning, I would conclude that Arbuckle, CA is less populous than Pickens, SC. Therefore, the answer is Yes.
