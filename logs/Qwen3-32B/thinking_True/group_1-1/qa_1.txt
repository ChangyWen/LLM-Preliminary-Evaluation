Okay, so I need to figure out if Peter Hitchens's "The Abolition of Britain" is shorter than Mo Hayder's "Birdman." Let me start by recalling what I know about these books. 

First, I should check the page counts of both books. I don't remember the exact numbers off the top of my head, so I might need to look them up. But since I can't actually access the internet right now, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge or make educated guesses based on the authors and genres.

Peter Hitchens is a British journalist and author known for his political commentary. "The Abolition of Britain" is a non-fiction book that discusses the decline of British society and culture. Non-fiction books can vary in length, but political commentaries might be around 200-300 pages. I think I've heard that this book is around 300 pages, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think... Maybe it's a bit longer? Or maybe shorter? I'm not certain.

On the other hand, Mo Hayder is a crime fiction author. "Birdman" is a psychological thriller. Crime novels often range from 300 to 500 pages, depending on the complexity. I believe "Birdman" is a shorter novel, maybe around 250-300 pages. I remember that some of her other books are in that range. For example, "The Treatment" is about 300 pages. So "Birdman" might be similar.

Wait, but I should be careful here. If "The Abolition of Britain" is a non-fiction book, it might have more chapters or sections, but the page count could be similar to a novel. Let me try to recall specific editions. The hardcover edition of "The Abolition of Britain" published by Continuum in 2002 has 304 pages. That's what I remember. If that's the case, then "Birdman" by Mo Hayder, published by HarperCollins in 2003, is a paperback that I think is around 288 pages. Wait, but sometimes page counts can vary between editions. For example, a hardcover might have more pages than a paperback, but that's not always the case. 

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the average page counts for each genre. Non-fiction political books might be a bit longer, but crime novels can vary. If "The Abolition of Britain" is 304 pages and "Birdman" is 288, then the answer would be no, because 304 is more than 288. But if "Birdman" is longer, then the answer would be yes. 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to verify. I think "The Abolition of Britain" is indeed around 300 pages. For "Birdman," I recall that it's a shorter novel, maybe 250-270 pages. If that's the case, then "The Abolition of Britain" would be longer. But I need to be precise. 

Another angle: check the authors' other works. Peter Hitchens has written other non-fiction books, like "The Rage Against God," which is around 300 pages. So it's plausible that "The Abolition of Britain" is similar in length. Mo Hayder's "Birdman" is a standalone novel, and given the genre, it's likely to be in the 250-300 page range. 

Wait, I think I remember that "Birdman" is 288 pages. If "The Abolition of Britain" is 304, then the answer would be no. But if "Birdman" is, say, 250 pages, then "The Abolition of Britain" is longer. 

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the word count. Non-fiction books can have different word counts per page compared to fiction. But that's more complicated. 

I think the key here is to get the exact page counts. From what I remember, "The Abolition of Britain" is 304 pages in the hardcover edition. "Birdman" is 288 pages in the paperback. Therefore, "The Abolition of Britain" is longer. So the answer would be No, it's not shorter. 

But wait, I'm not 100% sure about the exact numbers. Maybe I should double-check. If I can't, I have to go with my best guess based on prior knowledge. Given that, I'll proceed with the numbers I have in mind.
