Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether Elliot Silverstein's "Nightmare Honeymoon" was released later than Peter R. Hunt's "Gold." I need to figure out the release dates of both movies to compare them.

First, I should recall or look up the release years for both films. I know that "Gold" is a 1974 film directed by Peter R. Hunt. It's a thriller about a gold heist, starring Tony Curtis and Robert Wagner. That one definitely came out in the mid-70s.

Now, "Nightmare Honeymoon" by Elliot Silverstein. I'm not as familiar with this one. Let me think. Elliot Silverstein directed some movies in the 60s and 70s. "Nightmare Honeymoon" might be from the late 60s or early 70s. Wait, I think it was released in 1968. Let me confirm that. Yes, "Nightmare Honeymoon" came out in 1968. It's a horror film starring Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr.

So, "Nightmare Honeymoon" is 1968, and "Gold" is 1974. Comparing the two, 1968 is earlier than 1974. Therefore, "Nightmare Honeymoon" was released before "Gold," not after. The answer should be No.
