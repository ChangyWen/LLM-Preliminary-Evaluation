Okay, so I need to figure out if The University of Tampa in Florida is located north of Schiller International University in Florida. Let me start by recalling the locations of both universities.

First, The University of Tampa. I know that Tampa is a city in Florida, and the university is named after it. So, The University of Tampa is in Tampa, FL. Now, Schiller International University—I'm not as familiar with. I think it's also in Florida, but I'm not sure of the exact city. Maybe it's in a different part of the state?

I should check the locations of both universities. Let me think. The University of Tampa is in Tampa, which is in Hillsborough County. Now, Schiller International University—I might have to recall if I've heard of it before. Wait, I think Schiller International University is actually in Fort Lauderdale or maybe another city in South Florida. Or is it in Tampa as well? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's in a different state, but the user specified Florida, so it's in FL.

Wait, I should verify. Let me try to remember. Schiller International University—I think it's in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. If that's the case, then Fort Lauderdale is in Broward County, which is south of Hillsborough County where Tampa is. So if The University of Tampa is in Tampa and Schiller is in Fort Lauderdale, then Tampa is north of Fort Lauderdale. Therefore, the answer would be yes.

But wait, I need to be sure. Let me think again. Fort Lauderdale is part of the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area, which is in South Florida. Tampa is in West Central Florida. So geographically, Tampa is north of Miami and Fort Lauderdale. So if Schiller International University is in Fort Lauderdale, then The University of Tampa is indeed north of it.

Alternatively, if Schiller International University is in another city in Florida, like Gainesville or Tallahassee, that would change things. But I don't think it's in Gainesville, which is where the University of Florida is. Let me confirm the location of Schiller International University. I think it's in Fort Lauderdale. Let me check my memory. Yes, I believe Schiller International University is located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Therefore, since Fort Lauderdale is south of Tampa, The University of Tampa is north of Schiller International University.

So the answer should be yes.
