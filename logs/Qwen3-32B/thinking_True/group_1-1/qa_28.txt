Okay, so I need to figure out if Þórisvatn has a smaller area than Lake Tohopekaliga. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two lakes. 

First, Þórisvatn. I think that's a lake in Iceland. I remember Iceland has a lot of volcanic lakes, maybe even some craters. I'm not exactly sure about the size, but I can try to look up the area. Wait, but since I can't actually look it up right now, I need to rely on my memory or any known facts. Maybe Þórisvatn is a smaller lake? I've heard of other Icelandic lakes like Þingvallavatn, which is the largest, but Þórisvatn might be smaller.

Then there's Lake Tohopekaliga, often called Lake Toho. I know it's in Florida, USA. Florida has many lakes, and Tohopekaliga is one of the larger ones. I think it's a significant lake in terms of size. I recall that Lake Toho is one of the largest lakes in Florida, maybe around 20,000 to 30,000 acres? Wait, but I need to be careful with the exact numbers. Let me think. If I remember correctly, Lake Tohopekaliga has an area of approximately 20,000 acres. 

Now, for Þórisvatn, I'm not as certain. Let me try to recall. Icelandic lakes vary in size. Some are quite large, like Þingvallavatn, which is about 83 square kilometers. But Þórisvatn is probably smaller. Maybe around 10 square kilometers? Wait, but I need to convert units to compare them. If Lake Toho is 20,000 acres, let's convert that to square kilometers. 

1 acre is approximately 0.004047 square kilometers. So 20,000 acres would be 20,000 * 0.004047 = 80.94 square kilometers. So Lake Toho is about 81 square kilometers. 

If Þórisvatn is around 10 square kilometers, then yes, it's smaller. But I need to be sure about Þórisvatn's size. Wait, maybe I can think of other Icelandic lakes. For example, Lake Mývatn is about 18 square kilometers. If Þórisvatn is smaller than that, then it's definitely smaller than Lake Toho. But I'm not sure if Þórisvatn is smaller than Mývatn. Alternatively, maybe Þórisvatn is a crater lake, which are often smaller. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the area in square miles. Lake Toho is 20,000 acres. Since 1 square mile is 640 acres, 20,000 acres is 20,000 / 640 = 31.25 square miles. If Þórisvatn is, say, 5 square kilometers, converting that to square miles: 1 square kilometer is about 0.3861 square miles, so 5 * 0.3861 ≈ 1.93 square miles. That's way smaller than 31.25. 

But I need to get the actual numbers. Wait, maybe I can recall that Þórisvatn is in the Þórsmörk area, which is a valley in Iceland. I think it's a relatively small lake. Let me try to remember if there's any data. For example, if Þórisvatn is about 10 square kilometers, then yes, it's smaller than Lake Toho's 81 square kilometers. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the area in square miles. If Þórisvatn is 10 square kilometers, that's about 3.86 square miles. Lake Toho is 31.25 square miles. So yes, Þórisvatn is smaller. 

But I need to be precise. Let me try to recall exact numbers. Wait, I think Þórisvatn has an area of approximately 10 square kilometers. Lake Tohopekaliga is 20,000 acres, which is 80.94 square kilometers. Therefore, Þórisvatn is smaller. 

Alternatively, maybe I can check if there's any other source. For example, if I remember that Lake Toho is one of the largest lakes in the US, and Þórisvatn is a small Icelandic lake, then the answer is likely yes. 

So, based on the area conversion and the approximate sizes I can recall, Þórisvatn is smaller than Lake Tohopekaliga.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Lakes:**
   - **Þórisvatn:** A lake in Iceland, likely a smaller volcanic or crater lake.
   - **Lake Tohopekaliga (Lake Toho):** A large lake in Florida, USA.

2. **Estimate Areas:**
   - **Lake Tohopekaliga:** 
     - Known to be approximately **20,000 acres**.
     - Convert to square kilometers:  
       $ 20,000 \, \text{acres} \times 0.004047 \, \text{km}^2/\text{acre} \approx 80.94 \, \text{km}^2 $.
   - **Þórisvatn:** 
     - Estimated to be around **10 km²** (based on comparisons to other Icelandic lakes like Mývatn, which is ~18 km²).

3. **Comparison:**
   - Þórisvatn (~10 km²) is significantly smaller than Lake Tohopekaliga (~81 km²).

**Final Answer:**  
Yes.
