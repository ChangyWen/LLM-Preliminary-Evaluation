Okay, so I need to figure out whether Anastasia of Sirmium lived longer than William II, Count of Chalon. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two historical figures. 

First, Anastasia of Sirmium. I think she was a saint, maybe from the early Christian period. Sirmium was an ancient city in what is now Serbia, right? I remember that there were several saints from that area. Anastasia might have been a martyr. I'm not sure about her exact dates, but martyrs from the Roman Empire period usually died in the 3rd or 4th century. Let me check that. Wait, I think Saint Anastasia the Martyr of Sirmium is venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Her feast day is on December 17th. But when did she live? I think she was martyred during the reign of Emperor Diocletian, which was around the late 3rd to early 4th century. So maybe she died around 304 AD? If she was a young woman when martyred, her lifespan would be, say, 25 years or so. But I'm not certain about her exact birth and death years.

Now, William II, Count of Chalon. The Counts of Chalon were a French noble family. William II might have lived in the 12th or 13th century. Let me think. The Counts of Chalon were prominent in Burgundy. William II of Chalon might have been a 12th-century figure. For example, William I of Chalon was Count from 1097 to 1127. So William II would be his successor. If William II was Count from, say, 1127 to 1150, then he would have died around 1150. But I need to confirm his exact dates. Alternatively, maybe he was a different William II. Let me check. Wait, there's a William II of Chalon who was a Crusader. He was born around 1130 and died in 1177. If that's the case, he lived to be about 47 years old. But I need to verify this.

So, if Anastasia died around 304 AD at, say, 25 years old, and William II died in 1177 at 47, then William lived longer. But wait, maybe Anastasia's lifespan is not known exactly. If she was a martyr, her death date is known, but her birth date is not. So perhaps she lived to be 30 or 40? But without exact dates, it's hard to say. However, if William II lived to 47, and Anastasia's lifespan is estimated to be, say, 30, then William lived longer. But if Anastasia's lifespan is unknown, maybe she lived longer? Wait, but martyrs are usually young, so maybe not. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another Anastasia of Sirmium. Let me check. Saint Anastasia of Sirmium is indeed a 4th-century saint, martyred under Diocletian. Her exact dates are not well-documented, but she's often associated with the early 4th century. If she was, say, 30 when martyred in 304, she lived to 30. William II of Chalon, if he died in 1177 at 47, then yes, he lived longer. 

But I need to make sure about William II's dates. Let me think again. The Counts of Chalon: William I (1097-1127), William II (1127-1150), William III (1150-1177). Wait, so William II would have died in 1150. If he was born, say, in 1100, he would be 50 when he died. But if he was born later, maybe 1120, then he died at 30. Wait, this is conflicting. Maybe I need to look up the exact dates. 

Alternatively, perhaps the William II of Chalon who was a Crusader is a different one. Let me check. There's a William II of Chalon who was a participant in the Second Crusade. He was born around 1130 and died in 1177. So if he was born in 1130 and died in 1177, that's 47 years. So he lived 47 years. 

Anastasia of Sirmium, if she was martyred in 304 AD, and assuming she was in her 20s or 30s, then her lifespan would be around 25-35 years. So William II lived longer. 

Therefore, the answer would be Yes, William II lived longer than Anastasia of Sirmium.
