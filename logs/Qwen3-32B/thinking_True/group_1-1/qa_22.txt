Okay, so I need to figure out if Lake Martin in Alabama is located south of the Dal-Tex Building in Texas. Let me start by recalling the locations of these places. 

First, Lake Martin is in Alabama. I know Alabama is in the southeastern United States. The Dal-Tex Building is in Texas, which is to the west of Alabama. But I need to be more precise. 

I should probably get the approximate coordinates of both places. Let me think. Lake Martin is a reservoir, so maybe it's in the central or eastern part of Alabama. I remember that Lake Martin is near the towns of Alexander City or Saks, which are in Tallapoosa County. Let me check the latitude of Lake Martin. If I recall, Alabama's latitude ranges from about 30°N to 35°N. Lake Martin is probably around 32°N to 33°N. 

Now, the Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, Texas. Dallas is in the northern part of Texas. The latitude of Dallas is approximately 32.7767°N. So if Lake Martin is around 32.5°N, then it would be slightly south of Dallas. Wait, but I need to confirm the exact coordinates. 

Let me think again. If Lake Martin is in Tallapoosa County, Alabama, which is in the central part of the state, maybe around 32.5°N to 33°N. Dallas is at about 32.78°N. So if Lake Martin is at 32.5°N, that's about 0.28 degrees south of Dallas. Since each degree of latitude is roughly 69 miles, that's about 19 miles south. So yes, Lake Martin would be south of Dallas. But wait, the Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, so if Dallas is at 32.78°N, and Lake Martin is at 32.5°N, then Lake Martin is indeed south of Dallas. 

But I should double-check the exact coordinates. Let me try to recall or estimate. Lake Martin's coordinates: I think it's around 32.5°N, 85.5°W. Dallas is at 32.78°N, 96.80°W. So latitude-wise, Lake Martin is at 32.5°N, Dallas is at 32.78°N. So Lake Martin is about 0.28 degrees south of Dallas. Therefore, yes, Lake Martin is south of the Dal-Tex Building in Dallas. 

Wait, but I need to make sure that the Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas. Yes, the Dal-Tex Building is a historic building in downtown Dallas. So if Dallas is at 32.78°N, then the building is there. So Lake Martin is south of that. 

Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Locations:**
   - **Lake Martin, AL:** A reservoir in Tallapoosa County, Alabama, approximately at **32.5°N latitude**.
   - **Dal-Tex Building, TX:** A historic building in **Dallas, Texas**, located at **32.78°N latitude**.

2. **Compare Latitudes:**
   - Latitude measures north-south position. A lower latitude means a location is farther south.
   - Lake Martin (32.5°N) has a **lower latitude** than the Dal-Tex Building (32.78°N).

3. **Calculate the Difference:**
   - The difference in latitude is **0.28°**, which translates to roughly **19 miles** (0.28 × 69 miles/degree).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since Lake Martin is **south** of Dallas (and the Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas), the answer is **Yes**.

**Final Answer:** Yes.
