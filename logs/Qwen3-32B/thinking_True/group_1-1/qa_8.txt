Okay, so I need to figure out if Yao Shu was born earlier than Alfonso of Molina. Let me start by recalling who these two people are. 

First, Yao Shu. I think he was a Chinese general or maybe a military leader from the Tang Dynasty. I remember that the Tang Dynasty was around 618 to 907 AD. But I'm not exactly sure about Yao Shu's specific dates. Maybe he was active during the An Lushan Rebellion? That was in the 8th century, so maybe he was born in the 700s?

Then there's Alfonso of Molina. I'm not as familiar with him. The name "Molina" makes me think of Spain, maybe the Kingdom of Castile or something. Alfonso... perhaps Alfonso X of Castile? Wait, no, Alfonso X was the Wise, who lived in the 13th century. But maybe Alfonso of Molina is a different person. Let me think. There was a figure named Alfonso of Molina who was a 12th-century Castilian nobleman. He was involved in the Reconquista, right? Maybe he was a military leader or a count. I think he was active during the reign of Alfonso VII of Castile, which would be around the 1100s. So if he was active in the 12th century, he was probably born in the 1100s.

Now, comparing the two. If Yao Shu was from the Tang Dynasty, which ended in 907 AD, and Alfonso of Molina was born in the 1100s, then Yao Shu would have been born earlier. But wait, I need to confirm the exact birth years. Let me try to recall or think of sources. 

Yao Shu is a historical figure from the Tang Dynasty. I think he was born in 688 AD. Wait, no, that might be someone else. Let me check my memory. The An Lushan Rebellion was in 755 AD. If Yao Shu was a general during that time, he might have been born in the early 700s. For example, if he was active in his 30s during 755, he might have been born around 725. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe he was born later. 

Alfonso of Molina, on the other hand, was a 12th-century figure. If he was active in the 1100s, he was probably born in the 1000s. Wait, no, the 12th century is 1101-1200. So if he was, say, 30 in 1150, he was born around 1120. So if Yao Shu was born in the 700s, then yes, he was born earlier. But I need to get the exact dates.

Wait, maybe I can look up the exact birth years. But since I can't access external sources, I have to rely on my memory. Let me think again. Yao Shu is a name that might be associated with the Tang Dynasty. The Tang Dynasty ended in 907, so if he was born in the 8th or 9th century, that's before the 12th century. Alfonso of Molina, being a 12th-century figure, would have been born in the 1100s. So even if Yao Shu was born in the 9th century (say 800 AD), that's still earlier than 1100s. Therefore, the answer would be yes, Yao Shu was born earlier than Alfonso of Molina.

But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the names. Let me confirm. Alfonso of Molina is also known as Alfonso the Brave, and he was a count of Molina in the 12th century. His birth year is often cited as around 1105. If that's the case, then even if Yao Shu was born in the 9th century, he would be earlier. But if Yao Shu was born in the 10th century, say 900 AD, that's still before 1105. So regardless, the answer is yes.
