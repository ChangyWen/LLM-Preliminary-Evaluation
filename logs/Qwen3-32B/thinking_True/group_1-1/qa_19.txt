Okay, so I need to figure out if Eau Claire County, Wisconsin is more populous than Platte County, Missouri. Let me start by recalling what I know about these counties. 

First, I know that population can vary a lot between different states and counties. I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers for these two, so I'll need to look them up or estimate based on what I remember. Let me think about the cities in these counties. 

Eau Claire County is in Wisconsin, and the main city there is Eau Claire. I remember that Eau Claire is a mid-sized city, maybe around 100,000 people? But that's just the city. The county population would be larger. I think the county might be around 150,000 to 200,000 people. 

Now, Platte County in Missouri. I know that Platte County is where St. Charles is located, which is a growing suburb of St. Louis. St. Charles itself is a bit larger than Eau Claire, maybe 70,000? But again, the county population would be more. I've heard that Platte County has been growing rapidly in recent years. Maybe the county is around 200,000 to 250,000? 

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to recall some data. The U.S. Census Bureau has population estimates. For 2020, Eau Claire County's population was approximately 105,000. Wait, no, that's the city. The county as a whole might be around 150,000. Let me check my memory. I think the 2020 estimate for Eau Claire County was about 105,000. Wait, no, that seems low. Maybe I'm confusing the city and county numbers. 

Wait, the city of Eau Claire has a population of around 67,000. The county would include surrounding areas. So maybe the county is around 150,000. Let me think. If the city is 67k, and the county has other towns, maybe the total is around 150k. 

For Platte County, Missouri, I think the population is higher. St. Charles is a major city there, and the county has been growing. I believe the 2020 estimate for Platte County was around 210,000. So if Eau Claire County is around 150k and Platte County is 210k, then Platte County is more populous. 

But I need to be careful here. Let me try to verify. Another way is to think about the state populations. Wisconsin's total population is around 5.8 million, and Missouri is around 6.1 million. But that's not directly helpful. 

Alternatively, I can think of other counties in similar-sized states. For example, in Wisconsin, Dane County (Madison) is much larger, but Eau Claire is a smaller county. In Missouri, Platte County is one of the more populous counties, especially with the growth near St. Louis. 

Wait, I think I remember that Platte County's population is over 200,000. Let me check my memory again. If Eau Claire County is around 105,000, then Platte County would be more populous. But I'm not 100% sure. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the 2020 U.S. Census estimates. Let me try to recall. The 2020 population for Eau Claire County, WI was approximately 105,000. Wait, no, that's the city. The county's population is higher. Let me think. If the city is 67k, and the county has other areas, maybe the total is around 150k. 

For Platte County, MO, the 2020 population was around 210,000. So if Eau Claire County is 150k and Platte County is 210k, then the answer is No, Eau Claire County is less populous. 

But I need to be precise. Let me try to recall exact numbers. I think the 2020 estimate for Eau Claire County was 105,000. Wait, no, that's the city. The county's population is higher. Let me check. 

Wait, according to the U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts, as of July 1, 2023, the population of Eau Claire County, WI is 105,000. Wait, that can't be right. The city of Eau Claire is 67k, so the county must be higher. Maybe the 2023 estimate is 105k for the county? That seems low. Maybe I'm mixing up the data. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 2020 estimate for Eau Claire County was 105,000. If that's the case, then Platte County, MO with 210k would be more populous. 

But I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe I can compare the two counties based on their rankings in their respective states. 

In Wisconsin, Eau Claire County is not one of the most populous. The most populous counties are Milwaukee, Dane, and Outagamie. Eau Claire is probably in the middle or lower half. 

In Missouri, Platte County is one of the more populous counties, especially with the growth in the St. Louis metropolitan area. So it's likely that Platte County has a larger population than Eau Claire County. 

Therefore, the answer is No, Eau Claire County is not more populous than Platte County.
