Okay, so I need to figure out if Williamsburg in Manhattan is located south of the Hillman Houses in Manhattan. Hmm, first, I should probably confirm the locations of both Williamsburg and the Hillman Houses within Manhattan. Wait, but I remember that Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Is that right? Let me think. Manhattan is one of the five boroughs of New York City, and Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. So if the user is asking about Williamsburg in Manhattan, maybe there's a confusion here. But the question specifically says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," so maybe they're referring to a different Williamsburg within Manhattan? Or perhaps it's a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe there's a place called Williamsburg in Manhattan. Let me check. I know that Manhattan has neighborhoods like Lower East Side, Upper East Side, etc. I don't recall a Williamsburg in Manhattan. The Williamsburg Bridge connects Manhattan to Brooklyn, and the neighborhood of Williamsburg is on the Brooklyn side. So if the user is referring to the actual Williamsburg neighborhood, it's in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Therefore, the question might be based on a misunderstanding. 

Now, the Hillman Houses. I think the Hillman Houses are a public housing complex in Manhattan. Let me recall. The Hillman Houses are located in the East Harlem area of Manhattan. So if Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, then it's definitely not in Manhattan, so the question is a bit off. But if the user is asking whether the actual Williamsburg (in Brooklyn) is south of the Hillman Houses (in Manhattan), then we need to consider the geography between Brooklyn and Manhattan. 

Manhattan is the island in the middle, with Brooklyn to the west of it. The Hillman Houses in East Harlem are in northern Manhattan. Williamsburg in Brooklyn is across the East River from Manhattan. So if you look at a map, the Hillman Houses are in the northern part of Manhattan, and Williamsburg is in the northern part of Brooklyn. Since Brooklyn is to the west of Manhattan, and the Hillman Houses are in the north of Manhattan, Williamsburg would be to the west of Manhattan, not south. Wait, but the question is about whether Williamsburg (Manhattan) is south of Hillman Houses (Manhattan). But if Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn, then the answer would be no, because Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan. However, if there's a Williamsburg in Manhattan, I need to find that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is confused and meant to ask about a different location. Let me verify the exact locations. 

First, confirm Williamsburg's location: Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City. It's known for its artsy vibe and is across the East River from Manhattan. 

Hillman Houses: The Hillman Houses are a public housing complex located in East Harlem, Manhattan. They are in the northern part of Manhattan. 

So if the question is whether Williamsburg (Brooklyn) is south of Hillman Houses (Manhattan), then we need to see the relative positions. Since Manhattan is an island, and Brooklyn is to the west, the Hillman Houses are in the northern part of Manhattan. Williamsburg is in the northern part of Brooklyn. So if you imagine Manhattan and Brooklyn, the Hillman Houses are in the north of Manhattan, and Williamsburg is in the north of Brooklyn. Since Brooklyn is to the west of Manhattan, Williamsburg is west of Manhattan, not south. Therefore, Williamsburg (Brooklyn) is not south of Hillman Houses (Manhattan). 

But the question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which is incorrect because Williamsburg is in Brooklyn. So if the user is asking about a place in Manhattan named Williamsburg, perhaps there's a different location. But I don't think there is. Therefore, the answer would be no, because Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan, and even if it were in Manhattan, its position relative to Hillman Houses would need to be checked. But since the premise is incorrect, the answer is no.
