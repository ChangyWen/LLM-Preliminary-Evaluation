Okay, so I need to figure out whether Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy, died later than William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two historical figures.

First, Agnes of Aquitaine. I think she was a noblewoman from the 12th century. She was the Countess of Savoy, right? I remember that she was the wife of Amadeus III, Count of Savoy. I'm not exactly sure when she died, but maybe I can look up her dates. Wait, I should try to remember. I think she was born around 1122 and died in 1177. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me think if there's any other info. She was involved in some political marriages, maybe to strengthen alliances. 

Then there's William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. He was a medieval English nobleman. I believe he was a companion of William the Conqueror and was rewarded with lands in England after the Norman Conquest. His dates... I think he was born around 1040 and died in 1088. Wait, but I'm not sure. The key here is to compare their death dates. If Agnes died in 1177 and William in 1088, then yes, she died later. But I need to confirm these dates.

Let me try to recall or reconstruct. William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, was a significant figure in the 11th century. He was one of the few Norman barons who survived the reign of William the Conqueror and lived through the reign of William II. He died in 1088, I think. That's a key point. 

Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy, was a 12th-century figure. She was the daughter of Duke William IX of Aquitaine. Her marriage to Amadeus III of Savoy was part of political alliances. She was known for her piety and founded the Cistercian Abbey of Tartare. Her death date is often cited as 1177. So if she died in 1177 and William in 1088, then yes, she died later. 

Wait, but I should make sure there's no confusion with another Agnes of Aquitaine. There was also an Agnes of Aquitaine who was a queen of France, but that's a different person. The Countess of Savoy is the one in question here. 

So, to sum up: William de Warenne died in 1088, Agnes of Aquitaine died in 1177. Therefore, Agnes died later. The answer should be Yes.
