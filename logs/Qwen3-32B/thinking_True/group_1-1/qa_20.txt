Okay, so I need to figure out if Lake Verret in Louisiana is located south of Calcasieu Lake, also in Louisiana. Let me start by recalling what I know about these lakes. 

First, I know that Louisiana has a lot of lakes, especially in the southern part of the state. Calcasieu Lake is one of them. I think Calcasieu Lake is in the southwest part of Louisiana, maybe near the Gulf of Mexico. I remember that there's a Calcasieu Parish, so maybe the lake is there. 

Now, Lake Verret... I'm not as familiar with that name. Maybe it's a smaller lake or a bayou? I think I've heard of Lake Verret in the context of the Atchafalaya Basin, which is a large wetland area in Louisiana. The Atchafalaya River flows through there, and there are several lakes and bayous in that region. 

So, if Calcasieu Lake is in the southwest, and Lake Verret is in the Atchafalaya Basin, which is more central or maybe in the southeast part of Louisiana, then maybe Lake Verret is south of Calcasieu Lake. But I need to verify the exact locations.

Let me try to visualize a map of Louisiana. The Atchafalaya Basin is between Baton Rouge and New Iberia, I think. Calcasieu Parish is further west, near Lake Charles. So if Calcasieu Lake is near Lake Charles, and Lake Verret is in the Atchafalaya area, then Lake Verret would be east of Calcasieu Lake, not necessarily south. Wait, but maybe the Atchafalaya Basin is south of Calcasieu Lake? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe I should look up the approximate coordinates of both lakes. Let me try to recall or think of other references. Calcasieu Lake is part of the Calcasieu River system, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The Atchafalaya River flows into the Gulf as well, but it's a different system. 

If I consider the Atchafalaya Basin, which is a large area, Lake Verret is one of the lakes within that basin. The Atchafalaya Basin is located in the central to southern part of Louisiana, stretching from the Red River to the Gulf. So if Calcasieu Lake is in the southwest, then the Atchafalaya Basin is more to the east and south of Calcasieu Lake. Therefore, Lake Verret, being part of the Atchafalaya Basin, would be south of Calcasieu Lake. 

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check the latitudes. Let's say Calcasieu Lake is around 30°N latitude. The Atchafalaya Basin is around 30°N as well, but maybe a bit further south. For example, Lake Verret is near the town of Lake Verret, which I think is in St. Mary Parish. St. Mary Parish is in the southern part of Louisiana, closer to the Gulf. Calcasieu Parish is in the southwest, so if Lake Verret is in the south, then yes, it would be south of Calcasieu Lake. 

Alternatively, if I think of the major cities: Lake Charles is in Calcasieu Parish, and New Iberia is in St. Mary Parish. New Iberia is south of Lake Charles, so if Lake Verret is near New Iberia, then it's south of Calcasieu Lake. 

I think that's the case. So the answer would be yes, Lake Verret is south of Calcasieu Lake in Louisiana.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify Locations:**
   - **Calcasieu Lake** is located in **Calcasieu Parish**, Louisiana, near the city of Lake Charles in the **southwest** part of the state.
   - **Lake Verret** is part of the **Atchafalaya Basin**, situated in **St. Mary Parish**, Louisiana, near the town of Lake Verret in the **southern-central** part of the state.

2. **Geographic Context:**
   - Calcasieu Lake lies in the **southwest**, closer to the Gulf of Mexico but west of the Atchafalaya River system.
   - Lake Verret is in the **Atchafalaya Basin**, which extends from the Red River to the Gulf of Mexico, placing it **east and south** of Calcasieu Lake.

3. **Relative Positioning:**
   - Major cities for reference: **Lake Charles** (Calcasieu Parish) is in the **southwest**, while **New Iberia** (near Lake Verret) is in the **southern-central** region.
   - New Iberia is **south of Lake Charles**, confirming that Lake Verret is **south of Calcasieu Lake**.

**Final Answer:**  
Yes.
