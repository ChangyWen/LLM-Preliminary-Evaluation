Okay, so I need to figure out if The Ort Institute in Illinois is located west of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan in Wisconsin. Let me start by recalling the locations of these places.

First, I know that Illinois and Wisconsin are both U.S. states. Illinois is to the east of Wisconsin. Wait, no, actually, looking at a map, Wisconsin is to the east of Illinois. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The Mississippi River runs along the western border of Illinois and the eastern border of Wisconsin. So Illinois is west of Wisconsin. So if a place is in Illinois, it's generally west of a place in Wisconsin. But I need to check the specific cities where these institutions are located.

The Ort Institute is in Illinois. I'm not exactly sure which city, but maybe it's in Chicago? Or another city. Let me check. Wait, I can't look it up, so I have to rely on my existing knowledge. The University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Sheboygan is a city in eastern Wisconsin, near the Lake Michigan coast. So Sheboygan is in the eastern part of Wisconsin.

Now, if The Ort Institute is in Illinois, and Illinois is west of Wisconsin, then any location in Illinois would be west of any location in Wisconsin. But wait, that's not entirely accurate because the states are adjacent along their borders. For example, a city in the westernmost part of Wisconsin (like La Crosse) is near the Illinois border. But Sheboygan is in eastern Wisconsin, so it's further east. Therefore, even if The Ort Institute is in the eastern part of Illinois, it would still be west of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, since Illinois is west of Wisconsin overall.

But maybe I should consider specific cities. Let me think. If The Ort Institute is in Chicago, which is in northeastern Illinois, then Chicago is west of Sheboygan? Wait, no. Sheboygan is in eastern Wisconsin, and Chicago is in northeastern Illinois. But since Illinois is west of Wisconsin, Chicago would be west of Sheboygan. Because if you imagine the map, Wisconsin is east of Illinois. So a city in Illinois, even in the northeast corner, would be west of a city in eastern Wisconsin. So yes, The Ort Institute in Illinois would be west of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan in Wisconsin.

Wait, but I need to confirm the exact locations. Let me try to visualize the map. Sheboygan is on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, in the eastern part of Wisconsin. The Ort Institute in Illinois—if it's in Chicago, which is on the western shore of Lake Michigan, then Chicago is directly west of Sheboygan across the lake. So yes, that would make The Ort Institute in Chicago west of Sheboygan. If The Ort Institute is in another city in Illinois, like Springfield or Peoria, those are further south but still west of Sheboygan. So regardless of where in Illinois the institute is, it's west of Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Understand the States' Positions:**
   - Illinois is located west of Wisconsin. The Mississippi River forms part of their shared border, with Illinois to the west and Wisconsin to the east.

2. **Identify Specific Locations:**

   - The Ort Institute is in Illinois. While the exact city isn't specified, Illinois as a whole is west of Wisconsin.

3. **Geographic Comparison:**
   - Even if The Ort Institute is in a city like Chicago (northeastern Illinois) or Springfield (central Illinois), it would still be west of Sheboygan, Wisconsin. This is because Illinois lies entirely west of Wisconsin, and Sheboygan is in the easternmost part of Wisconsin.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since Illinois is west of Wisconsin and Sheboygan is in eastern Wisconsin, any location in Illinois (including The Ort Institute) is west of Sheboygan.
