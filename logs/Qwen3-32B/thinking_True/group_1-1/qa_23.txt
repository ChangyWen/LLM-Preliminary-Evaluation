Okay, so I need to figure out if Pine Flat Dam in California is located east of St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church in Nevada. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

First, I should confirm the exact locations of both places. Pine Flat Dam is in California, but I'm not exactly sure where. I know California has several dams, and Pine Flat Dam might be in the Sierra Nevada region. Maybe it's near a town like Clovis or somewhere in the Central Valley? I think the Sierra Nevada mountains run through California, so if the dam is in that area, it might be east of the central part of the state.

Now, St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church in Nevada. Nevada is east of California, so if the church is in Nevada, it's already east of California. But wait, the question is whether Pine Flat Dam is east of the church. So I need to compare their positions. Let me think: if the church is in Nevada, which is east of California, but depending on where in Nevada the church is, the dam's location in California could be east or west relative to it.

Wait, maybe I should get the coordinates of both places. Let me try to recall or figure out their approximate locations. Pine Flat Dam is in Fresno County, California. Fresno is in the central part of California, near the Sierra Nevada foothills. So the dam is probably east of the central valley, near the mountains. 

St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church—I'm not sure where in Nevada that is. Nevada is a large state, but if it's a church in the mountains, maybe it's in the eastern part of Nevada, near the Sierra Nevada range? Or perhaps in the Spring Mountains or another range. Alternatively, maybe it's in a town like Carson City or near Lake Tahoe. Let me think: Lake Tahoe is on the California-Nevada border, so if the church is near there, it's in Nevada's part of the Sierra Nevada. 

If Pine Flat Dam is in Fresno County, California, and the church is in Nevada near the Sierra Nevada, then depending on their exact positions, the dam could be east or west. Wait, but California's Sierra Nevada is on the east side of the state. So if Pine Flat Dam is in the Sierra foothills in California, it's east of the central part of California. But Nevada is east of California. So if the church is in Nevada, which is east of California, then the dam in California would be west of Nevada. But the question is whether the dam is east of the church. 

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up directions. Let me visualize a map. California is west of Nevada. So if you're in California, east would be towards Nevada. So if Pine Flat Dam is in California, east of the central part, and the church is in Nevada, then the dam is west of the church. Therefore, the answer would be no. But I need to confirm the exact locations.

Let me check the coordinates. Pine Flat Dam is located at approximately 36.77° N, 119.43° W. St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church—I need to find its location. Let me think. If it's in Nevada, maybe in the town of St. Mary's? Wait, there's a St. Mary's in Nevada, part of the Humboldt River area. Let me check coordinates for that. St. Mary's, Nevada is around 39.63° N, 115.95° W. 

Comparing the longitudes: Pine Flat Dam is at 119.43° W, and St. Mary's, NV is at 115.95° W. Since lower longitude numbers mean further east (because longitude decreases as you go east), 115.95 is east of 119.43. Therefore, Pine Flat Dam (119.43° W) is west of St. Mary's, NV (115.95° W). Therefore, the answer is no, Pine Flat Dam is not east of St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church in Nevada. 

Wait, but I need to make sure that the church in question is indeed in St. Mary's, NV. The user mentioned "Mountains Catholic Church, NV"—maybe it's a different location. Let me confirm. If the church is in the mountains of Nevada, perhaps near the Sierra Nevada, like near Lake Tahoe. For example, if it's in Incline Village or South Lake Tahoe, which are in Nevada, their coordinates would be around 39.0° N, 120.0° W. Wait, but that's actually in California. Wait, no, Lake Tahoe is on the border. South Lake Tahoe is in California, and Incline Village is in Nevada. So Incline Village is around 39.0° N, 120.0° W. But that's in Nevada. If the church is there, then the longitude would be 120.0° W. Pine Flat Dam is at 119.43° W, which is east of 120.0° W. So in that case, Pine Flat Dam would be east of Incline Village, NV. But the user's question is about St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church in NV. If that church is in Incline Village, then the answer would be yes. But if it's in St. Mary's, NV (the town), which is at 115.95° W, then the answer is no. 

So the key is to determine where exactly the church is located. The name "St. Mary's in the Mountains" might refer to a specific location. Let me check if there's a St. Mary's Catholic Church in the mountains of Nevada. A quick search in my mind: St. Mary's in the Mountains is a church located in the town of St. Mary's, Nevada, which is in Lyon County. The coordinates for St. Mary's, NV are approximately 39.63° N, 115.95° W. So if that's the case, then Pine Flat Dam (119.43° W) is west of St. Mary's, NV (115.95° W). Therefore, the answer is no. 

But wait, another possibility: if the church is in a different mountainous area of Nevada, like near the Sierra Nevada in the east, but that's actually in California. Wait, the Sierra Nevada range is in California, with the eastern part near the Nevada border. So if the church is in Nevada near the Sierra Nevada, it would be in the eastern part of Nevada, but the longitude would still be higher (more west) than St. Mary's, NV. For example, if it's in Elko, NV, which is around 115.6° W, then Pine Flat Dam is at 119.43° W, which is west of Elko. So again, the answer would be no. 

Therefore, unless the church is in a very western part of Nevada, which is near the California border, but even then, the longitude would be around 119.0° W. For example, if the church is in a town like Fernley, NV, which is around 119.5° W, then Pine Flat Dam at 119.43° W would be slightly east of Fernley. But I don't think St. Mary's in the Mountains is in Fernley. 

Given that St. Mary's, NV is a real town with the church, and its coordinates are 115.95° W, then Pine Flat Dam is west of it. Therefore, the answer is no.
