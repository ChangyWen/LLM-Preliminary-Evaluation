**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether the article **"Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal."** was published earlier than **"Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained."**, we would need to know the **publication dates** of both articles.

Since you haven't provided specific dates or sources, I can't definitively compare them. However, I can offer the following guidance:

- If both articles are from the **same news outlet** (e.g., *The New York Times*, *The Guardian*, etc.), you can check the **archive** of that outlet to find the exact publication dates.
- If they are from **different outlets**, you may need to search for each article on a news aggregator or search engine and look at the **publication date** listed.

If you can provide the **publication dates** or the **sources** of the articles, I can help you compare them directly.
