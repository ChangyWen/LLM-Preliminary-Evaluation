**************************************** Content ***************************************
The **Sangre de Cristo Range** in Colorado is **not located east of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains** in Colorado — in fact, they are the **same thing**.

The **Sangre de Cristo Range** is a mountain range in southern Colorado, and it is part of the larger **Rocky Mountains**. The name "Sangre de Cristo" (Spanish for "Blood of Christ") refers to the red color of the rocks, which is due to iron oxide.

So, to clarify:

- The **Sangre de Cristo Range** and the **Sangre de Cristo Mountains** are **not two separate entities**.
- They are **one and the same** geographic feature.
- Therefore, the Sangre de Cristo Range is **not located east of** the Sangre de Cristo Mountains — they are the **same range**.

If you're referring to a different range or location with a similar name, please provide more context, and I can help clarify further.
