Let's break down this question step-by-step to determine if the boiling point of water is lower than the melting point of ice.

**Step 1: Define the terms and their standard values.**

*   **Boiling Point of Water:** This is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a gas (steam) at standard atmospheric pressure.
    *   Standard value: **100°C (or 212°F)**

*   **Melting Point of Ice:** This is the temperature at which ice changes from a solid to a liquid (water) at standard atmospheric pressure.
    *   Standard value: **0°C (or 32°F)**

**Step 2: Compare the two standard values.**

*   Boiling Point of Water = 100°C
*   Melting Point of Ice = 0°C

**Step 3: Determine if the boiling point is lower than the melting point.**

*   Is 100°C lower than 0°C?
*   No, 100°C is significantly higher than 0°C.

**Step 4: Formulate the final answer.**

Based on the comparison, the boiling point of water (100°C) is much higher than the melting point of ice (0°C).

**Final Answer:** No
