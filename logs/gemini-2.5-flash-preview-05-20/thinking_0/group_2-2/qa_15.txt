Let's break down the comparison between the speed of sound and the speed of light.

**Understanding the Concepts:**

*   **Speed of Sound:** Sound travels as vibrations through a medium (like air, water, or solids). Its speed depends on the properties of that medium (temperature, density, elasticity).
*   **Speed of Light:** Light is an electromagnetic wave. It can travel through a vacuum and various media. Its speed in a vacuum is a fundamental physical constant.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Typical Speed of Sound in Air:**
    *   At sea level and 20°C (68°F), the speed of sound in dry air is approximately **343 meters per second (m/s)**.
    *   To put this in more familiar terms, that's about 767 miles per hour (mph) or 1,235 kilometers per hour (km/h).

2.  **Speed of Light in a Vacuum:**
    *   The speed of light in a vacuum, denoted by 'c', is exactly **299,792,458 meters per second (m/s)**.
    *   To put this in more familiar terms, that's about 186,282 miles per second or 1,079,252,848.8 kilometers per hour.

3.  **Direct Comparison:**
    *   Compare the two values:
        *   Speed of Sound (approx.): 343 m/s
        *   Speed of Light (exact): 299,792,458 m/s

4.  **Magnitude Difference:**
    *   It's immediately clear that 299,792,458 is vastly larger than 343.
    *   The speed of light is roughly **874,000 times faster** than the speed of sound in air.

5.  **Consideration of Mediums:**
    *   While the speed of sound can vary (it's faster in water and even faster in solids like steel), it *never* approaches the speed of light.
    *   The speed of light *does* slow down when it passes through a medium (like water or glass), but even then, it's still orders of magnitude faster than the speed of sound in any medium. For example, light in water is still about 225,000,000 m/s, which is still vastly faster than sound in water (around 1,500 m/s).

**Final Answer:**

No. The speed of sound is significantly slower than the speed of light.
