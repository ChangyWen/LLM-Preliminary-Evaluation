Let's break down the reasoning process to determine if the atomic number of carbon is higher than that of oxygen.

**Step 1: Understand "Atomic Number"**
The atomic number of an element is defined by the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element. This number is unique to each element and determines its position on the periodic table.

**Step 2: Locate Carbon on the Periodic Table**
Find carbon (C) on the periodic table. You'll see that its atomic number is 6. This means a carbon atom has 6 protons.

**Step 3: Locate Oxygen on the Periodic Table**
Find oxygen (O) on the periodic table. You'll see that its atomic number is 8. This means an oxygen atom has 8 protons.

**Step 4: Compare the Atomic Numbers**
* Carbon's atomic number = 6
* Oxygen's atomic number = 8

Comparing 6 and 8, we can clearly see that 6 is less than 8.

**Step 5: Formulate the Answer**
The question asks if the atomic number of carbon is *higher* than that of oxygen. Since 6 is not higher than 8, the answer is no.

**Final Answer:** No
