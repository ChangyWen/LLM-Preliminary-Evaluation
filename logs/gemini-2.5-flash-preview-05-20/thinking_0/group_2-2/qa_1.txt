Let's break down the comparison between an elephant and a blue whale.

**Step 1: Understand the Organisms**

*   **Elephant:** A large land mammal, the largest land animal.
*   **Blue Whale:** A marine mammal, the largest animal on Earth (both currently and arguably in history).

**Step 2: Research Typical Weights**

*   **Elephant (African Bush Elephant, the largest species):**
    *   Adult males typically weigh between 4,000 kg and 6,000 kg (4 to 6 metric tons).
    *   Some exceptionally large individuals can reach up to 7,000 kg (7 metric tons).
*   **Blue Whale:**
    *   Adult blue whales typically weigh between 100,000 kg and 200,000 kg (100 to 200 metric tons).
    *   Some very large individuals have been recorded at over 180,000 kg (180 metric tons).

**Step 3: Compare the Weight Ranges**

*   Elephant max weight (approx.): 7,000 kg
*   Blue Whale min weight (approx.): 100,000 kg

**Step 4: Draw a Conclusion**

Even the smallest adult blue whale is significantly heavier than the largest adult elephant. The blue whale's weight range starts where the elephant's ends, and then goes vastly higher.

**Final Answer:**

No.
