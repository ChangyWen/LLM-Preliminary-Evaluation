Let's break down the reasoning process to determine if blue light has a longer wavelength than red light.

**Step 1: Understand the Electromagnetic Spectrum**

The electromagnetic spectrum is a continuous range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. Visible light is a small portion of this spectrum. Within the visible light spectrum, different colors correspond to different wavelengths and frequencies.

**Step 2: Relate Color to Energy and Frequency**

*   **Energy and Frequency:** The energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency. This relationship is described by Planck's equation: $E = hf$, where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, and f is frequency.
*   **Visible Light Colors:**
    *   **Red light** is at the lower energy end of the visible spectrum.
    *   **Blue/Violet light** is at the higher energy end of the visible spectrum.
    *   Therefore, blue light has a higher frequency than red light.

**Step 3: Relate Wavelength to Frequency (and Speed of Light)**

*   The speed of light (c) in a vacuum is constant.
*   The relationship between speed, wavelength ($\lambda$), and frequency (f) is given by the equation: $c = \lambda f$.
*   From this equation, we can derive: $\lambda = c/f$.

**Step 4: Apply the Relationship to Blue and Red Light**

*   We established that blue light has a *higher frequency* ($f_{blue}$) than red light ($f_{red}$). So, $f_{blue} > f_{red}$.
*   Using the equation $\lambda = c/f$:
    *   For blue light: $\lambda_{blue} = c / f_{blue}$
    *   For red light: $\lambda_{red} = c / f_{red}$

*   Since 'c' is constant, if the frequency (f) is *higher*, the wavelength ($\lambda$) must be *shorter* to maintain the constant speed of light. Conversely, if the frequency (f) is *lower*, the wavelength ($\lambda$) must be *longer*.

*   Because $f_{blue} > f_{red}$, it follows that $\lambda_{blue} < \lambda_{red}$.

**Step 5: Formulate the Final Answer**

Based on the reasoning, the wavelength of blue light is *shorter* than that of red light.

**Final Answer:**

No
