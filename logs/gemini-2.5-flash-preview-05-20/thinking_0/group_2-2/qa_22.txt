Let's break down the reasoning process to determine if Canada is located south of Brazil.

**Step 1: Understand the Question**
The question asks for a directional relationship: "Is Canada located south of Brazil?"

**Step 2: Recall Basic Geography/World Map Knowledge**

*   **Canada:** Where is Canada generally located on a world map? It's in North America, specifically the northern part of North America.
*   **Brazil:** Where is Brazil generally located on a world map? It's in South America, specifically a large country in the eastern part of South America.

**Step 3: Visualize Relative Positions**

Imagine a simplified world map or globe:

*   The Equator is an imaginary line that circles the Earth horizontally, dividing it into the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere.
*   North America is almost entirely in the Northern Hemisphere.
*   South America is almost entirely in the Southern Hemisphere.

**Step 4: Determine Hemispheres**

*   **Canada:** Clearly in the Northern Hemisphere. Its latitude is high positive (e.g., 49째N to 83째N).
*   **Brazil:** Primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, though a small northern part crosses the Equator into the Northern Hemisphere. Its main bulk and capital are south of the Equator (e.g., 5째N to 34째S).

**Step 5: Compare Latitudes/Hemispheres**

*   If a country is "south of" another, it means its latitude values are *lower* (closer to the South Pole or further from the North Pole) than the other country.
*   Canada is in the *Northern* Hemisphere.
*   Brazil is predominantly in the *Southern* Hemisphere.

**Step 6: Conclude the Directional Relationship**

Since Canada is in the Northern Hemisphere and Brazil is predominantly in the Southern Hemisphere, Canada is *north* of Brazil. Therefore, it cannot be south of Brazil.

**Final Answer:**

No
