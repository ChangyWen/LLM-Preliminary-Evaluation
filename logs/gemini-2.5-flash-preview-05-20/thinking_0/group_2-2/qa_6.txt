Let's break down the comparison between the Yangtze River and the Nile River to determine which is longer.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the Length of the Yangtze River:**
    *   The Yangtze River is primarily located in China.
    *   According to most geographical and hydrological sources, the length of the Yangtze River is approximately **6,300 kilometers (3,915 miles)**.

2.  **Identify the Length of the Nile River:**
    *   The Nile River flows through northeastern Africa.
    *   According to most geographical and hydrological sources, the length of the Nile River is approximately **6,650 kilometers (4,132 miles)**.

3.  **Compare the Lengths:**
    *   Yangtze River length: 6,300 km
    *   Nile River length: 6,650 km

    *   Comparing these two figures: 6,650 km is greater than 6,300 km.

4.  **Formulate the Conclusion:**
    *   Since 6,650 km (Nile) is longer than 6,300 km (Yangtze), the Nile River is longer than the Yangtze River.

**Final Answer:**

No
