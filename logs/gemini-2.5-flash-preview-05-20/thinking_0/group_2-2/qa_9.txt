Let's break down the comparison of temperatures in the Arctic and Antarctica step-by-step.

**Step 1: Understand the Basic Geography and Land/Ocean Distribution**

*   **Arctic:** Primarily an ocean (Arctic Ocean) surrounded by landmasses (North America, Europe, Asia).
*   **Antarctica:** A continent (landmass) surrounded by an ocean (Southern Ocean).

**Step 2: Consider the Thermal Properties of Land vs. Water**

*   **Water:** Has a high specific heat capacity. This means it takes a lot of energy to heat up and a lot of energy to cool down. It acts as a temperature buffer, moderating extremes.
*   **Land:** Has a lower specific heat capacity. It heats up and cools down more quickly and to greater extremes.

**Step 3: Apply Thermal Properties to Each Pole**

*   **Arctic:**
    *   The presence of a large ocean (Arctic Ocean) means that even though it's covered in ice, the underlying water moderates the temperature. The ocean acts as a heat sink in summer (absorbing heat) and releases some of that heat in winter (preventing temperatures from plummeting as low as they would over land).
    *   Ocean currents can also bring some warmer water into the Arctic basin.
    *   The surrounding landmasses also experience seasonal temperature variations, but the central Arctic Ocean is buffered.

*   **Antarctica:**
    *   Being a continent, Antarctica is essentially a massive landmass covered by an incredibly thick ice sheet (up to 4.8 km thick).
    *   Land loses heat much more efficiently to space than water does.
    *   The high elevation of the Antarctic plateau (average elevation around 2,500 meters, making it the highest continent) also contributes to colder temperatures, as temperature generally decreases with altitude.
    *   The continent is isolated by the circumpolar current, which limits the influx of warmer ocean water.

**Step 4: Consider Elevation**

*   **Arctic:** Mostly sea level (ocean).
*   **Antarctica:** High average elevation (highest continent). Higher elevation generally means colder temperatures.

**Step 5: Consider Isolation and Ocean Currents**

*   **Arctic:** Less isolated, with some ocean currents bringing warmer water.
*   **Antarctica:** Very isolated by the strong Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which acts as a thermal barrier, preventing warmer waters from reaching the continent.

**Step 6: Synthesize the Factors**

The combination of Antarctica being a high-altitude landmass that loses heat efficiently to space, its isolation from warmer ocean currents, and the moderating effect of the ocean in the Arctic leads to a significant temperature difference.

**Step 7: Compare Average Temperatures**

*   **Arctic (winter average):** Around -34°C (-30°F)
*   **Antarctica (winter average):** Around -49°C (-56°F)
    *   The lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth was at Vostok Station in Antarctica: -89.2°C (-128.6°F). No comparable temperatures have been recorded in the Arctic.

**Final Answer:**

No.

**Reasoning Summary:**

Antarctica is significantly colder than the Arctic. This is primarily because Antarctica is a high-altitude continent (landmass) that loses heat very efficiently to space, while the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land. The ocean in the Arctic acts as a temperature buffer, moderating the extreme cold, whereas the vast landmass of Antarctica, isolated by ocean currents, allows for much lower temperatures.
