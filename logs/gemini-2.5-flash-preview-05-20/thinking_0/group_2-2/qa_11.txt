Let's break down the comparison of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand the Question:** The question asks if the Atlantic Ocean is *larger* than the Pacific Ocean. This implies a comparison of their surface area.

2.  **Recall General Geographic Knowledge:** From basic geography, the Pacific Ocean is consistently referred to as the largest and deepest ocean on Earth. The Atlantic Ocean is generally known as the second largest.

3.  **Consult Reliable Sources (if unsure or for verification):** If there's any doubt, or to provide precise figures, one would typically consult geographical encyclopedias, scientific databases (like NOAA, National Geographic, CIA World Factbook), or reputable educational websites.

    *   **Pacific Ocean Area:** Approximately 165.25 million square kilometers (63.8 million square miles). It covers about one-third of the surface area of the Earth and is larger than all of Earth's landmass combined.
    *   **Atlantic Ocean Area:** Approximately 106.46 million square kilometers (41.1 million square miles).

4.  **Compare the Figures:**
    *   Pacific Ocean: ~165.25 million sq km
    *   Atlantic Ocean: ~106.46 million sq km

    Clearly, 165.25 million is greater than 106.46 million.

5.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Based on the comparison, the Pacific Ocean is significantly larger than the Atlantic Ocean. Therefore, the statement "Is the Atlantic Ocean larger than the Pacific Ocean?" is false.

**Final Answer:**

No
