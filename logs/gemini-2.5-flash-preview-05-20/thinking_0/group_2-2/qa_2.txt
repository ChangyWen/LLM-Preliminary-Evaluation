Let's break down the comparison between K2 and Mount Everest.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the Mountains:** We are comparing K2 (also known as Mount Godwin Austen) and Mount Everest.

2.  **Recall/Research Heights:**
    *   **Mount Everest:** The generally accepted height is 8,848.86 meters (or approximately 29,031.7 feet) above sea level. It is the highest mountain in the world.
    *   **K2:** The generally accepted height is 8,611 meters (or approximately 28,251 feet) above sea level. It is the second-highest mountain in the world.

3.  **Compare the Heights:**
    *   8,848.86 meters (Everest) vs. 8,611 meters (K2)

4.  **Determine Greater Value:** 8,848.86 is greater than 8,611.

5.  **Formulate Conclusion:** Since Mount Everest's height is greater than K2's height, K2 is *not* taller than Mount Everest.

**Final Answer:**

No
