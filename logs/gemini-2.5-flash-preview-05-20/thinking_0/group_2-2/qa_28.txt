Let's break down the comparison between an eagle and a peregrine falcon in terms of speed.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the Key Characteristic:** The question is specifically about "speed."

2.  **Consider the Peregrine Falcon's Reputation:** The peregrine falcon is widely known and scientifically documented as the fastest animal on Earth, particularly in its hunting dive (stoop). This is a well-established fact in ornithology and general knowledge.

3.  **Consider the Eagle's Reputation:** Eagles are known for their powerful flight, impressive wingspan, and ability to soar for long periods. They are fast, but their primary hunting strategy often involves powerful dives or sustained pursuit, not necessarily the extreme high-speed stoop of a peregrine.

4.  **Compare Flight Styles/Hunting Strategies:**
    *   **Peregrine Falcon:** Specializes in high-altitude dives (stoops) where gravity assists in reaching incredible speeds (over 200 mph or 320 km/h). Their body shape is highly aerodynamic for this purpose.
    *   **Eagle:** While capable of fast flight and dives, their typical hunting speeds are lower. For example, a Golden Eagle might reach speeds of 150-200 mph in a dive, but this is still generally less than the top speeds recorded for peregrines. Their sustained level flight speed is also impressive but not as fast as a peregrine's stoop.

5.  **Focus on "Faster":** The question asks who is "faster," implying top speed capability.

6.  **Conclusion based on evidence:** The peregrine falcon's specialized hunting dive allows it to achieve speeds significantly higher than any eagle species.

**Final Answer:**

No
