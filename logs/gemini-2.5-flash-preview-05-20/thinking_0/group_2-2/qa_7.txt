Let's break down the comparison between a lion and a cheetah's speed.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the Primary Characteristic of Each Animal Related to Speed:**
    *   **Cheetah:** Widely known and scientifically recognized as the fastest land animal. Its body is specifically adapted for short, explosive bursts of speed.
    *   **Lion:** A powerful predator, but its hunting strategy relies more on strength, ambush, and short charges rather than sustained high-speed pursuit. While fast, it's not built for the same level of acceleration and top speed as a cheetah.

2.  **Consider Physical Adaptations for Speed:**
    *   **Cheetah:**
        *   **Flexible Spine:** Allows for extreme stretching and contraction, increasing stride length.
        *   **Long, Muscular Legs:** Designed for powerful propulsion.
        *   **Non-Retractable Claws:** Provide excellent grip like running spikes.
        *   **Large Nostrils and Lungs:** For maximum oxygen intake during sprints.
        *   **Long Tail:** Acts as a counterbalance for steering during high-speed turns.
    *   **Lion:**
        *   **Muscular Build:** Primarily for strength, pouncing, and bringing down large prey.
        *   **Less Flexible Spine:** Compared to a cheetah, it's more rigid for power.
        *   **Retractable Claws:** Good for gripping prey, but not optimized for sustained high-speed traction like a cheetah's.
        *   **Heavier Body Mass:** While contributing to power, it's a disadvantage for top-end speed compared to a lighter, more agile cheetah.

3.  **Compare Typical Top Speeds (Approximate):**
    *   **Cheetah:** Can reach speeds of up to 70-75 mph (112-120 km/h) over short distances.
    *   **Lion:** Can reach speeds of up to 50 mph (80 km/h) over short distances.

4.  **Consider Hunting Strategies:**
    *   **Cheetah:** Relies on pure speed to outrun prey in open grasslands.
    *   **Lion:** Often hunts in prides, using teamwork, stalking, and short, powerful charges to ambush prey. While they can run fast, their strategy doesn't demand the extreme top speed of a cheetah.

5.  **Conclusion Based on Evidence:** All evidence points to the cheetah being significantly faster than the lion.

**Final Answer:**

No
