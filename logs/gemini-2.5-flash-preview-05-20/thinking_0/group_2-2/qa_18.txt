Let's break this down step-by-step to determine if the distance from Earth to the Moon is greater than the distance from Earth to the Sun.

**Step 1: Identify the key distances we need to compare.**
*   Distance from Earth to the Moon (Lunar Distance)
*   Distance from Earth to the Sun (Astronomical Unit)

**Step 2: Find the approximate values for these distances.**

*   **Earth to Moon Distance:** This distance varies slightly due to the Moon's elliptical orbit, but we can use an average.
    *   Average distance from Earth to the Moon $\approx 384,400$ kilometers (km)
    *   In miles, this is $\approx 238,900$ miles

*   **Earth to Sun Distance:** This distance also varies slightly throughout the year due to Earth's elliptical orbit, but we use an average value known as an Astronomical Unit (AU).
    *   Average distance from Earth to the Sun $\approx 149.6$ million kilometers (km)
    *   This can be written as $149,600,000$ km
    *   In miles, this is $\approx 93$ million miles ($93,000,000$ miles)

**Step 3: Compare the two values.**

*   Earth to Moon: $\approx 384,400$ km
*   Earth to Sun: $\approx 149,600,000$ km

Clearly, $149,600,000$ is a much larger number than $384,400$.

**Step 4: Formulate the conclusion.**

The distance from Earth to the Sun is vastly greater than the distance from Earth to the Moon. To put it in perspective, the Sun is roughly 390 times farther away from Earth than the Moon is.

**Final Answer:**

No.
