Let's break down the pH of water and lemon juice step-by-step.

**Understanding pH:**

*   **pH scale:** The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14.
*   **Acidity:** A pH below 7 indicates acidity. The lower the number, the more acidic.
*   **Neutrality:** A pH of 7 indicates neutrality.
*   **Alkalinity (Basicity):** A pH above 7 indicates alkalinity or basicity. The higher the number, the more alkaline.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1.  **Pure Water:** Pure water (H₂O) is considered a neutral substance. At 25°C, the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻) are equal, resulting in a pH of **7.0**.

2.  **Lemon Juice:** Lemons are citrus fruits, and their juice contains citric acid, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), and other organic acids. These acids release hydrogen ions (H⁺) into the solution.

3.  **Effect of Acids on pH:** When acids are present in a solution, they increase the concentration of H⁺ ions. According to the pH formula (pH = -log[H⁺]), an increase in [H⁺] leads to a *decrease* in the pH value.

4.  **Typical pH of Lemon Juice:** Due to the presence of these acids, lemon juice is highly acidic. Its typical pH range is between **2.0 and 2.5**.

5.  **Comparison:**
    *   pH of pure water = 7.0
    *   pH of lemon juice = 2.0 - 2.5

    Comparing these values, 2.0-2.5 is significantly lower than 7.0.

**Final Answer:**

No.
