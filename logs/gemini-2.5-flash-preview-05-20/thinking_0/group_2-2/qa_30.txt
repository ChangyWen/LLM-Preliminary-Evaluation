Let's break down the reasoning process to determine if the average lifespan of a dog is longer than that of a human.

**Step 1: Identify the average lifespan for each species.**

*   **Humans:** According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and various national health statistics, the global average human lifespan is currently around **73-74 years**. In developed countries, it's often higher, reaching into the late 70s or early 80s.
*   **Dogs:** The average lifespan for dogs varies significantly by breed, size, and individual health, but generally ranges from **10 to 13 years**. Smaller breeds tend to live longer than larger breeds.

**Step 2: Compare the two average lifespans.**

*   Human average lifespan: ~73-74 years
*   Dog average lifespan: ~10-13 years

**Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison.**

73-74 years is significantly greater than 10-13 years.

**Final Answer:**

No
