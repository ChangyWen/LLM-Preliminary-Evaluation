Let's break down the comparison between the Gobi Desert and the Sahara Desert in terms of temperature.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify Key Characteristics of Each Desert:**

    *   **Sahara Desert:**
        *   Location: North Africa, straddling the Tropic of Cancer.
        *   Climate Type: Subtropical hot desert (Köppen classification: BWh).
        *   Dominant Features: Vast sand dunes (ergs), rocky plateaus (hamadas), gravel plains (regs).
        *   Temperature Extremes: Known for extremely high daytime temperatures, especially in summer. Record high temperatures on Earth have been recorded here. Winters are generally mild to warm.
        *   Precipitation: Very low, often less than 100 mm per year.

    *   **Gobi Desert:**
        *   Location: Central Asia, primarily in Mongolia and China.
        *   Climate Type: Cold desert (Köppen classification: BWk). It's a rain shadow desert, formed by the Himalayas blocking moisture from the Indian Ocean.
        *   Dominant Features: Rocky terrain, gravel plains, salt pans, some sand dunes.
        *   Temperature Extremes: Characterized by *extreme* temperature swings between seasons. Summers can be hot, but not typically as scorching as the Sahara. Winters are *extremely* cold, with temperatures often dropping well below freezing.
        *   Precipitation: Low, but slightly more than the Sahara in some areas, often falling as snow in winter.

2.  **Compare Temperature Regimes:**

    *   **Summer:** The Sahara consistently experiences higher average and peak summer temperatures than the Gobi. The Gobi can be hot in summer, but the Sahara's heat is more intense and prolonged.
    *   **Winter:** This is where the significant difference lies. The Gobi experiences brutally cold winters, with widespread freezing temperatures and snow. The Sahara, while it can get cool at night in winter, rarely experiences widespread freezing temperatures.
    *   **Annual Average:** Due to its extremely cold winters, the Gobi's *average annual temperature* is significantly lower than the Sahara's.

3.  **Consider the Definition of "Hotter":**

    *   If "hotter" refers to the *highest peak temperatures ever recorded* or the *average summer daytime temperatures*, the Sahara is generally hotter.
    *   If "hotter" refers to the *overall annual warmth* or the *lack of extreme cold*, the Sahara is also hotter.

4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**

    The Sahara Desert is known for its consistently high temperatures, especially in summer, and its lack of extreme cold. The Gobi Desert, while it can be warm in summer, is defined by its *extreme* seasonal temperature variations, particularly its very cold winters. Therefore, in terms of overall warmth and peak heat, the Sahara is the hotter desert.

**Final Answer:**

No
