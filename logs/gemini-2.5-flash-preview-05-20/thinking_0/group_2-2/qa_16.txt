Let's break down this question step-by-step to determine if the freezing point of water is higher than its boiling point.

**Step 1: Define Freezing Point**
The freezing point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a solid state. For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, this temperature is **0 degrees Celsius (0°C)** or **32 degrees Fahrenheit (32°F)**.

**Step 2: Define Boiling Point**
The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a gaseous state (vaporizes throughout the liquid). For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, this temperature is **100 degrees Celsius (100°C)** or **212 degrees Fahrenheit (212°F)**.

**Step 3: Compare the Temperatures**
Now, let's compare the two values:

*   Freezing Point of Water: 0°C (or 32°F)
*   Boiling Point of Water: 100°C (or 212°F)

When we compare 0°C to 100°C, it's clear that 0 is a smaller number than 100.
Similarly, when we compare 32°F to 212°F, it's clear that 32 is a smaller number than 212.

**Step 4: Conclude**
Since 0°C is less than 100°C (and 32°F is less than 212°F), the freezing point of water is *lower* than its boiling point.

**Final Answer:**

No
