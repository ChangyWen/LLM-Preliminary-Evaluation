Let's break down the timeline of these significant scientific discoveries.

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the discovery of DNA structure:** The double helix structure of DNA was famously elucidated by Watson and Crick (with contributions from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins) in **1953**.

2.  **Identify the discovery of penicillin:** While the antibacterial properties of *Penicillium* mold were observed earlier, the *discovery of penicillin as a therapeutic antibiotic* is generally attributed to Alexander Fleming in **1928**, when he noticed its effect on bacterial cultures. Its development into a usable drug involved Florey and Chain in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

3.  **Compare the dates:**
    *   Penicillin discovery: 1928
    *   DNA structure discovery: 1953

4.  **Determine which came first:** 1928 is earlier than 1953.

**Final Answer:**

No
