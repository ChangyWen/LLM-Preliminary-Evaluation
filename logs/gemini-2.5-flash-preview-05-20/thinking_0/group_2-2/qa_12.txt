Let's break down this question step-by-step to arrive at the correct answer.

**Step 1: Define "British Empire"**
The British Empire, as a distinct political entity, began to form in the late 16th and early 17th centuries with the establishment of overseas colonies and trading posts by England (and later Great Britain). Its peak was in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

**Step 2: Define "Roman Empire"**
The Roman Empire, in its imperial phase, is generally considered to have begun with the reign of Augustus in 27 BCE (though its republican roots go back much further). It lasted until 476 CE in the West and 1453 CE in the East (Byzantine Empire).

**Step 3: Compare the Timelines**
*   **Roman Empire:** Began 27 BCE (or earlier as a Republic, but the "Empire" phase is key here).
*   **British Empire:** Began late 16th century CE (around 1500s CE).

**Step 4: Determine Which Came First**
Comparing the start dates:
*   27 BCE (Roman Empire)
*   1500s CE (British Empire)

The Roman Empire clearly predates the British Empire by over 1,500 years.

**Step 5: Address Potential Misconceptions**
*   **Roman Britain:** While the Romans did conquer and occupy parts of Britain (starting in 43 CE), this was *part* of the Roman Empire, not the British Empire. The people living there were under Roman rule, and the concept of a "British Empire" as a global power originating from Britain did not exist.
*   **Ancient Britons:** There were various Celtic tribes in Britain before and during the Roman period, but they did not constitute an "empire" in the sense of the British Empire.

**Final Answer:**

No.
