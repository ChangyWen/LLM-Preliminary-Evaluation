Let's break down the timeline of these two significant events to determine the answer.

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the "first airplane flight":** This refers to the flight of the Wright Flyer, piloted by Orville Wright, which took place on **December 17, 1903**, in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

2.  **Identify the "first moon landing":** This refers to the Apollo 11 mission, where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed the Lunar Module "Eagle" on the Moon. This event occurred on **July 20, 1969**.

3.  **Compare the dates:**
    *   First airplane flight: December 17, 1903
    *   First moon landing: July 20, 1969

4.  **Determine the chronological order:** 1903 comes *before* 1969.

5.  **Formulate the conclusion based on the question:** The question asks if the first airplane flight was *after* the first moon landing. Since 1903 is before 1969, the airplane flight was *before* the moon landing, not after.

**Final Answer:**

No
