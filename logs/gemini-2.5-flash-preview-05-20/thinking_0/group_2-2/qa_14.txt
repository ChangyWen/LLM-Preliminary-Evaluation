Let's break down the reasoning process to determine if an elephant has a larger heart than a blue whale.

**Step 1: Understand the Relationship Between Body Size and Organ Size (General Principle)**

*   In general, larger animals tend to have larger organs, including their hearts, to support their greater body mass and metabolic needs. This is a fundamental biological principle.

**Step 2: Compare the Body Sizes of an Elephant and a Blue Whale**

*   **Elephant (African Bush Elephant):**
    *   Weight: Typically 4,000 to 6,000 kg (4 to 6 metric tons)
    *   Length: Up to 7.5 meters (25 feet)
*   **Blue Whale:**
    *   Weight: Typically 100,000 to 200,000 kg (100 to 200 metric tons)
    *   Length: Up to 30 meters (98 feet)

**Step 3: Analyze the Magnitude of the Difference**

*   A blue whale is *significantly* larger than an elephant. A blue whale can weigh 20 to 50 times more than an elephant. It is the largest animal on Earth.

**Step 4: Apply the General Principle to the Specific Animals**

*   Given that the blue whale is vastly larger than an elephant, its heart must also be vastly larger to pump blood throughout its enormous body.

**Step 5: Recall or Research Specific Heart Sizes (if necessary for confirmation, but the logical deduction should be sufficient)**

*   **Elephant Heart:** Can weigh around 12-21 kg (26-46 lbs).
*   **Blue Whale Heart:** Can weigh around 180-200 kg (400-440 lbs), roughly the size of a small car and its aorta is large enough for a human to crawl through.

**Step 6: Formulate the Conclusion**

Based on the overwhelming difference in body size, the blue whale's heart must be considerably larger than an elephant's heart.

**Final Answer:**

No
