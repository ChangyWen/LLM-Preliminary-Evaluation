Let's break down the "day" on Earth and Venus.

**Understanding "Day"**

There are two main ways to define a "day" for a planet:

1.  **Sidereal Day:** The time it takes for a planet to complete one full rotation on its axis relative to the distant stars. This is the planet's true rotational period.
2.  **Solar Day:** The time it takes for the Sun to appear in the same position in the sky (e.g., from noon to noon). This is what we typically experience as a "day" on Earth. It's influenced by both the planet's rotation and its orbital motion around the Sun.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

**1. Earth's Day:**

*   **Earth's Sidereal Day:** Approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds.
*   **Earth's Solar Day:** Approximately 24 hours. The difference is due to Earth's orbital motion around the Sun. As Earth rotates, it also moves along its orbit, so it has to rotate a little bit extra to bring the Sun back to the same apparent position.

**2. Venus's Day:**

*   **Venus's Sidereal Day:** This is where Venus is truly unique. Venus rotates *extremely slowly* and *retrograde* (backward compared to most other planets). Its sidereal day is about **243 Earth days**.
*   **Venus's Orbital Period:** Venus orbits the Sun in about **225 Earth days**.

**3. Comparing Venus's Sidereal Day to its Orbital Period:**

*   Notice that Venus's sidereal day (243 Earth days) is *longer* than its orbital period (225 Earth days). This is highly unusual.

**4. Calculating Venus's Solar Day:**

*   Because Venus rotates so slowly and retrogrades, its solar day calculation is a bit counter-intuitive.
*   For a prograde rotation, the solar day is longer than the sidereal day.
*   For a retrograde rotation, the solar day is *shorter* than the sidereal day.
*   The formula for the solar day (T_solar) is:
    1/T_solar = 1/T_sidereal - 1/T_orbital (for prograde)
    1/T_solar = 1/T_orbital - 1/T_sidereal (for retrograde)
    Let's use the retrograde formula for Venus:
    1/T_solar = 1/225 Earth days - 1/243 Earth days
    1/T_solar = (243 - 225) / (225 * 243)
    1/T_solar = 18 / 54675
    T_solar = 54675 / 18
    T_solar = approximately **121 Earth days**

**5. Comparing Earth's Day to Venus's Day:**

*   **If "day" means Sidereal Day:**
    *   Earth's Sidereal Day: ~24 hours (1 Earth day)
    *   Venus's Sidereal Day: ~243 Earth days
    *   In this case, Venus's sidereal day is *much longer* than Earth's.

*   **If "day" means Solar Day (the more common understanding of a "day"):**
    *   Earth's Solar Day: ~24 hours (1 Earth day)
    *   Venus's Solar Day: ~121 Earth days
    *   In this case, Venus's solar day is *much longer* than Earth's.

**Conclusion:**

Regardless of whether you define "day" as a sidereal day or a solar day, Venus's day is significantly longer than Earth's day.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
