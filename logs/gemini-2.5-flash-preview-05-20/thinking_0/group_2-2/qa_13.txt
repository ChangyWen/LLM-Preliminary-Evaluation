Let's break down the comparison between the Berlin Wall and the Great Wall of China.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand the Nature of Each Structure:**
    *   **Berlin Wall:** A barrier constructed by East Germany from 1961 to 1989, primarily to prevent its citizens from fleeing to West Berlin. It encircled West Berlin.
    *   **Great Wall of China:** A series of fortifications built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China to protect against nomadic groups. It was built over many centuries and consists of various sections, some parallel, some overlapping, and many in ruins.

2.  **Recall/Research the Lengths:**
    *   **Berlin Wall:** The most commonly cited length for the *inner wall* (the one directly facing West Berlin) was approximately **155 kilometers (96 miles)**. This included concrete sections, wire fences, and other barriers.
    *   **Great Wall of China:** This is where it gets a bit more complex due to its nature.
        *   The *official length* released by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage in 2012, after a comprehensive archaeological survey, is **21,196.18 kilometers (13,170.7 miles)**. This figure includes all known sections, including trenches, natural barriers used as part of the defense system, and various dynasties' constructions.
        *   A more commonly cited length for the *main, continuous sections* built during the Ming Dynasty (which is what most people picture) is around **8,850 kilometers (5,500 miles)**.

3.  **Compare the Lengths:**
    *   Berlin Wall: ~155 km
    *   Great Wall of China (official total): ~21,196 km
    *   Great Wall of China (Ming Dynasty main sections): ~8,850 km

4.  **Draw a Conclusion:**
    Even using the most conservative estimate for the Great Wall (the main Ming Dynasty sections), it is vastly longer than the Berlin Wall. When considering the official total length of the Great Wall, the difference is even more staggering.

**Final Answer:**

No
