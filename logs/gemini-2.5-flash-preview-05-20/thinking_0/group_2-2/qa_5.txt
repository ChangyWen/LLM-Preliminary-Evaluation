Let's break down the comparison between Australia and Russia's land area.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks if Australia is *larger in area* than Russia. This requires knowing the land area of both countries.

2.  **Recall/Research Australia's Area:**
    *   Australia's total area is approximately **7,692,024 square kilometers (2,969,907 square miles)**.

3.  **Recall/Research Russia's Area:**
    *   Russia's total area is approximately **17,098,246 square kilometers (6,601,670 square miles)**.

4.  **Compare the two figures:**
    *   Australia: ~7.69 million sq km
    *   Russia: ~17.10 million sq km

5.  **Determine which is larger:** 17.10 million sq km is significantly larger than 7.69 million sq km.

6.  **Formulate the answer based on the comparison:** Since Russia's area is greater than Australia's area, Australia is *not* larger than Russia.

**Final Answer:**

No.
