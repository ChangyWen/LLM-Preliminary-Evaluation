To determine if 98580, WA is located west of 97233, OR, we need to compare their longitudes. A location is west of another if its longitude is further west (i.e., a larger negative number or a smaller positive number if using a 0-360 scale, but typically -180 to +180 is used, where west is negative).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Find the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for 98580, WA.**
    *   Using a reliable geocoding service or database (like Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, or a postal code lookup API), the approximate coordinates for 98580, WA (Shelton, WA) are:
        *   Latitude: ~47.21° N
        *   Longitude: ~-123.10° W

2.  **Find the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for 97233, OR.**
    *   Using a reliable geocoding service or database, the approximate coordinates for 97233, OR (Portland, OR) are:
        *   Latitude: ~45.52° N
        *   Longitude: ~-122.67° W

3.  **Compare the longitudes.**
    *   Longitude of 98580, WA: -123.10° W
    *   Longitude of 97233, OR: -122.67° W

    *   On the standard longitude scale where west is negative, a more negative number indicates a location further west.
    *   Comparing -123.10 and -122.67:
        *   -123.10 is less than -122.67.
        *   Therefore, -123.10° W is further west than -122.67° W.

4.  **Formulate the conclusion.**
    Since the longitude of 98580, WA (-123.10° W) is further west (more negative) than the longitude of 97233, OR (-122.67° W), 98580, WA is located west of 97233, OR.

The final answer is $\boxed{Yes}$
