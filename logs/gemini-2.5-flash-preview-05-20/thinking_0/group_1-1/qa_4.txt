Let's break this down step-by-step to determine the relative locations.

**Step 1: Identify the Borough of Each Location**

*   **WILLIAMSBURG:** While there's a Williamsburg in Brooklyn, the question specifically asks about "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan." This is a crucial point. There is **no neighborhood officially named Williamsburg in Manhattan.** This immediately raises a red flag. It's highly likely the question is either misinformed or intentionally trying to trick you by referring to the Brooklyn neighborhood but placing it in Manhattan.

*   **HILLMAN HOUSES:** Hillman Houses are located in the Lower East Side of **Manhattan**.

**Step 2: Address the Discrepancy for "Williamsburg, Manhattan"**

Since "Williamsburg, Manhattan" doesn't exist as a recognized neighborhood, we have two main interpretations:

*   **Interpretation A (Literal):** If "Williamsburg, Manhattan" literally doesn't exist, then the question is unanswerable in a meaningful way regarding a *specific* location in Manhattan.

*   **Interpretation B (Assumed Intent):** The most common reason someone would say "Williamsburg, Manhattan" is a mistake, and they actually mean **Williamsburg, Brooklyn**. If we proceed with this assumption (which is common in such geographical questions when a location is misattributed), then we need to compare Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to Hillman Houses, Manhattan.

**Step 3: Compare Locations (Assuming Interpretation B - Williamsburg, Brooklyn)**

*   **Williamsburg, Brooklyn:** Located in the northern part of Brooklyn, directly across the East River from the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

*   **Hillman Houses, Manhattan:** Located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, specifically around Grand Street and Lewis Street.

**Step 4: Determine Relative Position**

If you look at a map:
*   Hillman Houses are on the Manhattan side of the East River.
*   Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is on the Brooklyn side of the East River, directly to the east/northeast of the Lower East Side.

To get from Hillman Houses (Lower East Side) to Williamsburg (Brooklyn), you would generally travel *east* across the Williamsburg Bridge or another bridge/tunnel.

Now, let's consider "south of." If you are at Hillman Houses and look south, you are looking towards the Financial District/Battery Park. If you look towards Williamsburg, you are looking generally east or slightly northeast. Williamsburg is not south of Hillman Houses. In fact, if anything, the Lower East Side (where Hillman Houses are) is *southwest* of Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

**Step 5: Re-evaluate based on the "Manhattan" constraint.**

Given the explicit "Manhattan" constraint for Williamsburg, the question is fundamentally flawed. However, if we are forced to answer based on the most likely *intended* meaning (even if geographically incorrect as stated), we must assume the question is asking about Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

**Reasoning Process Summary:**

1.  Identified Hillman Houses as being in the Lower East Side, Manhattan.
2.  Identified "Williamsburg, Manhattan" as a non-existent neighborhood.
3.  Assumed the question *intended* to refer to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, due to common geographical errors in such questions.
4.  Compared the location of Hillman Houses (Lower East Side, Manhattan) with Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
5.  Determined that Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is not south of Hillman Houses; it's generally east/northeast across the East River.

**Final Answer:**

No.
