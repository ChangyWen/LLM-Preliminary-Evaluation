Here's the step-by-step reasoning process to determine if Medina Lake is located north of Rara Lake:

**1. Identify the Key Information Needed:**
To answer this question, we need the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of both Medina Lake and Rara Lake.

**2. Gather Data for Medina Lake:**
* A quick search for "Medina Lake location" reveals it's in Texas, USA.
* More specifically, its approximate coordinates are: **29.48° N latitude, 98.92° W longitude.**

**3. Gather Data for Rara Lake:**
* A quick search for "Rara Lake location" reveals it's in Nepal.
* More specifically, its approximate coordinates are: **29.50° N latitude, 82.08° E longitude.**

**4. Compare Latitudes:**
To determine if one is north of the other, we primarily look at the **latitude**. A higher latitude (closer to 90° N) means it's further north.

* Medina Lake Latitude: 29.48° N
* Rara Lake Latitude: 29.50° N

**5. Analyze the Comparison:**
* 29.50° N (Rara Lake) is slightly higher than 29.48° N (Medina Lake).

**6. Formulate the Conclusion:**
Since Rara Lake has a slightly higher northern latitude than Medina Lake, Rara Lake is located *north* of Medina Lake. Therefore, Medina Lake is *not* located north of Rara Lake.

**Final Answer:**

No
