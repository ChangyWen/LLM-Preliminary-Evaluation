Let's break this down step-by-step to determine if Garnavillo, IA is located east of Newellton, LA.

**Step 1: Identify the States**
* Garnavillo, IA is in Iowa.
* Newellton, LA is in Louisiana.

**Step 2: Understand the General Geographic Relationship of Iowa and Louisiana**
* Iowa is a Midwestern state, located in the northern part of the central United States.
* Louisiana is a Southern state, located in the southern part of the central United States, bordering the Gulf of Mexico.

**Step 3: Visualize or Consult a Map**
Imagine a map of the United States.
* Iowa is significantly to the north of Louisiana.
* Both states are generally in the central part of the country, but Louisiana is further west than the eastern seaboard and Iowa is further west than the Great Lakes region.

**Step 4: Determine East/West Relationship**
To determine if Garnavillo, IA is *east* of Newellton, LA, we need to compare their longitudes.

*   **Garnavillo, IA Coordinates (approximate):** 42.89° N, **91.21° W**
*   **Newellton, LA Coordinates (approximate):** 32.07° N, **91.20° W**

**Step 5: Compare Longitudes**
*   Garnavillo, IA: 91.21° W
*   Newellton, LA: 91.20° W

In the Western Hemisphere, a *smaller* number for longitude means further *east*. A *larger* number means further *west*.

*   91.20° W (Newellton, LA) is slightly *smaller* than 91.21° W (Garnavillo, IA).

Therefore, Newellton, LA is slightly *east* of Garnavillo, IA.

**Step 6: Formulate the Answer**
Since Newellton, LA is slightly east of Garnavillo, IA, it means Garnavillo, IA is slightly west of Newellton, LA.

**Final Answer:** No
