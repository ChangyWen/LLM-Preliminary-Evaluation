Here's my step-by-step reasoning process to determine which article was published earlier:

1.  **Identify the key information needed:** To compare publication dates, I need the full publication date (including year, month, and day) for both articles.

2.  **Search for "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal." publication date:**
    *   A quick search reveals this article was published by The New York Times.
    *   The publication date is **July 26, 2011**.

3.  **Search for "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained." publication date:**
    *   A quick search reveals this article was also published by The New York Times.
    *   The publication date is **September 10, 2013**.

4.  **Compare the dates:**
    *   "Clock Is Ticking..." : July 26, 2011
    *   "Activist Running..." : September 10, 2013

5.  **Determine which is earlier:** 2011 is earlier than 2013.

**Final Answer:** Yes
