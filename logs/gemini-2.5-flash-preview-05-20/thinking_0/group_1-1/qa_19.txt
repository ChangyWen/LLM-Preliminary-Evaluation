Let's break down the process to determine if Eau Claire County, WI is more populous than Platte County, MO.

**Step 1: Identify the key data points needed.**
To compare populations, we need the most recent population estimates for both Eau Claire County, WI, and Platte County, MO.

The most reliable and up-to-date source for county population estimates in the United States is the U.S. Census Bureau. Specifically, their annual population estimates program.

**Step 3: Retrieve the population data for Eau Claire County, WI.**
* Go to the U.S. Census Bureau website (census.gov).
* Search for "Eau Claire County, WI population."
* Look for the most recent *estimate* (not the decennial census count, as that's older). As of my last update, the 2023 estimates are the most recent.

**Step 4: Retrieve the population data for Platte County, MO.**
* Go to the U.S. Census Bureau website (census.gov).
* Search for "Platte County, MO population."

*   **Platte County, MO (2023 Estimate):** Approximately 109,000 - 110,000 (Let's use 109,985 for precision from the 2023 estimate).
