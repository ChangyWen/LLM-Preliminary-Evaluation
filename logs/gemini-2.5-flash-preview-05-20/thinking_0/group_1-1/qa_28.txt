To determine if Þórisvatn has a smaller area than Lake Tohopekaliga, we need to find the area of both lakes and then compare them.

**Step 1: Find the area of Þórisvatn.**
*   Þórisvatn is a lake in Iceland.
*   Its area is approximately **88 km² (or 34 sq mi)**.

**Step 2: Find the area of Lake Tohopekaliga.**
*   Lake Tohopekaliga (often shortened to Lake Toho) is a lake in Florida, USA.
*   Its area is approximately **75.2 km² (or 29.0 sq mi)**.

**Step 3: Compare the areas.**
*   Area of Þórisvatn = 88 km²
*   Area of Lake Tohopekaliga = 75.2 km²

Comparing the two values: 88 km² is greater than 75.2 km².

**Step 4: Formulate the answer to the question.**
The question asks: "Does Þórisvatn have smaller area than Lake Tohopekaliga?"

Since 88 km² is *not* smaller than 75.2 km², the answer is No.

**Final Answer:** No
