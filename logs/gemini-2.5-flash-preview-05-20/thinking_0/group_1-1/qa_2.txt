Let's break this down to determine the release dates.

**Step 1: Find the release date of J. M. Coetzee's *Summertime*.**
*   A quick search reveals that *Summertime* by J. M. Coetzee was first published in **2009**.

**Step 2: Find the release date of Suzanne Collins's *Catching Fire*.**
*   A quick search reveals that *Catching Fire* by Suzanne Collins was first published in **2009**.

**Step 3: Compare the release dates.**
*   *Summertime* (2009)
*   *Catching Fire* (2009)

Both books were released in the same year. While it's possible one was released earlier in the year than the other, the question asks if *Summertime* was released *later* than *Catching Fire*. Based on the year of publication, they were released concurrently. To be definitively "later," it would need to be in a subsequent year.

**Final Answer:** No
