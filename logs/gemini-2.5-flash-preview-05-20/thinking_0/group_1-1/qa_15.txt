**************************************** Content ***************************************
Let's break this down to determine the relative locations of The University of Tampa and Schiller International University in Florida.

**Step 1: Identify the precise locations of each university.**

*   **The University of Tampa (UT):** Located in downtown Tampa, Florida. Specifically, its main campus is on the Hillsborough River, just west of the downtown core.
*   **Schiller International University (SIU):** While Schiller International University has its main campus in Heidelberg, Germany, it *did* have a campus in Florida. This campus was located in **Largo, Florida**.

**Step 2: Understand the geographical relationship between Tampa and Largo.**

*   **Tampa** is a major city on the west coast of Florida, situated at the head of Tampa Bay.
*   **Largo** is a city in Pinellas County, Florida. It is located *west* of Tampa, across Tampa Bay, and *south* of Clearwater.

**Step 3: Visualize or map the locations.**

Imagine a map of the Tampa Bay area:

*   Tampa is on the eastern side of Tampa Bay.
*   Largo is on the western side of Tampa Bay, on the Pinellas County peninsula.

If you draw a line directly north from Largo, you would go through Clearwater and then out into the Gulf of Mexico. If you draw a line directly north from Tampa, you would go through northern Tampa neighborhoods and then into Pasco County.

**Step 4: Determine the north/south relationship.**

Since Largo is west of Tampa, and slightly south in terms of latitude when considering the general metropolitan area, let's be precise.

*   The University of Tampa's coordinates are approximately 27.948째 N latitude.
*   Schiller International University's former campus in Largo's coordinates are approximately 27.909째 N latitude.

A higher latitude number indicates a more northerly position.

**Step 5: Compare the latitudes.**

*   The University of Tampa: ~27.948째 N
*   Schiller International University (Largo): ~27.909째 N

Since 27.948 is greater than 27.909, The University of Tampa is at a higher latitude.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
