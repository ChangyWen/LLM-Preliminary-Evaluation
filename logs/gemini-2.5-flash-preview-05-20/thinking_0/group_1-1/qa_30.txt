Let's break down the reasoning process to determine if Pragser Wildsee is located west of Lake Vico.

**Step 1: Identify the locations of each body of water.**

*   **Pragser Wildsee (Lake Braies):** This lake is located in the Dolomites, South Tyrol, Italy.
*   **Lake Vico:** This lake is located in the Lazio region of central Italy, north of Rome.

**Step 2: Determine the approximate latitude and longitude for each location.**

*   **Pragser Wildsee:**
    *   Latitude: Approximately 46.69° N
    *   Longitude: Approximately 12.08° E
*   **Lake Vico:**
    *   Latitude: Approximately 42.32° N
    *   Longitude: Approximately 12.17° E

**Step 3: Compare the longitudes to determine the east/west relationship.**

*   A location is "west" of another if its longitude value is *smaller* (further west on the globe).
*   A location is "east" of another if its longitude value is *larger* (further east on the globe).

Comparing the longitudes:
*   Pragser Wildsee: 12.08° E
*   Lake Vico: 12.17° E

Since 12.08° E (Pragser Wildsee) is *smaller* than 12.17° E (Lake Vico), Pragser Wildsee is located to the west of Lake Vico.

**Step 4: Formulate the final answer.**

Yes.

**Final Answer:** Yes
