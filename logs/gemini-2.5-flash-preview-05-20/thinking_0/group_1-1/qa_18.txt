**Step 1: Find the approximate location of Cambria County, PA.**
*   Cambria County is located in west-central Pennsylvania.
*   Its approximate coordinates are around 40.5° N latitude and 78.8° W longitude.

*   Its approximate coordinates are around 42.2° N latitude and 78.7° W longitude.

**Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**
