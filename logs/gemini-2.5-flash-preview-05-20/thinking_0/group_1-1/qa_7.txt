Here's the step-by-step reasoning process to determine if Anastasia of Sirmium lived longer than William II, Count of Chalon:

**Step 1: Identify the lifespan of Anastasia of Sirmium.**
* Anastasia of Sirmium was a Christian saint and martyr.
* Her martyrdom is traditionally dated to **304 AD**.
* We don't have a birth date for her, but her life ended in 304 AD.

**Step 2: Identify the lifespan of William II, Count of Chalon.**
* William II, Count of Chalon, was a historical figure.
* Historical records indicate he was born around **1175 AD**.
* He died in **1202 AD**.

**Step 3: Compare the lifespans.**
* Anastasia's life ended in 304 AD.
* William II's life ended in 1202 AD.

**Step 4: Determine who lived longer.**
* Since Anastasia's life ended in 304 AD, and William II's life ended in 1202 AD, William II lived much, much later than Anastasia.
* The question asks if Anastasia lived *longer* than William II. This implies comparing the *duration* of their lives.
* We don't know Anastasia's birth year, so we can't calculate the exact duration of her life. However, we know her life *ended* in 304 AD.
* William II lived for approximately 27 years (1202 - 1175).

**Step 5: Re-evaluate the question's intent.**
The question "Did Anastasia of Sirmium live longer than William II, Count of Chalon?" is tricky because we don't have Anastasia's birth year. However, the phrasing usually implies comparing the *period of time they were alive*.

* If Anastasia was born, for example, in 280 AD and died in 304 AD, she lived 24 years.
* If William II lived from 1175 AD to 1202 AD, he lived 27 years.

Even if Anastasia lived to be very old (e.g., 80 years old, born in 224 AD), her life *ended* in 304 AD. William II's life *began* over 800 years after Anastasia's life ended.

The question is not asking who died later, but who lived for a greater *duration*. Without Anastasia's birth year, we cannot definitively calculate the duration of her life.

However, the common understanding of such a question, especially when one figure is from antiquity and the other from the Middle Ages, is often about the *era* they lived in, or if their lifespans *overlapped*. They did not.

Let's assume the question is asking if the *duration* of Anastasia's life was greater than the *duration* of William II's life.

* William II's lifespan: 1202 - 1175 = 27 years.
* Anastasia's death: 304 AD. We don't know her birth year.

Since we don't have Anastasia's birth year, we cannot definitively say she lived longer. It's possible she lived for 10 years, or 50 years, or 80 years.

**Crucial point:** The question is not "Did Anastasia of Sirmium die later than William II, Count of Chalon?" (The answer to that would be no). It's about the *length of their lives*.

Given the lack of a birth date for Anastasia, we cannot calculate the duration of her life. Therefore, we cannot compare it to William II's lifespan.

**Final Answer Derivation:**
We know William II lived for approximately 27 years. We only know Anastasia's death year (304 AD). Without her birth year, we cannot determine the length of her life. Therefore, we cannot compare the duration of her life to William II's.

The answer is **No**, because we cannot confirm she lived longer due to missing information. It's impossible to prove she lived longer.

The final answer is $\boxed{No}$
