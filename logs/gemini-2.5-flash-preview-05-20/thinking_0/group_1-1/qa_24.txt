Let's break down how to determine if 83703 (ID) is less densely populated than 79104 (TX).

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand "Densely Populated":** Densely populated means a high number of people per unit of area (etypically square miles or square kilometers). To compare density, we need two key pieces of information for each zip code:
    *   Population
    *   Land Area

2.  **Identify Data Sources:** We need reliable sources for population and land area data for US zip codes. Common and reliable sources include:
    *   US Census Bureau (though direct zip code data can be tricky, it's the underlying source for many others)
    *   Data aggregators like City-Data.com, Zip-Codes.com, or statistical websites that compile Census data.

3.  **Gather Data for 83703 (Boise, ID):**
    *   **Population (approximate, as of recent estimates/Census):** Around 25,000 - 30,000 people.
    *   **Land Area (approximate):** Around 10-15 square miles.
    *   **Calculation for 83703 Density:** Population / Land Area = (e.g., 28,000 people / 12 sq mi) ≈ 2,333 people/sq mi

4.  **Gather Data for 79104 (Amarillo, TX):**
    *   **Population (approximate, as of recent estimates/Census):** Around 15,000 - 20,000 people.
    *   **Land Area (approximate):** Around 20-25 square miles.
    *   **Calculation for 79104 Density:** Population / Land Area = (e.g., 18,000 people / 22 sq mi) ≈ 818 people/sq mi

5.  **Compare Densities:**
    *   Density of 83703: ~2,333 people/sq mi
    *   Density of 79104: ~818 people/sq mi

6.  **Formulate Conclusion:** Since 2,333 is greater than 818, 83703 is *more* densely populated than 79104. Therefore, 83703 is *not* less densely populated than 79104.

**Final Answer:**

No
