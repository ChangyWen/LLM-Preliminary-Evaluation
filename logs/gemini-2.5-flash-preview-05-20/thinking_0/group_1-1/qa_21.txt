Let's break this down to determine if the Sangre de Cristo Range, CO is located east of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand the Terminology:**
    *   "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" refers to the mountain range itself, which is a geographical feature.
    *   "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" is essentially another way of referring to the *same* geographical feature â€“ the Sangre de Cristo mountain range. The terms are often used interchangeably or refer to the same general area.

2.  **Identify the Relationship:** The "Sangre de Cristo Range" *is* the "Sangre de Cristo Mountains." They are not two separate, distinct geographical entities where one could be east of the other. It's like asking if "Mount Everest" is east of "Mount Everest."

3.  **Consider Geographical Context:** If you look at a map of Colorado, you'll see the Sangre de Cristo Range running generally north-south through the south-central part of the state. There isn't a separate, distinct "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" that lies to its west or east. The "mountains" *are* the "range."

4.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Since "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" refer to the same geographical feature, one cannot be located east of the other. They occupy the same space.

**Final Answer:**

No
