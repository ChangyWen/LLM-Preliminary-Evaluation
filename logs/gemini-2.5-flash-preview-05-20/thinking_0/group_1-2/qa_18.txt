Let's break this down step-by-step to determine if Cattaraugus County, NY is located west of Cambria County, PA.

**Step 1: Identify the general location of each county.**

*   **Cattaraugus County, NY:** This county is located in southwestern New York State, bordering Pennsylvania.
*   **Cambria County, PA:** This county is located in west-central Pennsylvania.

**Step 2: Visualize or look up a map of the two states and counties.**

*   Imagine a map of the northeastern United States.
*   New York is to the north of Pennsylvania.

**Step 3: Determine the relative east-west position.**

*   If you were to draw a line directly south from Cattaraugus County, NY, you would land in north-central Pennsylvania.
*   Cambria County, PA, is located significantly further *west* within Pennsylvania than the area directly south of Cattaraugus County.

**Step 4: Consider the longitude.**

*   A more precise way to determine east-west position is by comparing longitudes.
    *   **Cattaraugus County, NY:** Its approximate longitude range is from about 78.5°W to 79.5°W.
    *   **Cambria County, PA:** Its approximate longitude range is from about 78.5°W to 79.0°W.

**Step 5: Analyze the longitude comparison.**

While there's some overlap in the longitude ranges, the *bulk* of Cattaraugus County extends further west than the bulk of Cambria County. However, the key question is "west of."

Let's re-evaluate the visual and general geographic placement.

*   Cattaraugus County is in the *southwestern* corner of New York.
*   Cambria County is in the *west-central* part of Pennsylvania.

If you place your finger on Cattaraugus County on a map and then move it to Cambria County, you would generally move *south and slightly east*.

Let's use a more definitive point for comparison, like the county seats or approximate centers:

*   **Little Valley, NY (Cattaraugus County seat):** Approximately 42.2°N, 78.8°W
*   **Ebensburg, PA (Cambria County seat):** Approximately 40.5°N, 78.7°W

Comparing the longitudes:
*   Little Valley: 78.8°W
*   Ebensburg: 78.7°W

A higher number in West longitude means further west. So, 78.8°W is *west* of 78.7°W.

However, this is comparing specific points. Let's consider the overall extent.

*   The westernmost point of Cattaraugus County is near 79.5°W.
*   The westernmost point of Cambria County is near 79.0°W.

This confirms that Cattaraugus County extends further west.

Now, let's consider the question "west of." If something is west of another, it means it's to the left on a map.

Imagine a vertical line drawn through the eastern edge of Cambria County. Is any part of Cattaraugus County to the west of that line? Yes, a significant portion of Cattaraugus County is west of the easternmost longitudes of Cambria County.

Conversely, imagine a vertical line drawn through the western edge of Cambria County. Is any part of Cattaraugus County to the west of that line? Yes, the western part of Cattaraugus County is west of the western part of Cambria County.

**Final Check:**
If you look at a map, Cattaraugus County is in the southwest corner of NY. Cambria County is in west-central PA. While Cambria County is *south* of Cattaraugus County, it is also generally *east* of the westernmost parts of Cattaraugus County.

Let's re-evaluate the longitude data carefully.
*   Cattaraugus County's western border is roughly 79.5°W. Its eastern border is roughly 78.5°W.
*   Cambria County's western border is roughly 79.0°W. Its eastern border is roughly 78.5°W.

This means that the western part of Cattaraugus County (from 79.0°W to 79.5°W) is indeed west of *all* of Cambria County.

**Reasoning Process Summary:**
1.  Identified general locations: Cattaraugus (SW NY), Cambria (W-central PA).
2.  Recognized NY is north of PA.
3.  Compared longitudes for a precise east-west determination.
    *   Cattaraugus County's longitude range: ~78.5°W to ~79.5°W
    *   Cambria County's longitude range: ~78.5°W to ~79.0°W
4.  Observed that the westernmost extent of Cattaraugus County (~79.5°W) is further west (higher W longitude) than the westernmost extent of Cambria County (~79.0°W).
5.  Concluded that because Cattaraugus County extends to a longitude further west than any part of Cambria County, it is indeed located west of Cambria County.

The final answer is $\boxed{Yes}$
