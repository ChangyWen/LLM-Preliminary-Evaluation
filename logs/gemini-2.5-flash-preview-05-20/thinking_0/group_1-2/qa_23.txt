Let's break down how to determine if St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV is located east of Pine Flat Dam, CA.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the Locations and Their States:**
    *   St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church: Nevada (NV)
    *   Pine Flat Dam: California (CA)

2.  **Understand Geographic Orientation:**
    *   "East of" means that if you were standing at Pine Flat Dam, St. Mary's would be in the direction of the rising sun relative to your position.
    *   Generally, states in the Western US are arranged with California to the west of Nevada.

3.  **Visualize or Look Up State Positions:**
    *   If you look at a map of the United States, California is the westernmost state on the mainland, bordering the Pacific Ocean.
    *   Nevada is directly to the east of California.

4.  **Determine Relative Position of the States:**
    *   Since Nevada is geographically to the east of California, any location within Nevada will generally be east of any location within California, assuming they are at similar latitudes.

5.  **Confirm Specific Locations (Optional but good for accuracy):**
    *   **Pine Flat Dam, CA:** Located in Fresno County, California. Its approximate coordinates are 36.86° N, 119.33° W.
    *   **St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV:** Located in Virginia City, Storey County, Nevada. Its approximate coordinates are 39.30° N, 119.65° W.

6.  **Compare Longitudes:**
    *   Pine Flat Dam: ~119.33° W
    *   St. Mary's in the Mountains: ~119.65° W

    *   **Crucial Point for Longitude:** In the Western Hemisphere, *smaller* (less negative) West longitude numbers are *further east*. *Larger* (more negative) West longitude numbers are *further west*.
    *   119.33 is *smaller* than 119.65.
    *   Therefore, Pine Flat Dam (119.33° W) is *east* of St. Mary's in the Mountains (119.65° W).

7.  **Re-evaluate based on Longitude Comparison:** My initial assumption based on state position was that Nevada is east of California. While this is true for the states as a whole, specific points can vary. The longitude comparison shows that St. Mary's in the Mountains (119.65° W) is actually *west* of Pine Flat Dam (119.33° W).

**Final Answer:**

No
