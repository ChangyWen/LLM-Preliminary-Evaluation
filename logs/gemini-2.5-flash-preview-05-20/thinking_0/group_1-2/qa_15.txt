Let's break this down step-by-step to determine the relative location of Schiller International University, FL and The University of Tampa, FL.

**Step 1: Identify the full and correct names/locations of the institutions.**

*   **Schiller International University, FL:** While Schiller International University has a presence in Florida, its primary campus and the one most commonly referred to in Florida is in **Largo, FL**. It's important to note that Schiller has multiple campuses globally, but the question specifically mentions "FL".
*   **The University of Tampa, FL:** This is clearly located in **Tampa, FL**.

**Step 2: Determine the approximate geographical coordinates or general location of each city/campus.**

*   **Largo, FL:** Largo is a city in Pinellas County, Florida. It's located on the Pinellas Peninsula, west of Tampa Bay. Its approximate latitude is around **27.9° N**.
*   **Tampa, FL:** Tampa is a city in Hillsborough County, Florida. It's located on the eastern side of Tampa Bay. Its approximate latitude is also around **27.9° N**.

**Step 3: Compare the latitudes to determine the North/South relationship.**

*   When comparing locations for "north" or "south," we primarily look at their **latitude**. A higher latitude means further north, and a lower latitude means further south.

*   Largo, FL (approx. 27.9° N)
*   Tampa, FL (approx. 27.9° N)

**Step 4: Analyze the comparison.**

Upon closer inspection of a map or more precise coordinates:

*   The main campus of Schiller International University in Florida is indeed in **Largo, FL**.
*   The University of Tampa is in **Tampa, FL**.

While both cities are very close in latitude and are essentially at the same "horizontal" level on a map, if we look at the specific campus locations:

*   The University of Tampa is located at approximately **27.94° N**.
*   Schiller International University's campus in Largo is located at approximately **27.91° N**.

**Step 5: Formulate the final answer based on the latitude comparison.**

Since 27.91° N (Schiller) is *less* than 27.94° N (University of Tampa), Schiller International University, FL (Largo) is slightly **south** of The University of Tampa, FL.

**Final Answer:** No.
