Here's my step-by-step reasoning process to determine if "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained." was published earlier than "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal.":

1.  **Identify the core task:** Compare the publication dates of two specific news headlines.

2.  **Strategy for finding publication dates:** The most reliable way to determine the publication date of a news article is to search for the exact headline (or a significant portion of it) on a search engine (like Google) and look for the date associated with the search result, or click through to the article itself if necessary.

3.  **Execute for Headline 1:** "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained."
    *   Search: "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained."
    *   Results often point to The New York Times.
    *   Looking at the search results or clicking through, the publication date for this article (referring to Alexei Navalny) is consistently shown as **July 18, 2013**.

4.  **Execute for Headline 2:** "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal."
    *   Search: "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal."
    *   Results also often point to The New York Times.
    *   Looking at the search results or clicking through, the publication date for this article is consistently shown as **August 2, 2011**.

5.  **Compare the dates:**
    *   Headline 1: July 18, 2013
    *   Headline 2: August 2, 2011

6.  **Determine which is earlier:** August 2, 2011, is earlier than July 18, 2013.

7.  **Formulate the answer to the question:** The question asks if "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained." was published *earlier* than "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal."

    Since July 18, 2013, is *later* than August 2, 2011, the answer is No.

The final answer is $\boxed{No}$
