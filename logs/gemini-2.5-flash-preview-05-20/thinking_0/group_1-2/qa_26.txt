Let's break down how to determine if 97233, OR is west of 98580, WA.

**Step 1: Understand "West Of" in Geographic Terms**

In geography, "west of" means having a smaller (more negative) longitude value. Longitude lines run north-south, and they are measured in degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian (0 degrees longitude). Locations to the west of the Prime Meridian have negative longitude values, and the further west you go, the more negative the number becomes.

**Step 2: Find the Geographic Coordinates (Latitude and Longitude) for Each ZIP Code**

We need to look up the approximate central coordinates for each ZIP code.

*   **97233, OR:** This ZIP code is located in Portland, Oregon.
    *   Approximate Latitude: 45.45° N
    *   Approximate Longitude: -122.60° W (or 122.60° West)

*   **98580, WA:** This ZIP code is located in Shelton, Washington.
    *   Approximate Latitude: 47.21° N
    *   Approximate Longitude: -123.10° W (or 123.10° West)

**Step 3: Compare the Longitude Values**

Now, let's compare the longitude values:

*   97233, OR: -122.60°
*   98580, WA: -123.10°

**Step 4: Determine Which is "More West"**

Remember, a more negative longitude value means it's further west.

*   -123.10 is a smaller (more negative) number than -122.60.

Therefore, 98580, WA is further west than 97233, OR.

**Step 5: Answer the Question**

The question asks: "Is 97233, OR located west of 98580, WA?"

Since 98580, WA is at -123.10° longitude and 97233, OR is at -122.60° longitude, 97233, OR is actually *east* of 98580, WA.

**Final Answer:** No
