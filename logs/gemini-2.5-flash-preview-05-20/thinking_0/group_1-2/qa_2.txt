Here's my step-by-step reasoning process to determine if Catching Fire was released later than Summertime:

1.  **Identify the key information needed:** I need the release dates for both "Catching Fire" by Suzanne Collins and "Summertime" by J. M. Coetzee.

2.  **Find the release date for "Catching Fire":**
    *   A quick search reveals that "Catching Fire" was published on **September 1, 2009**.

3.  **Find the release date for "Summertime":**
    *   A quick search reveals that "Summertime" was published on **September 1, 2009**.

4.  **Compare the dates:**
    *   Catching Fire: September 1, 2009
    *   Summertime: September 1, 2009

5.  **Determine if "Catching Fire" was released *later*:**
    *   Since both books were released on the exact same day, "Catching Fire" was *not* released later than "Summertime." They were released concurrently.

**Final Answer:** No
