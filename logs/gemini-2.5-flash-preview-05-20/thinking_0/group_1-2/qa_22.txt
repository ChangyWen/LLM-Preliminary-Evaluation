Let's break this down step-by-step to determine if the Dal-Tex Building, TX is south of Lake Martin, AL.

**Step 1: Identify the locations and their states.**
*   **Dal-Tex Building:** Dallas, Texas (TX)
*   **Lake Martin:** Alabama (AL)

**Step 2: Understand the relative geographical positions of Texas and Alabama.**
*   Texas is in the southwestern/south-central United States.
*   Alabama is in the southeastern United States.
*   Generally, Texas is to the west of Alabama.

**Step 3: Determine the approximate latitude of each location.**
*   **Dallas, TX:** Dallas is located at approximately 32.7° N latitude.
*   **Lake Martin, AL:** Lake Martin is located at approximately 32.7° N latitude. (Specifically, its northernmost point is around 32.8° N, and its southernmost point is around 32.6° N).

**Step 4: Compare the latitudes.**
*   Dallas, TX (approx. 32.7° N)
*   Lake Martin, AL (approx. 32.7° N)

**Step 5: Interpret the comparison.**
When comparing latitudes, a lower latitude number means a location is further south. Since both locations are at very similar latitudes (essentially the same parallel), neither is significantly north or south of the other in a general sense. They are more or less at the same "horizontal" level on a map.

**Step 6: Formulate the final answer based on the comparison.**
Because their latitudes are so similar, the Dal-Tex Building is not south of Lake Martin. They are roughly at the same latitude.

**Final Answer:** No
