Let's break down the release dates to determine which song came out first.

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the Dream Theater song:** The song in question is "Pull Me Under."
2.  **Find the release date of "Pull Me Under":** "Pull Me Under" was released as a single in **1992**. It also appeared on their album *Images and Words*, which was released in **1992**.
3.  **Identify the Beastie Boys song:** The song in question is "Jimmy James."
4.  **Find the release date of "Jimmy James":** "Jimmy James" appeared on the Beastie Boys album *Check Your Head*, which was released on **April 21, 1992**.

5.  **Compare the dates:**
    *   Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under": 1992
    *   Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James": April 21, 1992

    While both were released in 1992, "Pull Me Under" was released as a single *before* the *Images and Words* album, and the album itself was released in July 1992. However, the single for "Pull Me Under" was out earlier in 1992. More specifically, the single for "Pull Me Under" was released in **August 1992**, and the album *Images and Words* was released on **July 7, 1992**.

    Let's re-evaluate with precise dates:
    *   Dream Theater's *Images and Words* (containing "Pull Me Under"): **July 7, 1992**
    *   Beastie Boys' *Check Your Head* (containing "Jimmy James"): **April 21, 1992**

**Final Answer:**

No. Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James" (April 21, 1992) was released earlier than Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under" (July 7, 1992).
