**************************************** Content ***************************************
Let's break down this question step-by-step to determine if the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO are located east of the Sangre de Cristo Range, CO.

**Understanding the Terms:**

*   **Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO:** This refers to the mountain range itself, specifically the portion within Colorado.
*   **Sangre de Cristo Range, CO:** This is essentially the same thing as "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO." The terms "mountains" and "range" are often used interchangeably when referring to a continuous chain of mountains.

**The Core Problem:**

The question is asking if a geographic feature (the Sangre de Cristo Mountains/Range) is located *east* of itself. This is a trick question based on the phrasing.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1.  **Identify the Subject:** The subject of the question is the "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO."
2.  **Identify the Reference Point:** The reference point for comparison is the "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO."
3.  **Compare Subject and Reference Point:** As established, "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" and "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" refer to the *same geographic entity*. They are not distinct, separate locations where one could be east of the other.
4.  **Apply Directional Logic:** A single entity cannot be "east of itself." If you are standing *in* the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, you are *in* the Sangre de Cristo Range. You cannot be simultaneously east of it.

**Final Answer:**

No.
