Let's break down how to determine if "Birdman" is shorter than "The Abolition of Britain" in terms of page count.

**Step-by-step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the Goal:** The core question is about the *length* of the books, specifically in terms of page count.

2.  **Determine the Key Metric:** Page count is the standard way to compare the physical length of books.

3.  **Locate Page Count for "Birdman":**
    *   A quick search (e.g., Goodreads, Amazon, publisher websites) for "Mo Hayder Birdman page count" reveals various editions.
    *   Common page counts for the paperback/hardcover editions are around **384 pages** (e.g., the Bantam paperback). Some editions might vary slightly, but this is a good representative number.

4.  **Locate Page Count for "The Abolition of Britain":**
    *   A quick search (e.g., Goodreads, Amazon, publisher websites) for "Peter Hitchens The Abolition of Britain page count" reveals its length.
    *   Common page counts for the paperback/hardcover editions are around **256 pages** (e.g., the Encounter Books paperback).

5.  **Compare the Page Counts:**
    *   Birdman: ~384 pages
    *   The Abolition of Britain: ~256 pages

6.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** 384 is greater than 256. Therefore, "Birdman" is *longer* than "The Abolition of Britain."

7.  **Answer the Question Directly:** The question asks if "Birdman" is *shorter*. Since it's longer, the answer is No.

**Final Answer:**
