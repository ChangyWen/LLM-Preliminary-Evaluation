Let's break down the reasoning process to determine if Rara Lake is south of Medina Lake.

**Step 1: Identify the locations of each lake.**

*   **Rara Lake:** Located in the Mugu District of Nepal.
*   **Medina Lake:** Located in Bandera and Medina counties, Texas, USA.

**Step 2: Determine the general geographical position of each country/region.**

*   **Nepal:** A country in South Asia, situated in the Himalayas.
*   **Texas, USA:** A state in the southern United States of America, part of North America.

**Step 3: Compare the latitudes of the two locations.**

*   **Nepal (and specifically Rara Lake):** Generally located at latitudes between approximately 26°N and 30°N. Rara Lake itself is around 29.5°N.
*   **Texas (and specifically Medina Lake):** Generally located at latitudes between approximately 25°N and 36°N. Medina Lake itself is around 29.5°N.

**Step 4: Analyze the longitudinal difference and global context.**

While both lakes are at very similar latitudes (around 29.5°N), their longitudes are vastly different.

*   Rara Lake is in Asia (around 82°E).
*   Medina Lake is in North America (around 99°W).

This means they are on opposite sides of the globe, but at roughly the same distance north of the equator.

**Step 5: Define "south of" in a geographical context.**

"South of" means having a lower latitude (being closer to the South Pole or further from the North Pole) than the reference point.

**Step 6: Compare the latitudes directly.**

*   Rara Lake: ~29.5°N
*   Medina Lake: ~29.5°N

Since their latitudes are essentially the same, neither is "south of" the other in the strict geographical sense of being at a lower latitude. They are at roughly the same parallel of latitude.

**Final Answer:**

No.
