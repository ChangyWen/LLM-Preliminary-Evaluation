Let's break this down step-by-step to determine if Hillman Houses is south of Williamsburg, Manhattan.

**Step 1: Identify the location of Hillman Houses.**
* Hillman Houses is a housing cooperative located in the **Lower East Side** of Manhattan.
* Its approximate coordinates are around 100-160 Pitt Street, New York, NY.

**Step 2: Identify the location of Williamsburg.**
* This is a crucial point. **Williamsburg is NOT in Manhattan.**
* Williamsburg is a neighborhood located in the **borough of Brooklyn**, New York City.
* It is situated across the East River from Manhattan.

**Step 3: Compare the locations.**
* Hillman Houses (Lower East Side, Manhattan)
* Williamsburg (Brooklyn)

**Step 4: Determine the relative position.**
Since Williamsburg is in a completely different borough (Brooklyn) and across the East River from Manhattan, it cannot be directly compared as "south of" or "north of" a specific location *within* Manhattan in the way the question implies.

However, if we consider the general geographical relationship:
* The Lower East Side (where Hillman Houses is) is on the southeastern side of Manhattan.
* Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is generally to the east/southeast of the Lower East Side, across the East River.

The question asks if Hillman Houses is *south of* Williamsburg, Manhattan. Since Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, the premise of the question is flawed.

**Final Answer:** No
