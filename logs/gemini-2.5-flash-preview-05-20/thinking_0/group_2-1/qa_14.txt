Let's break down the comparison of heart size between a blue whale and an elephant, using a step-by-step reasoning process.

**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Heart Size and Body Size**

Generally, heart size is proportional to body size. Larger animals need larger hearts to pump blood throughout their more extensive circulatory systems and supply oxygen to a greater mass of tissue.

**Step 2: Compare the Body Sizes of a Blue Whale and an Elephant**

*   **Blue Whale:** The largest animal on Earth.
    *   Length: Up to 30 meters (98 feet)
    *   Weight: Up to 200 metric tons (440,000 pounds)
*   **Elephant (African Bush Elephant, the largest land animal):**
    *   Height: Up to 4 meters (13 feet)
    *   Weight: Up to 6 metric tons (13,000 pounds)

**Step 3: Relate Body Size to Expected Heart Size**

Given the enormous difference in body mass (a blue whale can be over 30 times heavier than an elephant), we would expect the blue whale's heart to be significantly larger.

**Step 4: Recall or Research Specific Heart Size Information (if available and necessary for confirmation)**

*   **Blue Whale Heart:** Often described as being the size of a small car (like a Volkswagen Beetle) or a golf cart. It can weigh around 600 kg (1,300 lbs). Its aorta alone is large enough for a human to crawl through.
*   **Elephant Heart:** Weighs approximately 12-21 kg (26-46 lbs). It's roughly the size of a basketball.

**Step 5: Compare the Specific Heart Sizes**

*   Blue Whale Heart: ~600 kg
*   Elephant Heart: ~12-21 kg

**Step 6: Draw a Conclusion**

The blue whale's heart is orders of magnitude larger than an elephant's heart.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
