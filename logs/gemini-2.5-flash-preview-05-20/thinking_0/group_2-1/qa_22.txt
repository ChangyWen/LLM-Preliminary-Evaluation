Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine if Brazil is located south of Canada:

1.  **Understand the Question:** The core question is about the relative north-south position of Brazil and Canada.

2.  **Recall/Research Geographic Locations (Continents):**
    *   Canada is in North America.
    *   Brazil is in South America.

3.  **Recall/Research Relative Positions of Continents:**
    *   North America is generally *north* of South America. They are connected by a relatively narrow land bridge (Central America/Panama).

4.  **Visualize/Conceptualize a World Map:**
    *   Imagine a line of latitude.
    *   Canada occupies a significant portion of northern North America.
    *   Brazil occupies a significant portion of central and eastern South America.

5.  **Determine Latitude Ranges (Approximate):**
    *   **Canada:** Extends from roughly 41째N to 83째N.
    *   **Brazil:** Extends from roughly 5째N to 34째S.

6.  **Compare Latitude Ranges:**
    *   All of Canada's territory is in the Northern Hemisphere (north of the equator).
    *   Most of Brazil's territory is in the Southern Hemisphere (south of the equator), with a small portion extending just north of the equator.

7.  **Draw a Conclusion based on Comparison:** Since Canada is entirely in the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere, and Brazil is predominantly in the Southern Hemisphere (and even its northernmost tip is still significantly south of the bulk of Canada), Brazil is indeed located south of Canada.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
