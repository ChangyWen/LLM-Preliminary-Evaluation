Let's break down the reasoning process to determine if the wavelength of red light is longer than that of blue light.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand the Electromagnetic Spectrum:** Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses a wide range of wavelengths and frequencies, from radio waves to gamma rays. Visible light is a small portion of this spectrum.

2.  **Recall the Order of Colors in the Visible Spectrum:** The visible light spectrum is often remembered by the acronym ROYGBIV:
    *   **R**ed
    *   **O**range
    *   **Y**ellow
    *   **G**reen
    *   **B**lue
    *   **I**ndigo
    *   **V**iolet

3.  **Relate Color to Wavelength:** Within the visible spectrum, colors are ordered by their wavelength.
    *   At one end (Red), the wavelengths are the longest.
    *   At the other end (Violet), the wavelengths are the shortest.

4.  **Locate Red and Blue on the Spectrum:**
    *   Red is at the "long wavelength" end of the visible spectrum.
    *   Blue is closer to the "short wavelength" end of the visible spectrum, after green and before indigo/violet.

5.  **Compare Their Positions:** Since red is at the end associated with longer wavelengths and blue is closer to the end associated with shorter wavelengths, red light must have a longer wavelength than blue light.

6.  **Consider Energy and Frequency (Optional but helpful for deeper understanding):**
    *   The speed of light ($c$) is constant in a vacuum.
    *   The relationship between speed, wavelength ($\lambda$), and frequency ($f$) is $c = \lambda f$.
    *   This means that wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional: if wavelength increases, frequency decreases, and vice-versa.
    *   The energy ($E$) of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency: $E = hf$ (where $h$ is Planck's constant).
    *   Therefore, longer wavelength light has lower frequency and lower energy. Shorter wavelength light has higher frequency and higher energy.
    *   Red light has lower energy than blue light, which is consistent with it having a longer wavelength. Blue light has higher energy than red light, consistent with it having a shorter wavelength.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
