Let's break down the comparison between a peregrine falcon and an eagle to determine which is faster.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the Key Characteristic for "Faster":** In the context of birds, "faster" typically refers to their flight speed, specifically their *diving speed* (stoop) for falcons and their *cruising/hunting speed* for eagles.

2.  **Recall Known Information about Peregrine Falcons:**
    *   Peregrine falcons are renowned for their incredible hunting technique called a "stoop."
    *   During a stoop, they dive from great heights at extremely high speeds to catch prey.
    *   They are widely recognized as the fastest animal on Earth in a dive.
    *   Specific speeds often cited are over 200 mph (around 320 km/h), with some measurements even higher.

3.  **Recall Known Information about Eagles:**
    *   Eagles (a broad category including various species like Golden Eagles, Bald Eagles, etc.) are large, powerful raptors.
    *   They are known for their impressive wingspan, soaring ability, and powerful flight.
    *   They are fast and agile hunters, but their primary hunting method doesn't involve the same type of high-speed vertical dive as a peregrine.
    *   Their top speeds in level flight or a hunting dive are generally in the range of 75-100 mph (120-160 km/h). While fast, this is significantly less than a peregrine's stoop.

4.  **Compare the Speeds:**
    *   Peregrine Falcon (stoop): 200+ mph (320+ km/h)
    *   Eagle (hunting dive/level flight): 75-100 mph (120-160 km/h)

5.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Based on the comparison of their maximum recorded speeds, particularly the peregrine's specialized hunting dive, the peregrine falcon is significantly faster.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
