Let's break down the comparison between a cheetah and a lion in terms of speed.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the primary characteristic being compared:** The question is about "faster," which directly relates to speed.

2.  **Recall general knowledge about cheetahs:**
    *   Cheetahs are known for their incredibly specialized bodies designed for speed.
    *   Key physical adaptations include:
        *   Flexible spine (allows for extreme reach and retraction of limbs)
        *   Non-retractable claws (act like running spikes for grip)
        *   Long, muscular legs
        *   Large nostrils and lungs (for rapid oxygen intake)
        *   Long tail (for balance during high-speed turns)
    *   Their hunting strategy relies almost entirely on short, explosive bursts of speed to catch prey.

3.  **Recall general knowledge about lions:**
    *   Lions are powerful, large felines.
    *   Their hunting strategy often involves:
        *   Ambush
        *   Cooperative hunting (working in prides)
        *   Stalking
    *   While they can run fast, their build is more geared towards power, strength, and endurance over short distances, rather than the extreme acceleration and top speed of a cheetah. They are built for taking down large prey, which requires immense force.

4.  **Compare peak speeds (if known or estimable):**
    *   Cheetahs are widely recognized as the fastest land animals. Their top recorded speeds are in the range of 70-75 mph (112-120 km/h).
    *   Lions' top speeds are typically in the range of 50 mph (80 km/h).

5.  **Consider the nature of their speed:**
    *   Cheetahs: Built for *maximum top speed* over *very short distances* (sprints). They cannot maintain these speeds for long.
    *   Lions: Capable of *fast bursts* but not the same *peak speed* as a cheetah. They can maintain a good pace for slightly longer than a cheetah's top sprint, but their absolute top speed is lower.

6.  **Formulate the conclusion based on the comparison:** The cheetah's physiological adaptations and documented speeds clearly indicate it is faster than a lion in terms of peak speed.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
