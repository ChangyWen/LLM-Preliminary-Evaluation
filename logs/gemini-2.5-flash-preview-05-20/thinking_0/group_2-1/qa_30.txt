Let's break down the reasoning process to determine if the average human lifespan is longer than that of a dog.

**Step 1: Understand the Question**
The core of the question is a comparison of average lifespans between two species: humans and dogs.

**Step 2: Recall/Research Average Human Lifespan**
*   General knowledge suggests humans live for many decades.
*   A quick mental check or search would confirm that the global average human lifespan is currently around **70-80 years** (with variations by country and gender).

**Step 3: Recall/Research Average Dog Lifespan**
*   General knowledge suggests dogs live for a significant number of years, but not as long as humans.
*   A quick mental check or search would confirm that the average dog lifespan is typically in the range of **10-13 years**.
*   It's important to note that dog lifespans vary significantly by breed (e.g., small breeds often live longer than giant breeds). However, we're looking for an *average*.

**Step 4: Compare the Averages**
*   Human average: 70-80 years
*   Dog average: 10-13 years

**Step 5: Draw a Conclusion**
Clearly, 70-80 years is a much longer period than 10-13 years.

**Step 6: Formulate the Final Answer**

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify Average Human Lifespan:** The average human lifespan globally is approximately 70-80 years, though this varies by country and other factors.
2.  **Identify Average Dog Lifespan:** The average dog lifespan is significantly shorter, typically ranging from 10 to 13 years, with considerable variation based on breed (smaller breeds generally live longer than larger breeds).
3.  **Compare the Two Averages:** When comparing 70-80 years to 10-13 years, the human lifespan is clearly much longer.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
