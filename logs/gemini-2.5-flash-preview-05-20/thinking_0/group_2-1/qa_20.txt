Let's break this down step-by-step to determine if the atomic number of oxygen is higher than that of carbon.

**Step 1: Understand "Atomic Number"**
The atomic number (Z) represents the number of protons in an atom's nucleus. This number uniquely identifies a chemical element and determines its position in the periodic table.

**Step 2: Locate Carbon (C) on the Periodic Table**
When you look at a standard periodic table, you'll find Carbon (C).
*   Its symbol is C.
*   The number typically displayed above the symbol (or sometimes below, but it's the whole number) is its atomic number.
*   For Carbon, the atomic number is **6**.

**Step 3: Locate Oxygen (O) on the Periodic Table**
Next, find Oxygen (O) on the periodic table.
*   Its symbol is O.
*   Similarly, the whole number associated with Oxygen is its atomic number.
*   For Oxygen, the atomic number is **8**.

**Step 4: Compare the Atomic Numbers**
*   Atomic number of Carbon (C) = 6
*   Atomic number of Oxygen (O) = 8

Comparing 8 to 6, we can clearly see that 8 is greater than 6.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
