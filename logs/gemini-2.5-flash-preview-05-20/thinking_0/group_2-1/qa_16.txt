Let's break down this question step-by-step to determine if the boiling point of water is higher than its freezing point.

**Step 1: Define Boiling Point**
The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a gas throughout the bulk of the liquid. For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere), this temperature is **100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit)**.

**Step 2: Define Freezing Point**
The freezing point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a solid. For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, this temperature is **0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit)**.

**Step 3: Compare the Temperatures**
Now, let's compare the two temperatures we've identified:
*   Boiling Point of Water = 100째C
*   Freezing Point of Water = 0째C

**Step 4: Determine if One is Higher Than the Other**
Is 100째C higher than 0째C? Yes, it is.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
