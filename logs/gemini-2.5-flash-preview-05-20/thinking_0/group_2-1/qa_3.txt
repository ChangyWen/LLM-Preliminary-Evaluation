Let's break down the reasoning process step-by-step to determine if Albert Einstein died later than Isaac Newton.

**Step 1: Determine the death date of Isaac Newton.**
*   A quick search reveals that Isaac Newton died on **March 31, 1727**.

**Step 2: Determine the death date of Albert Einstein.**
*   A quick search reveals that Albert Einstein died on **April 18, 1955**.

**Step 3: Compare the two death dates.**
*   Isaac Newton: 1727
*   Albert Einstein: 1955

**Step 4: Conclude which date is later.**
*   1955 is a later year than 1727.

**Step 5: Formulate the answer based on the comparison.**
*   Since Albert Einstein died in 1955 and Isaac Newton died in 1727, Albert Einstein died later than Isaac Newton.

**Final Answer:** Yes
