Let's break down the reasoning process to determine if the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand pH Scale:** The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14.
    *   pH < 7 indicates acidity.
    *   pH = 7 indicates neutrality.
    *   pH > 7 indicates alkalinity (basicity).
    *   A *lower* pH means *higher* acidity.

2.  **Identify the Nature of Water:** Pure water (H₂O) is considered neutral. It dissociates slightly into H⁺ (or H₃O⁺) and OH⁻ ions, but in equal concentrations, resulting in a pH of 7.

3.  **Identify the Nature of Lemon Juice:** Lemon juice is derived from lemons, which are citrus fruits. Citrus fruits are known for their sour taste. The sour taste is primarily due to the presence of **citric acid**.

4.  **Relate Acid to pH:** Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions (H⁺) when dissolved in water. An increase in H⁺ ion concentration leads to a decrease in pH.

5.  **Compare Acidity:**
    *   Water is neutral (pH = 7).
    *   Lemon juice contains citric acid, making it acidic.
    *   Since lemon juice is acidic, its pH must be less than 7.

6.  **Formulate the Comparison:** If water has a pH of 7 and lemon juice has a pH of less than 7, then the pH of lemon juice is indeed lower than that of water.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
