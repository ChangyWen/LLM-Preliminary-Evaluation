Let's break this down using a step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step 1: Identify the date of the first airplane flight.**
* The Wright brothers made their first successful flight on **December 17, 1903**.

**Step 2: Identify the date of the first moon landing.**
* The Apollo 11 mission, carrying Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, landed on the moon on **July 20, 1969**.

**Step 3: Compare the two dates.**
* 1903 (first airplane flight) comes before 1969 (first moon landing).

**Step 4: Formulate the conclusion based on the comparison.**
* Since 1903 is earlier than 1969, the first moon landing occurred *after* the first airplane flight.

**Final Answer:** Yes
