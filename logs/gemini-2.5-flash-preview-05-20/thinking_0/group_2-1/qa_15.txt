**************************************** Content ***************************************
Yes, the speed of light is significantly faster than the speed of sound. Here's a step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step 1: Understand What Light Is**
Light is an electromagnetic wave. It does not require a medium to travel and can propagate through a vacuum.

**Step 2: Understand What Sound Is**
Sound is a mechanical wave. It requires a medium (like air, water, or solids) to travel because it's caused by vibrations of particles within that medium. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum.

**Step 3: Consider the Nature of Their Propagation**

*   **Light:** Light travels by the oscillation of electric and magnetic fields. These oscillations can occur even in the absence of matter. In a vacuum, light travels at its maximum speed.
*   **Sound:** Sound travels by the collision and transfer of energy between particles. The speed of sound depends heavily on the properties of the medium it's traveling through (density, temperature, elasticity).

**Step 4: Recall or Look Up Their Typical Speeds**

*   **Speed of Light (c):** In a vacuum, the speed of light is approximately $299,792,458$ meters per second (m/s), often rounded to $3 \times 10^8$ m/s or $300,000$ kilometers per second (km/s).
*   **Speed of Sound (in air at room temperature):** In dry air at $20^\circ C$ ($68^\circ F$), the speed of sound is approximately $343$ meters per second (m/s).

**Step 5: Compare the Speeds**

*   Speed of Light: $\approx 300,000,000$ m/s
*   Speed of Sound: $\approx 343$ m/s

Clearly, $300,000,000$ is vastly greater than $343$.

**Step 6: Real-World Observations (Empirical Evidence)**

*   **Thunder and Lightning:** We see lightning (light) almost instantaneously, but we hear the thunder (sound) a noticeable time later, even though they originate from the same event. This delay demonstrates that light travels much faster than sound.
*   **Fireworks:** Similarly, we see the explosion of a firework before we hear its boom.
*   **Communication:** Radio waves (a form of electromagnetic radiation, like light) travel at the speed of light, allowing for near-instantaneous global communication, whereas sound would take a very long time to travel across continents.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
