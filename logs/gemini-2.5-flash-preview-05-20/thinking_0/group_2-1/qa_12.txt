Let's break down the timelines of these two empires to determine their chronological order.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Define the Roman Empire's Lifespan:**
    *   **Traditional Founding (Republic):** 509 BCE
    *   **Imperial Period (Augustus):** 27 BCE
    *   **Western Roman Empire Fall:** 476 CE
    *   **Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) Fall:** 1453 CE
    *   *For the purpose of general comparison, the period from 27 BCE to 476 CE (or even 1453 CE) is most relevant.*

2.  **Define the British Empire's Lifespan:**
    *   **Early Beginnings (Exploration/Colonies):** Late 16th Century (e.g., Roanoke 1585, Jamestown 1607)
    *   **Significant Expansion:** 18th and 19th Centuries
    *   **Peak:** Early 20th Century
    *   **Decline/End:** Mid to late 20th Century (e.g., India's independence 1947, Suez Crisis 1956, Hong Kong handover 1997).
    *   *The British Empire's most recognizable form and power existed roughly from the 17th century to the mid-20th century.*

3.  **Compare the Timelines:**
    *   **Roman Empire:** Primarily BCE to 5th Century CE (or 15th Century CE for the East).
    *   **British Empire:** Primarily 17th Century CE to 20th Century CE.

4.  **Identify Overlap or Precedence:**
    *   The Roman Empire's main period of existence (both Republic and Imperial) concluded *long before* the British Empire began to form and expand significantly.
    *   Even the very *earliest* stirrings of British overseas ventures (late 16th century) occurred over a thousand years after the fall of the Western Roman Empire and centuries after the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
