Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine if the Great Wall of China is longer than the Berlin Wall:

**Step 1: Identify the lengths of both structures.**

*   **Great Wall of China:** While there are varying estimates depending on what sections are included, the most widely accepted and comprehensive length for the Great Wall of China, including all its branches, is approximately **21,196 kilometers (13,171 miles)**. Even if we consider only the main, continuously built sections from the Ming Dynasty, it's still well over 6,000 kilometers.

*   **Berlin Wall:** The total length of the Berlin Wall, including the inner and outer walls and the border strip, was approximately **155 kilometers (96 miles)**.

**Step 2: Compare the two lengths.**

*   Great Wall of China: ~21,196 km
*   Berlin Wall: ~155 km

**Step 3: Determine which is longer.**

Comparing 21,196 km to 155 km, it is clear that 21,196 km is significantly greater than 155 km.

**Step 4: Formulate the final answer.**

The Great Wall of China is vastly longer than the Berlin Wall.

**Final Answer:** Yes
