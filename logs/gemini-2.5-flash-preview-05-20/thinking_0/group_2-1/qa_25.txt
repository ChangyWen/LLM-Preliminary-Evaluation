Let's break down the reasoning process to determine if the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is less than that on Earth.

**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Acceleration Due to Gravity**

Acceleration due to gravity (g) is the acceleration experienced by an object due to the gravitational force exerted by a celestial body (like Earth or the Moon). It's a measure of how strongly a planet or moon pulls objects towards its center.

**Step 2: Recall the Formula for Acceleration Due to Gravity**

The formula for acceleration due to gravity on the surface of a celestial body is:

$g = \frac{GM}{R^2}$

Where:
*   $G$ is the Universal Gravitational Constant (a constant value throughout the universe).
*   $M$ is the mass of the celestial body (e.g., mass of Earth, mass of the Moon).
*   $R$ is the radius of the celestial body.

**Step 3: Identify the Key Factors that Influence 'g'**

From the formula, we can see that 'g' is directly proportional to the mass (M) of the celestial body and inversely proportional to the square of its radius (R).

*   **Larger Mass (M) = Stronger Gravity (g)**
*   **Larger Radius (R) = Weaker Gravity (g)** (because the distance from the center is greater)

**Step 4: Gather Relevant Data for Earth and the Moon**

To compare 'g' for Earth and the Moon, we need to compare their masses and radii.

*   **Earth:**
    *   Mass ($M_{Earth}$) $\approx 5.97 \times 10^{24}$ kg
    *   Radius ($R_{Earth}$) $\approx 6.37 \times 10^6$ m

*   **Moon:**
    *   Mass ($M_{Moon}$) $\approx 7.35 \times 10^{22}$ kg
    *   Radius ($R_{Moon}$) $\approx 1.74 \times 10^6$ m

**Step 5: Compare the Masses and Radii**

*   **Mass Comparison:**
    *   $M_{Earth}$ is significantly greater than $M_{Moon}$. (Earth is about 81 times more massive than the Moon). This factor alone suggests Earth's gravity should be stronger.

*   **Radius Comparison:**
    *   $R_{Earth}$ is greater than $R_{Moon}$. (Earth's radius is about 3.6 times larger than the Moon's). A larger radius tends to *decrease* gravity, but it's the *square* of the radius in the denominator.

**Step 6: Qualitatively Analyze the Impact of Mass and Radius on 'g'**

*   **Effect of Mass:** The Moon has a much smaller mass than Earth. This will lead to a significantly smaller 'g' for the Moon.
*   **Effect of Radius:** The Moon has a smaller radius than Earth. A smaller radius would *increase* 'g' if mass were constant. However, the effect of the much smaller mass is dominant.

**Step 7: Perform a Quantitative Comparison (Optional but helpful for confirmation)**

Let's calculate the approximate ratio of $g_{Moon}$ to $g_{Earth}$:

$g_{Moon} / g_{Earth} = (G M_{Moon} / R_{Moon}^2) / (G M_{Earth} / R_{Earth}^2)$
$g_{Moon} / g_{Earth} = (M_{Moon} / M_{Earth}) \times (R_{Earth}^2 / R_{Moon}^2)$

Substitute the approximate values:

$g_{Moon} / g_{Earth} \approx (7.35 \times 10^{22} / 5.97 \times 10^{24}) \times ((6.37 \times 10^6)^2 / (1.74 \times 10^6)^2)$
$g_{Moon} / g_{Earth} \approx (0.0123) \times (40.58 \times 10^{12} / 3.03 \times 10^{12})$
$g_{Moon} / g_{Earth} \approx 0.0123 \times 13.4$
$g_{Moon} / g_{Earth} \approx 0.165$

This means $g_{Moon}$ is approximately 1/6th of $g_{Earth}$.

**Step 8: Formulate the Conclusion**

Since the Moon has significantly less mass and a smaller, but not proportionally smaller, radius compared to Earth, the dominant factor is its much smaller mass. This results in a weaker gravitational pull.

**Final Answer:**

Yes. The acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is less than that on Earth.
