Let's break down the reasoning process to determine if Japan is located east of China.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand the Question:** The core question is about the relative geographical positions of Japan and China, specifically if Japan is *east* of China.

2.  **Recall Basic Geography/Map Knowledge:**
    *   Imagine a standard world map.
    *   Recall the cardinal directions: North, South, East, West. East is typically to the right on a map.

3.  **Locate China on the Map (Mental or Actual):**
    *   China is a large country in East Asia. Its eastern coastline borders the Pacific Ocean.

4.  **Locate Japan on the Map (Mental or Actual):**
    *   Japan is an island nation.
    *   It is situated off the eastern coast of the Asian mainland.

5.  **Determine Relative Position:**
    *   If you start at China's eastern coast and move further *east* (to the right on the map), what do you encounter before hitting the open Pacific? You encounter the Sea of Japan/East Sea, the East China Sea, and then the islands of Japan.
    *   Therefore, to get from China to Japan, you generally travel in an easterly direction across a body of water.

6.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Based on this mental mapping and understanding of relative positions, Japan is indeed situated to the east of China.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
