Let's break down this question step-by-step to determine if the distance from Earth to the Sun is greater than the distance from Earth to the Moon.

**Step 1: Identify the key distances involved.**
*   Distance from Earth to the Sun (Astronomical Unit - AU)
*   Distance from Earth to the Moon (Lunar Distance - LD)

**Step 2: Recall or look up the approximate values for these distances.**

*   **Earth to Sun (Average):** This distance is defined as 1 Astronomical Unit (AU).
    *   1 AU is approximately 149.6 million kilometers (or about 93 million miles).

*   **Earth to Moon (Average):** This distance varies slightly due to the Moon's elliptical orbit, but on average:
    *   It's approximately 384,400 kilometers (or about 238,900 miles).

**Step 3: Compare the two values.**

*   Earth to Sun: ~149,600,000 km
*   Earth to Moon: ~384,400 km

**Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison.**

Clearly, 149,600,000 km is a much larger number than 384,400 km.

**Step 5: Formulate the final answer.**

Yes.

**Final Answer:** Yes
