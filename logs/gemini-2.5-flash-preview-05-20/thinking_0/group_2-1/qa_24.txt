Let's break down the concept of a "day" in this context and then compare Venus and Earth.

**Understanding "Day"**

When we talk about a "day" in the context of a planet, we usually mean one of two things:

1.  **Sidereal Day:** The time it takes for a planet to complete one full rotation on its axis relative to the distant stars. This is the planet's true rotational period.
2.  **Solar Day:** The time it takes for the Sun to appear in the same position in the sky (e.g., from one noon to the next). This is what we typically experience as a "day" on Earth. The solar day is influenced by both the planet's rotation and its orbital motion around its star.

For the purpose of comparing the *length* of a day, the **solar day** is usually what people are implicitly asking about, as it dictates the cycle of light and darkness. However, the **sidereal day** is crucial for understanding the planet's fundamental rotation.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

**1. Determine the Sidereal Day for Venus:**
    *   Venus rotates extremely slowly and in a retrograde (backward) direction compared to most planets.
    *   Its sidereal rotation period is approximately **243 Earth days**.

**2. Determine the Orbital Period for Venus:**
    *   Venus orbits the Sun much faster than Earth.
    *   Its orbital period (the time it takes to complete one revolution around the Sun) is approximately **225 Earth days**.

**3. Calculate the Solar Day for Venus:**
    *   Because Venus rotates so slowly *and* in the opposite direction to its orbit, its solar day is significantly shorter than its sidereal day.
    *   Imagine standing on Venus. As Venus rotates backward, it's also moving forward in its orbit. This combination means the Sun appears to move across the sky relatively quickly.
    *   The formula for the solar day (D_solar) when rotation (P_rot) and orbit (P_orb) are in opposite directions is: 1/D_solar = 1/P_rot - 1/P_orb (or more accurately, 1/D_solar = |1/P_rot - 1/P_orb| if you consider the direction).
    *   A simpler way to think about it: The Sun moves across the sky due to the combination of the planet's rotation and its orbital motion. On Venus, these two motions are in opposition.
    *   The solar day on Venus is approximately **117 Earth days**.

**4. Determine the Solar Day for Earth:**
    *   Earth's sidereal day is approximately 23 hours and 56 minutes.
    *   Earth's orbital period is approximately 365.25 days.
    *   Earth's solar day is approximately **24 hours (1 Earth day)**.

**5. Compare the Solar Days:**
    *   Venus's solar day: ~117 Earth days
    *   Earth's solar day: ~1 Earth day

**6. Compare the Sidereal Days:**
    *   Venus's sidereal day: ~243 Earth days
    *   Earth's sidereal day: ~0.997 Earth days (approx. 23 hours 56 minutes)

**Conclusion based on Solar Day (the common understanding of "day"):**

A day on Venus (solar day) is approximately 117 Earth days long.
A day on Earth (solar day) is approximately 1 Earth day long.

Therefore, a day on Venus lasts much longer than a day on Earth.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
