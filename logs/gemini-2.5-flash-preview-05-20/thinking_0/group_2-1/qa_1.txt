Let's break down the comparison between a blue whale and an elephant in terms of weight.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the Animals:** We are comparing a blue whale and an elephant.

2.  **Recall/Research Typical Weights:**
    *   **Elephant:** Elephants are the largest land animals. Their weight varies by species and individual, but a typical adult African elephant (the largest) can weigh between 4,000 kg and 6,000 kg (4 to 6 metric tons). Some exceptionally large ones might reach 7,000 kg.
    *   **Blue Whale:** Blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, both in terms of length and weight. Their weight also varies, but a typical adult blue whale can weigh between 100,000 kg and 200,000 kg (100 to 200 metric tons). Some sources even cite up to 180-190 metric tons.

3.  **Convert to a Common Unit (if necessary):** Both are already in kilograms or metric tons, which are easily comparable. Let's use metric tons for simplicity.
    *   Elephant: 4-7 metric tons
    *   Blue Whale: 100-200 metric tons

4.  **Compare the Ranges:**
    *   Minimum blue whale weight (100 metric tons) is significantly higher than the maximum elephant weight (7 metric tons).
    *   Maximum blue whale weight (200 metric tons) is vastly higher than the maximum elephant weight (7 metric tons).

5.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Based on the typical weight ranges, a blue whale is considerably heavier than an elephant. To put it in perspective, a blue whale can weigh as much as 15 to 30 elephants!

**Final Answer:**

Yes
