Let's break down the comparison between the Sahara Desert and the Gobi Desert in terms of temperature.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify Key Characteristics of Each Desert:**

    *   **Sahara Desert:**
        *   **Location:** North Africa, straddling the Tropic of Cancer.
        *   **Climate Type:** Subtropical hot desert (Köppen climate classification: BWh).
        *   **Dominant Features:** Vast sand dunes (ergs), rocky plateaus (hamadas), gravel plains (regs).
        *   **Temperature Drivers:** High solar insolation due to low latitude, clear skies, dry air, lack of vegetation.
        *   **Seasonal Variation:** Relatively consistent high temperatures year-round, with extreme heat in summer. Winters are mild to warm.

    *   **Gobi Desert:**
        *   **Location:** Central Asia, primarily Mongolia and China.
        *   **Climate Type:** Cold desert (Köppen climate classification: BWk).
        *   **Dominant Features:** Rocky terrain, gravel plains, salt pans, some sand dunes. It's not primarily a sandy desert like the Sahara.
        *   **Temperature Drivers:** High latitude (further from the equator), continental interior location (far from moderating ocean influences), high elevation in many parts.
        *   **Seasonal Variation:** Extreme temperature swings between seasons. Very hot summers, but *extremely cold* winters.

2.  **Compare Temperature Extremes (Summer):**

    *   **Sahara:** Known for some of the highest recorded air temperatures on Earth. Daytime summer temperatures routinely exceed 40°C (104°F) and can reach well over 50°C (122°F) in places like Death Valley (which shares similar climate characteristics with parts of the Sahara). Ground temperatures can be even higher.
    *   **Gobi:** Summers can be hot, with daytime temperatures often reaching 30-40°C (86-104°F). However, the *peak* summer temperatures generally do not reach the same extreme highs as the Sahara.

3.  **Compare Temperature Extremes (Winter):**

    *   **Sahara:** Winters are generally mild to warm, with average daytime temperatures still comfortable, often above 15-20°C (59-68°F). Nighttime temperatures can drop, but rarely below freezing for extended periods in most areas.
    *   **Gobi:** Winters are *brutally cold*. Temperatures frequently drop to -20°C (-4°F) and can plummet to -40°C (-40°F) or lower, with significant snowfall. This is a defining characteristic of a "cold desert."

4.  **Consider "Hotter" in Context:**

    *   If "hotter" refers to the *highest absolute temperatures ever recorded* or the *average summer daytime temperatures*, the Sahara clearly wins.
    *   If "hotter" refers to the *average annual temperature*, the Sahara would still be warmer because its winters are significantly milder, offsetting the Gobi's hot summers.
    *   If "hotter" implies a *lack of cold*, the Sahara is definitively hotter.

5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** The Sahara's low latitude, consistent high solar insolation, and lack of moderating influences lead to consistently higher temperatures year-round, especially during its peak summer. While the Gobi can have hot summers, its high latitude and continental nature result in extremely cold winters, making its overall temperature profile much colder than the Sahara's.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
