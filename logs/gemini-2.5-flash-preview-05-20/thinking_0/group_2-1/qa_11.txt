Let's break down the comparison of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans step-by-step.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question is a direct comparison of the *size* (specifically surface area and volume) of two major oceans.

2.  **Recall/Research Basic Oceanographic Facts:**
    *   The Earth has five major oceans: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic.
    *   These oceans are not equal in size.

3.  **Focus on the Pacific Ocean:**
    *   What are its general characteristics? It's known for being the largest and deepest ocean.
    *   Its boundaries are vast, stretching from the Arctic to the Southern Ocean, and from Asia/Australia to the Americas.

4.  **Focus on the Atlantic Ocean:**
    *   What are its general characteristics? It's known for being the second largest ocean.
    *   Its boundaries are also significant, separating Europe/Africa from the Americas.

5.  **Direct Comparison (Mental or Actual Data Retrieval):**
    *   **Pacific Ocean:**
        *   Surface Area: Approximately 165.25 million square kilometers (63.8 million sq mi)
        *   Volume: Approximately 669.88 million cubic kilometers (160.7 million cu mi)
        *   Covers about 30% of the Earth's surface and 46% of its water surface.
    *   **Atlantic Ocean:**
        *   Surface Area: Approximately 106.46 million square kilometers (41.1 million sq mi)
        *   Volume: Approximately 310.41 million cubic kilometers (74.4 million cu mi)
        *   Covers about 20% of the Earth's surface and 26% of its water surface.

6.  **Analyze the Data:**
    *   165.25 million sq km (Pacific) is clearly greater than 106.46 million sq km (Atlantic).
    *   669.88 million cubic km (Pacific) is clearly greater than 310.41 million cubic km (Atlantic).

7.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Based on both surface area and volume, the Pacific Ocean is significantly larger than the Atlantic Ocean.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
