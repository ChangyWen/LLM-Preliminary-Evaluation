Let's break down the comparison between Mount Everest and K2.

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the key characteristic for comparison:** The question asks about "taller," which refers to the **elevation above sea level**.

2.  **Recall/Research the elevation of Mount Everest:**
    *   Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world.
    *   Its official elevation is **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)** above sea level.

3.  **Recall/Research the elevation of K2:**
    *   K2 (also known as Mount Godwin Austen or Chogori) is the second-highest mountain in the world.
    *   Its official elevation is **8,611 meters (28,251 feet)** above sea level.

4.  **Compare the two elevations:**
    *   8,848.86 meters (Everest) vs. 8,611 meters (K2)

5.  **Determine which is greater:** 8,848.86 is greater than 8,611.
