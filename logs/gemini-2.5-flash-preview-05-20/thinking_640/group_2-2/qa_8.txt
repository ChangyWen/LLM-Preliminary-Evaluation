Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I need to figure out if the Gobi Desert is hotter than the Sahara. Right, so first, I break down the prompt. It wants a step-by-step explanation *and* a definitive yes or no answer. Easy enough.

Next, I start pulling information from memory. Sahara: Africa, scorching heat, sand. Gobi: Asia, cold winters, rockier terrain, maybe a bit less intense heat overall? "Hotter" is the key here. That means I'm comparing average temperatures, probably focusing on the summer months.

My gut says "No, the Sahara is hotter." I'm basing that on the Gobi's reputation for those brutal, bone-chilling winters. The Sahara, from what I recall, is consistently baking.

So, time to back that up. Okay, location: Sahara's in North Africa, right near the Tropic of Cancer, a low latitude. Gobi is way up in Central Asia, much higher latitude. That alone points to different climates. Sahara: subtropical hot desert. Think high pressure, clear skies, intense sun. Gobi: cold winter desert, continental climate, extreme temperature swings.

I need to look at the temperature data. Sahara: some of the highest recorded temperatures on Earth, consistently high summer highs. Gobi: hot summers, yes, but those winters! Way below freezing. That's going to pull the average down significantly. Both are deserts, so rainfall isn't going to make a big difference. And yeah, the Sahara's sand dunes will probably heat up very fast, while the Gobi is more rocky/gravelly, but that is still absorbing a lot of sun.

So, summing up... "hotter" mostly concerns average or peak summer temps, and those brutally cold Gobi winters are the clincher. I'm confident in my conclusion.

Let's break down the comparison between the Gobi Desert and the Sahara Desert regarding temperature.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Location and Latitude:**
    *   **Sahara Desert:** Located in North Africa, it spans a wide area, largely within the subtropical high-pressure belt, and straddles the Tropic of Cancer. This low latitude means it receives very direct and intense solar radiation year-round.
    *   **Gobi Desert:** Located in Central Asia (Mongolia and China), it is situated at a much higher latitude (around 40-50°N). This higher latitude means it experiences more distinct seasons and less direct solar radiation on average compared to the Sahara.

2.  **Climate Type:**
    *   **Sahara Desert:** Classified primarily as a **subtropical hot desert**. Its climate is dominated by stable high-pressure systems, leading to clear skies, minimal cloud cover, and intense solar heating.
    *   **Gobi Desert:** Classified as a **cold winter desert** or **temperate desert**. It experiences a continental climate, characterized by extreme temperature variations between seasons.

3.  **Temperature Extremes and Averages:**
    *   **Sahara Desert:**
        *   **Summer:** Experiences consistently extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 40°C (104°F) and frequently reaching 50°C (122°F) or more in many areas. It holds records for some of the highest air temperatures ever recorded on Earth.
        *   **Winter:** While nights can be cool, daytime temperatures remain warm to mild, rarely dropping below freezing for extended periods.
        *   **Overall:** The average annual temperature is significantly higher due to consistently hot conditions.
    *   **Gobi Desert:**
        *   **Summer:** Can have hot days, with temperatures sometimes reaching 35-40°C (95-104°F).
        *   **Winter:** Experiences brutally cold winters, with temperatures frequently dropping to -20°C (-4°F) and even as low as -40°C (-40°F). Snowfall is common.
        *   **Overall:** While summer days can be hot, the extremely cold winters drastically lower the average annual temperature. The temperature range (difference between summer high and winter low) is much greater than in the Sahara.

4.  **Defining "Hotter":** When we say "hotter," we generally refer to higher average temperatures, especially during the warmest periods. The Sahara consistently maintains higher temperatures across the year and reaches more extreme highs during its peak season.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the geographical location, climate type, and temperature data, the Sahara Desert experiences significantly higher average temperatures and more extreme heat, particularly during its summer months, compared to the Gobi Desert. While the Gobi can have hot summer days, its extremely cold winters make its overall climate much cooler than the Sahara's.

**Final Answer:** No
