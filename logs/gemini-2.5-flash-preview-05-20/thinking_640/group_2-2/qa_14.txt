*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this elephant versus blue whale heart size question. First, I have to break down the request. I need a step-by-step explanation, a clear 'Yes' or 'No' answer, and the rationale behind it. Simple enough.

Immediately, I'm already pulling up the basics from memory. An elephant is a large land animal, but the blue whale is *massive*.  It's the largest animal on the planet.  My intuition tells me the whale's heart is going to dwarf the elephant's.  Body size and heart size are fundamentally linked; it’s pretty much a given.

So, my initial hypothesis is that the elephant's heart will not be larger. The blue whale's heart will be substantially bigger, no question.

Now, to back it up, I'll start drawing on my existing knowledge and quickly mentally access the key data points.  An African elephant is, what, 4 to 6 tons, maybe a bit more?  Then the blue whale… a hundred to two hundred tons is typical, sometimes even more!  And I already know the general rule of thumb – the heart's weight relative to body mass is in the ballpark of half a percent to a percent in mammals.

I'm also mentally cataloging known facts.  I recall seeing descriptions of blue whale hearts being the size of a small car, a Volkswagen Beetle, say.  And the weight... I believe the figures are around 400 to 600 kilograms.  The aorta is large enough for a human to move through. Fascinating!

Then, for the elephant, I recall a heart of around 12 to 21 kilograms, something like that, with a general size comparable to a large watermelon or basketball.

Okay, time to compare the data. The blue whale’s heart weighs roughly 400-600 kg, and the elephant's heart is a mere 12-21 kg.

The comparison itself is trivial. Quantitatively, it's a huge difference. Qualitatively... the size of a small car versus the size of a watermelon. The answer is plainly obvious.

Now for the step-by-step articulation:

**Step 1: Establish the Scale of the Animals.** We have a clear difference in size.  Blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, topping out at up to 200 tons. Elephants, while impressive land mammals, reach only up to 6-7 tons. The blue whale is dramatically larger.

**Step 2: Body Size and Heart Size.**
...and so on, through the subsequent steps.

Let's break down the comparison of heart sizes between an elephant and a blue whale.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Compare Overall Body Size:**
    *   **Blue Whale:** The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest animal on Earth, both in terms of length and mass. An adult blue whale can weigh anywhere from 100 to 200 tons (200,000 to 400,000 pounds).
    *   **Elephant:** The African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) is the largest land animal. An adult male can weigh up to 6-7 tons (12,000 to 14,000 pounds).
    *   **Conclusion:** A blue whale is *significantly* larger than an elephant, by a factor of roughly 15 to 30 times in terms of mass.

2.  **Understand the General Principle of Heart Size:**
    *   In mammals, heart size generally scales with body mass. Larger animals typically have larger hearts to pump blood throughout their much larger bodies and maintain their metabolic needs. While the exact proportion can vary slightly between species, a much larger animal will almost invariably have a much larger heart.

3.  **Compare Actual Heart Sizes (Based on Scientific Data):**
    *   **Blue Whale Heart:** The heart of a blue whale is the largest of any animal. It can weigh between 400 to 600 kilograms (approximately 900 to 1,300 pounds). Its aorta (the main artery) is so large that a human child could crawl through it, and its ventricles are often described as being the size of a small car (like a Volkswagen Beetle or a golf cart).
    *   **Elephant Heart:** The heart of an African elephant typically weighs between 12 to 21 kilograms (approximately 26 to 46 pounds). It's roughly the size of a large watermelon or a basketball.

4.  **Direct Comparison:**
    *   Blue Whale Heart: ~400-600 kg
    *   Elephant Heart: ~12-21 kg
    *   The blue whale's heart is approximately 20 to 50 times heavier than an elephant's heart.

**Final Answer:**

No.
