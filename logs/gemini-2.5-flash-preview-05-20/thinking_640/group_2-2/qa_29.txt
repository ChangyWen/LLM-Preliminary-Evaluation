*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here’s how I'd approach this question. First, I need to be clear on the *actual* question: does blue light have a *longer* wavelength than red light? Simple enough. We need a definitive answer, and the reasoning needs to be crystal clear.

Now, to answer this like a pro, it’s all about fundamental principles. Light, that’s easy, it's electromagnetic radiation. Its core properties, well, those are wavelength (lambda), frequency (f), and the speed of light (c). And we know, fundamentally, that *c* = lambda * *f*. Got it. ROYGBIV! That's the key – the visible spectrum.

Next, it’s all about connecting the dots: color to wavelength, frequency, and energy. The order, ROYGBIV, is the key. Red… and then, where's blue in that scheme of things? Going from Red to Violet, the wavelength *decreases*. So, red must be at the "long wavelength" end, and blue, somewhere in between.

Now for the frequency and energy. Given *c* is constant, if the wavelength decreases, the frequency *must* increase. And energy is directly proportional to frequency, as we know, with *E* = *hf*.

Therefore, red light has a *longer* wavelength than blue light.

Finally, I'd lay out the answer like this:

*   **Step 1:** Define that visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and comprises many different colors.
*   **Step 2:** Explain each color is tied to a specific range of wavelengths.
*   **Step 3:** Emphasize that Red is found at the "long wavelength" end, and therefore, red has a longer wavelength than blue.

Let's break down the properties of visible light.

**Step-by-step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understanding the Visible Spectrum:** Visible light is a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can perceive. It's composed of different colors, each corresponding to a specific range of wavelengths.
2.  **Order of Colors by Wavelength:** The colors of the visible spectrum are commonly remembered by the acronym ROYGBIV:
    *   **R**ed
    *   **O**range
    *   **Y**ellow
    *   **G**reen
    *   **B**lue
    *   **I**ndigo
    *   **V**iolet
    This order represents a progression from the longest wavelengths (Red) to the shortest wavelengths (Violet).
3.  **Comparing Red and Blue Light:**
    *   Red light is at the "long wavelength" end of the visible spectrum. Its approximate wavelength range is 620-750 nanometers (nm).
    *   Blue light is closer to the "short wavelength" end of the visible spectrum. Its approximate wavelength range is 450-495 nanometers (nm).
4.  **Conclusion:** Since red light has a wavelength range of approximately 620-750 nm and blue light has a range of approximately 450-495 nm, the wavelength of blue light is shorter than that of red light.

**Final Answer:**

No.
