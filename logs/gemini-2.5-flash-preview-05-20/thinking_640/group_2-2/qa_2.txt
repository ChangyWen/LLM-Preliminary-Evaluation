*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this question, "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?":

First, I need to break down the request. The prompt is asking for two key things: a reasoned, step-by-step explanation and a definitive "Yes" or "No" answer. Clear enough.

My immediate reaction is to go straight to the facts. I *know* Everest is the highest peak globally. I also know K2 is the second-highest. It's a basic piece of geographic knowledge, so I'll lean on my existing understanding here. Based on that, I can already tell you the answer is "No."

But I need to present the *reasoning*. Let me lay it out in a structured way:

*   **Step 1: Everest's Status:** I'll start by stating the obvious, which is that Mount Everest is the highest mountain on the planet, with an elevation around 8,848 meters.
*   **Step 2: K2's Status:** Next, I'll clarify that K2 is the second-highest and provide its elevation, roughly 8,611 meters.
*   **Step 3: Comparison:** Now, the real comparison. I'll explicitly compare the two elevations: 8,848.86 meters (Everest) versus 8,611 meters (K2).
*   **Step 4: Conclusion:**  It's a simple mathematical fact – 8,848.86 is greater than 8,611. Therefore, K2 is not taller.

Finally, I'll consolidate it all together: combine that step-by-step reasoning with the answer – and I'm done.  Easy.

Let's break down the comparison between K2 and Mount Everest.

**Step-by-step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify Mount Everest's Elevation:** Mount Everest is officially recognized as the highest mountain in the world. Its summit is approximately **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)** above sea level.
2.  **Identify K2's Elevation:** K2 (also known as Mount Godwin Austen or Chogori) is the second-highest mountain in the world. Its summit is approximately **8,611 meters (28,251 feet)** above sea level.
3.  **Compare the Elevations:**
    *   Mount Everest: 8,848.86 meters
    *   K2: 8,611 meters
    *   Comparing these two figures, 8,848.86 meters is greater than 8,611 meters.
4.  **Conclusion:** Since Mount Everest's elevation is higher than K2's elevation, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.

**Final Answer:**

No
