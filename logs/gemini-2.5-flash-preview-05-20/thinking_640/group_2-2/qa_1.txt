*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's my thought process for this question. First, I break down the prompt. "Is an elephant heavier than a blue whale?" It's straightforward, but it's not *just* the answer I need, but the justification. Okay, so I need to explain the 'why' behind my answer.

Right off the bat, I know this is a size comparison. My initial thought is: a blue whale *has* to be heavier. These things are colossal, the largest animal on Earth, right? Elephants, even the biggest African bulls, are impressive, but… no contest.

Now, I need to quantify this. I'm not just going with intuition; I need data. Elephant weights: Hmm, the usual range is… 6 to 7 metric tons for the average adult African elephant, sometimes pushing 10 tons. Got it. Blue whale: Definitely much heavier. I recall it being between 100 and 200 tons, potentially even more for exceptional individuals. Okay, let's stick with the conservative ranges.

Okay, now for the actual comparison. Elephant: roughly 6-10 tons. Blue Whale: roughly 100-200 tons. The difference is *significant*. No doubt about it.

So, to structure my response for the user, here's the plan: I'll start by identifying the two subjects. Then, I'll present the weight ranges for each, drawing on my existing knowledge and backing it up with specifics. Then, I'll directly compare the ranges, making the disparity explicit. Finally, I'll make my conclusion. It's a clear argument, backed by data.

Let's break down the weights of these magnificent animals:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the animals:** We are comparing an elephant and a blue whale.
2.  **Determine typical adult weight for an elephant:**
    *   An adult African elephant (the largest land animal) typically weighs between 6,000 kg (6 metric tons) and 7,000 kg (7 metric tons). Very large males can sometimes exceed 10,000 kg (10 metric tons).
3.  **Determine typical adult weight for a blue whale:**
    *   An adult blue whale (the largest animal on Earth, both currently and in recorded history) typically weighs between 100,000 kg (100 metric tons) and 200,000 kg (200 metric tons). Some exceptionally large individuals have been recorded even heavier.
4.  **Compare the weights:**
    *   Elephant: ~6-10 metric tons
    *   Blue Whale: ~100-200 metric tons
    *   The blue whale is, on average, 10 to 30 times heavier than an elephant.

**Final Answer:**

No.
