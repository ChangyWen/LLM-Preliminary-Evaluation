*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this question, thinking it through step-by-step.

Right off the bat, I'm pretty sure the answer is "No." My mental map of the world, honed from years of working with geographical data, tells me that Russia is *massive*, and Australia, while large, isn't quite that big. But, let's not rely on gut feeling alone; we need to be rigorous.

First, I'll break down the process. The question is a simple comparison of land areas, so my core task is: provide the area of Australia, the area of Russia, compare them, and then give a "Yes" or "No" answer. That’s how I would explain my reasoning and keep it transparent.

I'm going to pull those area figures from my internal knowledge base, based on what I routinely use, but I'll immediately double-check the specific figures to guarantee accuracy. Australia is usually cited around 7.7 million square kilometers. Russia? That's over 17 million, easily the largest country in the world.

Okay, let's get the precise numbers. I know Wikipedia or the CIA World Factbook will have them, but I'm going to recall them from my memory and then verify. I'm pretty sure Australia is roughly 7,692,024 square kilometers, but I'll confirm the values. I'm also confident Russia is around 17,098,246 square kilometers.

Now, the comparison. Seventeen million is clearly way bigger than seven million. Easy.

So, the answer is "No." Australia is not larger than Russia.

To deliver the answer clearly, I'll present the facts like this:
First the "No" answer for immediate clarity.
Then I'll lay out the reasoning: Here are the areas of each country. Here is the comparison.
Finally, restate the conclusion: Australia is smaller than Russia.

No.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Determine the area of Australia:** The total land area of Australia is approximately **7,692,024 square kilometers (or about 2,969,907 square miles)**.
2.  **Determine the area of Russia:** The total land area of Russia is approximately **17,098,246 square kilometers (or about 6,601,670 square miles)**.
3.  **Compare the two areas:**
    *   Russia: 17,098,246 km²
    *   Australia: 7,692,024 km²
    As you can see, 17,098,246 is significantly larger than 7,692,024.

**Final Answer:** No.
