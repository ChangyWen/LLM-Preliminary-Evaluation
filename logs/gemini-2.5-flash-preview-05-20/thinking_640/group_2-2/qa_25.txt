*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this question about Earth's and the Moon's gravity.

First things first, I see this is a *comparison* problem – we're looking at *relative* acceleration due to gravity. Right away, I'm thinking about the equation: $g = GM/R^2$.  G is a constant, so it's all about mass and radius.

My mental checklist starts ticking: I need to compare the $g$ values for Earth and the Moon, so I'm going to consider $M$ and $R$ for each. Then I'll have to compare.

Right, so I need some data. Earth’s mass, let’s say roughly $6 \times 10^{24}$ kg, and the moon, about $7 \times 10^{22}$ kg. Huge difference in mass, with the Earth having significantly more. Probably, around 80 times more massive, right?  Then, the radius... Earth's radius is around $6.4 \times 10^6$ meters, and the Moon’s is about $1.7 \times 10^6$ meters. Earth's bigger there too, maybe a little less than 4 times the radius.

Okay, so now the analysis.  $g$ goes up with $M$, so a bigger mass means a bigger $g$.  $g$ goes *down* with $R^2$, so a larger radius means a smaller $g$. The key is: which effect wins? Earth's got vastly more mass, but also a bigger radius. That mass difference is huge, something like 80 times the mass of the moon. Radius, only about 3.5 times the moon's radius.  But it's *radius squared* that matters in the equation! So, the radius is only about 13 times bigger.

Clearly, the mass difference is going to dominate. My gut says Earth's gravity will be much stronger.

But to be absolutely sure...  I could quickly do a rough calculation. Using approximate values, I'd get a $g$ of roughly 9.8 m/s² for Earth and around 1.6 m/s² for the Moon. Yup. The Earth’s is, as expected, a lot bigger.

Let's break down the reasoning process step-by-step.

**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Acceleration Due to Gravity (g)**
The acceleration due to gravity ($g$) on the surface of a celestial body is determined by its mass and its radius. The formula for $g$ is:

$g = \frac{GM}{R^2}$

Where:
*   $G$ is the Universal Gravitational Constant (a constant value everywhere in the universe).
*   $M$ is the mass of the celestial body.
*   $R$ is the radius of the celestial body (distance from its center to its surface).

**Step 2: Gather Relevant Data for Earth and the Moon**

*   **Universal Gravitational Constant (G):** Approximately $6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N m}^2/\text{kg}^2$ (This value is the same for both Earth and the Moon).

*   **Earth:**
    *   Mass of Earth ($M_E$): Approximately $5.972 \times 10^{24} \text{ kg}$
    *   Radius of Earth ($R_E$): Approximately $6.371 \times 10^6 \text{ m}$

*   **Moon:**
    *   Mass of Moon ($M_M$): Approximately $7.342 \times 10^{22} \text{ kg}$
    *   Radius of Moon ($R_M$): Approximately $1.737 \times 10^6 \text{ m}$

**Step 3: Compare the Key Factors (Mass and Radius)**

*   **Mass Comparison:**
    *   Earth's mass ($5.972 \times 10^{24} \text{ kg}$) is significantly greater than the Moon's mass ($7.342 \times 10^{22} \text{ kg}$).
    *   Specifically, Earth's mass is about 81 times greater than the Moon's mass ($5.972 \times 10^{24} / 7.342 \times 10^{22} \approx 81.3$).
    *   Since $g$ is directly proportional to $M$, a larger mass tends to increase $g$.

*   **Radius Comparison:**
    *   Earth's radius ($6.371 \times 10^6 \text{ m}$) is also greater than the Moon's radius ($1.737 \times 10^6 \text{ m}$).
    *   Specifically, Earth's radius is about 3.67 times greater than the Moon's radius ($6.371 \times 10^6 / 1.737 \times 10^6 \approx 3.67$).
    *   Since $g$ is inversely proportional to $R^2$, a larger radius tends to decrease $g$.

**Step 4: Calculate or Estimate the Acceleration Due to Gravity for Each Body**

*   **For Earth ($g_E$):**
    $g_E = \frac{(6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N m}^2/\text{kg}^2) \times (5.972 \times 10^{24} \text{ kg})}{(6.371 \times 10^6 \text{ m})^2}$
    $g_E \approx 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$

*   **For the Moon ($g_M$):**
    $g_M = \frac{(6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N m}^2/\text{kg}^2) \times (7.342 \times 10^{22} \text{ kg})}{(1.737 \times 10^6 \text{ m})^2}$
    $g_M \approx 1.62 \text{ m/s}^2$

**Step 5: Compare the Calculated Values**

*   $g_E \approx 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$
*   $g_M \approx 1.62 \text{ m/s}^2$

Clearly, $9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$ is much greater than $1.62 \text{ m/s}^2$.

**Step 6: Formulate the Conclusion**

The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is significantly *greater* than that on the Moon. While Earth's larger radius would, by itself, reduce gravity, its overwhelmingly larger mass (81 times the Moon's mass) dominates this effect, resulting in a much stronger gravitational pull.

**Final Answer:**

No. The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is **greater** than that on the Moon.
