Alright, here's how I'd approach this question, "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?"

First things first, I break down the core of the question: it's a comparison of *death dates* – specifically, whether Newton's death occurred *after* Einstein's. That means I need those two crucial data points: death dates.

My brain already knows that both are major figures in science, but I need those specific years. Newton, 17th/18th century... a quick mental recall, or if I needed it, a quick search, would confirm his death date. *Yep*, March 31, 1727. Einstein, 20th century… definitely later. Okay, I need that exact date. Confirmed: April 18, 1955.

Now for the comparison. Newton in 1727. Einstein in 1955. Simple math here. 1955 is definitely later than 1727. 

So, back to the specific question: “Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?” Let's lay it out: Newton died in 1727, Einstein in 1955. Since 1727 is *before* 1955, Newton didn't die later.

Therefore, the answer is a clear *no*. The reasoning is straightforward: Einstein's death date of 1955 is later than Newton's 1727 death date.

Let's break this down:

1.  **Find Isaac Newton's death date:** Isaac Newton died on **March 31, 1727**.
2.  **Find Albert Einstein's death date:** Albert Einstein died on **April 18, 1955**.
3.  **Compare the dates:**
    *   1727 (Newton's death)
    *   1955 (Einstein's death)

Since 1727 is *earlier* than 1955, Isaac Newton died *before* Albert Einstein.

**Final Answer:** No.
