*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here’s how I'd approach this question: "Is the boiling point of water lower than the melting point of ice?"

First, I need to break down the question. Essentially, it's a comparison problem, asking if a specific temperature is less than another. I'll need to provide a clear, step-by-step explanation to justify my answer. A simple "yes" or "no" isn't enough; I need to demonstrate my understanding of the underlying principles.

Next, I need to recall the fundamental definitions and values. I immediately know the boiling point of water at standard pressure is 100°C (or 212°F), and the melting point of ice at standard pressure is 0°C (or 32°F). Of course, these values are understood to be under standard atmospheric conditions, something I need to implicitly acknowledge. Pressure significantly impacts phase transitions, but in this context, we're dealing with standard conditions.

Now for the crucial comparison. I need to ask myself: Is 100°C lower than 0°C? Obviously, no. I will then methodically construct my reasoning.

Here’s the logical flow I'd present:

*   **Step 1:** The boiling point of water is 100°C.
*   **Step 2:** The melting point of ice is 0°C.
*   **Step 3:** 100°C is higher than 0°C.
*   **Step 4:** Therefore, the boiling point of water is not lower than the melting point of ice.

Finally, I'd deliver a concise "No" answer to the original question, clearly stating my conclusion.

Before finalizing, I will check my answer. Did I use clear and precise language? Yes. Are the values correct? Absolutely. Did I provide a direct and focused answer to the initial question? Indeed. Is the reasoning logical and easy to follow? Yes, it's straightforward. Did I include the required "Yes/No" answer? Affirmative. Good to go.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the boiling point of water:** At standard atmospheric pressure, water boils at **100 degrees Celsius (100°C)**, or 212 degrees Fahrenheit (212°F). This is the temperature at which liquid water turns into steam.
2.  **Identify the melting point of ice:** At standard atmospheric pressure, ice melts at **0 degrees Celsius (0°C)**, or 32 degrees Fahrenheit (32°F). This is the temperature at which solid ice turns into liquid water.
3.  **Compare the two temperatures:** We need to compare 100°C (boiling point) with 0°C (melting point).
4.  **Determine if the boiling point is lower:** 100°C is clearly much higher than 0°C. Therefore, the boiling point of water is *not* lower than the melting point of ice; it is significantly higher.

**Final Answer:**

No.
