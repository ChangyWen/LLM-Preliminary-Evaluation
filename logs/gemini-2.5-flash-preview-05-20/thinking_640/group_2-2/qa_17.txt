*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here’s how I'd approach this question: "Does Mars have more moons than the Earth?".

First, I break down the prompt. I see the core question, the demand for a detailed explanation, and the required yes/no answer. No problem.

Then, I pull up my knowledge base. I immediately recall that Earth has one moon, *the* Moon, of course. And I'm pretty sure Mars has two. Now, to verify that: I know there's Phobos and Deimos.

Easy enough; now I do a simple comparison: Earth has one moon, Mars has two. Two is obviously greater than one.

Now I need to construct a clear, step-by-step breakdown, which is key to explaining my reasoning.

*   **Step 1:** Earth’s moon count: one. Pretty fundamental.
*   **Step 2:** Mars' moon count: two; Phobos and Deimos.
*   **Step 3:** Comparison: Two is greater than one. Straightforward.

Finally, I can confidently state my conclusion. Based on the number of moons around each planet, the answer to "Does Mars have more moons than Earth?" is emphatically "Yes."

I review my work; the steps are clear, the answer is correct, and my facts are accurate. This systematic method is pretty much second nature.

Let's break down the number of moons for each planet:

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Determine the number of moons for Earth:** Earth has **1** natural satellite, commonly known as "the Moon."
2.  **Determine the number of moons for Mars:** Mars has **2** natural satellites, named Phobos and Deimos.
3.  **Compare the numbers:** We compare 2 (Mars's moons) with 1 (Earth's moons).

Since 2 is greater than 1, Mars has more moons than Earth.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
