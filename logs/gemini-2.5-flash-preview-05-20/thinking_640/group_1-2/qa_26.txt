*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'm going to approach this. The question is whether a specific Oregon ZIP code (97233) is west of a Washington ZIP code (98580).

First, I need to be crystal clear on what "west of" actually *means* in a geographic context.  That boils down to longitudes.  I know that on a standard map, the further west you go, the *more negative* the longitude becomes.

So, my next step is to get the longitude coordinates for both ZIP codes. I'll quickly look up the longitude for 97233 in Oregon. Portland, Oregon is the location for that ZIP code, and I can quickly ascertain that its longitude is approximately -122.58° W.

Next, I'll do the same for 98580 in Washington, which is Shelton.  The longitude for Shelton is approximately -123.10° W.

Now the crucial comparison. I know that the ZIP code further west will have the *smaller* (i.e., more negative) longitude. Looking at the numbers, 97233 has a longitude of -122.58° and 98580 has a longitude of -123.10°. Therefore, 97233 is *east* of 98580.

To be absolutely clear, I'll lay out my steps:

1.  Get the longitude for 97233, OR.
2.  Get the longitude for 98580, WA.
3.  Compare the longitudes: The smaller (more negative) longitude is further west.

To determine if 97233, OR is located west of 98580, WA, we need to compare their longitudes. Locations further west have a more negative (or larger absolute value of West) longitude.

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Find the approximate longitude for 97233, OR:**
    *   97233 is a ZIP code in Portland, Oregon.
    *   Its approximate longitude is **-122.58° W**.

2.  **Find the approximate longitude for 98580, WA:**
    *   98580 is a ZIP code in Shelton, Washington.
    *   Its approximate longitude is **-123.10° W**.

3.  **Compare the longitudes:**
    *   Longitude of 97233, OR: -122.58°
    *   Longitude of 98580, WA: -123.10°

    *   On a standard coordinate system, a location is "west of" another if its longitude value is *more negative* (i.e., further to the left on the number line).
    *   Comparing -122.58 and -123.10:
        *   -123.10 is a smaller (more negative) number than -122.58.
        *   This means 98580, WA is further west than 97233, OR.
        *   Conversely, 97233, OR is *east* of 98580, WA.

**Final Answer:**

No.
