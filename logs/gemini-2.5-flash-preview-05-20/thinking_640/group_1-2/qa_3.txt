*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this question, breaking it down step-by-step.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. The core is a comparison: was *Gold* released *after* *Nightmare Honeymoon*?  My output needs to be a clear "Yes" or "No," along with the reasoning.

Next, I know the key pieces of information needed are the release dates for each film.  Let's see, what comes next?

Now, time to formulate the search queries. Mentally or, if necessary, I'd do this physically.  I'd start with "Gold Peter R. Hunt release date," then "Nightmare Honeymoon Elliot Silverstein release date."

Let's simulate the retrieval process. I'd know instantly that *Gold*, directed by Peter R. Hunt, came out in 1974, and that *Nightmare Honeymoon* was released in 1974 as well. Ah, I can quickly recall that *Gold* had its UK release in August 1974 and the US release was in September. *Nightmare Honeymoon* had a US premiere in March of that same year.

Right, time for the comparison.  *Gold* (August/September 1974) versus *Nightmare Honeymoon* (March 1974).

The question is "Was *Gold* released *later*?"... Well, August/September is clearly later than March.  Easy.

Now, to provide the step-by-step reasoning. I'd first identify the full title and director of each film. Then, find the release date for *Gold*. Then, find the release date for *Nightmare Honeymoon*. Then compare them. Lastly, based on that comparison, I'd make a conclusion.

Therefore, the answer is "Yes."

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Identify the release date of Peter R. Hunt's *Gold*:**
    *   *Gold* (1974 film) was released in August 1974 (UK) and September 1974 (US).

2.  **Identify the release date of Elliot Silverstein's *Nightmare Honeymoon*:**
    *   *Nightmare Honeymoon* (also known as *Deadly Honeymoon*) was released in March 1974 (US).

3.  **Compare the release dates:**
    *   *Gold*: August/September 1974
    *   *Nightmare Honeymoon*: March 1974

    Since August/September 1974 comes after March 1974, *Gold* was indeed released later than *Nightmare Honeymoon*.

**Final Answer:** Yes
