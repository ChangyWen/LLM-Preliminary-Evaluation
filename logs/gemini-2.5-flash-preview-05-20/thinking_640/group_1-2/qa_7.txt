*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's my thought process. First, I break down the question: I need to determine if William II, Count of Chalon, lived longer than Anastasia of Sirmium, and provide my reasoning. Straightforward enough.

Next, I identify the core information needed: the birth and death dates for both individuals. Time to go through my mental database of knowledge and search. Since I don't have that at my immediate disposal, I'll *simulate* how I would find the information.

First, I'd search for "William II Count of Chalon dates." My research would likely lead me to Wikipedia or genealogical databases. Based on my expert knowledge, I would expect to quickly find his birth around 1168 and death in 1202.

Then, I'd search "Anastasia of Sirmium dates." I'm expecting to find her through sources on Serbian or Byzantine medieval history; she was, if memory serves, a wife of a Serbian ruler. I anticipate her birth around 1244, and death around 1300.

With the data gathered, I now process and compare it. William II was born around 1168 and died in 1202, giving him an approximate lifespan of 34 years. Anastasia, born around 1244 and dying in 1300, lived roughly 56 years.

Instantly, I can see that William II died well before Anastasia was even born. Furthermore, Anastasia's calculated lifespan is significantly longer.

Now, I formulate my reasoning. I'll present the birth and death dates for each person, calculate their approximate lifespans, and then compare those spans directly.

Finally, the answer. Based on these lifespans, Anastasia lived longer. Thus, the final answer is No, William II did *not* live longer than Anastasia. The answer directly addresses the question and is a simple yes/no answer, just as requested. I'm satisfied with this conclusion.
