*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this. The user wants to know if Schiller International University in Florida is north of the University of Tampa. Simple enough, but precision is key.

First, I need to be absolutely certain what "Schiller International University, FL" refers to.  My understanding is that their primary US campus in Florida is in Largo. I'll check if there is another relevant campus, but for now, I'll proceed assuming Largo.

To determine north/south position, I'll need geographical coordinates. Specifically, latitude is my go-to metric. I'll search for the addresses of each institution, then find their respective latitudes.  My search process will look something like this: I'll search for "Schiller International University Florida campus address" (or something similar) and then "University of Tampa address" to get those starting points.

Next, I'll focus on finding the latitude and longitude for those addresses. I'll use search terms like "Latitude longitude Largo FL" (targeting the Schiller campus) and "Latitude longitude University of Tampa."

I'm anticipating that the data will give me something like this: Schiller in Largo around 27.90° N latitude and The University of Tampa around 27.94° N.

Once I have these numbers, it's a straightforward comparison.  Higher latitude indicates a location is further north.  I'll directly compare the latitudes.  Since the University of Tampa's latitude will be higher, it will be north of Schiller.

Finally, I'll construct a clear answer, detailing the addresses used, the approximate latitudes, the principle of latitude-based north/south comparison, and the specific comparison of the latitudes, confirming the position.  My conclusion will explicitly state "No," Schiller International University is *not* north of the University of Tampa.
