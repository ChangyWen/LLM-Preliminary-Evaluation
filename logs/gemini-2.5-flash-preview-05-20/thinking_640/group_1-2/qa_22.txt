*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's my thought process for this spatial reasoning problem. First, I need to break down the prompt: it's asking if the Dal-Tex Building in Texas is south of Lake Martin in Alabama. And they want the step-by-step logic. Got it.

So, to figure this out, I know I'm going to have to compare the latitudes of the two locations. A location with a lower latitude is further south. Makes sense. So step one, I need to identify the key locations: The Dal-Tex Building, and Lake Martin.

Now I need to get the information. I know "TX" is Texas, and I'm pretty sure the Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, so I need to find the latitude of Dallas, Texas. Easy enough, a quick search for "Dallas TX latitude" or "Dal-Tex Building Dallas TX coordinates" will give me that. Then, I need the latitude of Lake Martin, Alabama. I'll search "Lake Martin AL latitude" or something similar.

I already kind of know this, but confirming it, Dallas, Texas is around 32.78 degrees North latitude, and Lake Martin, Alabama is around 32.75 degrees North latitude.

Now I have to compare these latitudes. Dallas is at a *higher* latitude, therefore, it's *further north* than Lake Martin.  The question is asking if Dallas is south of Lake Martin. Since Dallas is north of Lake Martin, the answer is "No."

Finally, I’ll write out the steps.

*   Step 1: Determine the location of the Dal-Tex Building. (Dallas, TX)
*   Step 2: Find the approximate latitude of the Dal-Tex Building (Dallas, TX).
*   Step 3: Find the approximate latitude of Lake Martin, AL.
*   Step 4: Compare the latitudes.
*   Step 5: Determine which location is further north/south based on the latitude comparison.
*   Step 6: Answer the question: "No."

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1.  **Identify the first location and its coordinates:**
    *   The Dal-Tex Building is located in Dallas, Texas.
    *   The approximate latitude of Dallas, Texas (and thus the Dal-Tex Building) is **32.7767° N**.

2.  **Identify the second location and its coordinates:**
    *   Lake Martin is located in Alabama.
    *   The approximate latitude of Lake Martin, Alabama is **32.75° N**.

3.  **Compare the latitudes:**
    *   Dal-Tex Building (Dallas, TX): 32.7767° N
    *   Lake Martin, AL: 32.75° N

4.  **Determine the relative position:**
    *   A higher North latitude means the location is further north.
    *   Since 32.7767° N (Dal-Tex Building) is greater than 32.75° N (Lake Martin), the Dal-Tex Building is located *north* of Lake Martin.

5.  **Answer the question:**
    *   The question asks: "Is Dal-Tex Building, TX located south of Lake Martin, AL?"
    *   Based on the comparison, the Dal-Tex Building is *north* of Lake Martin, not south.

**Final Answer:**

No
