*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here’s how I'd tackle this. First, I’d break down the question, making sure I understand what's actually being asked: was Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under" released before Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James"? The answer needs to be a clear yes or no, supported by my reasoning.

To get there, I'll need to nail down the key pieces of information: the release dates of both songs. That means a quick trip through my mental archives. I know "Pull Me Under" comes from *Images and Words*. Aha! That album dropped on July 7, 1992. And as a single, "Pull Me Under" likely came out around the same time or a bit beforehand to promote the album.

Next, Beastie Boys. "Jimmy James" is on *Ill Communication*. That was released on May 23, 1994. It wasn’t a *primary* single, but it's an album track. So, its release is essentially aligned with the album’s date.

Now for the simple comparison: July 7, 1992, versus May 23, 1994. Easy. July '92 definitely comes before May '94.

So, my step-by-step reasoning will look something like this: First, find the release date of "Pull Me Under." Second, find the release date of "Jimmy James." Third, compare them. And finally, the answer to the question? Yes. Perfect. I've got my answer, it's logically sound, and it's ready to go.
