*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd tackle this. The user wants to know which of these two historical figures was born first, and they want a clear, reasoned answer. So, here's my thought process:

First, I need to pinpoint the core task: Determine which individual was born earlier. This means I need their birth dates. Simple enough.

Next, I formulate my search strategy. I'd mentally or actually initiate a quick search - I'm already picturing the queries in my head: "Alfonso of Molina birth year" and "Yao Shu birth year." It's just straight-forward historical research.

Now, for the "search execution" phase. I'd anticipate finding Alfonso's birth year relatively easily. I immediately recall him being an infante of Leon and Castile and a son of Alfonso IX. A quick check - which I am, in effect, doing in my head right now - will confirm his birth year as 1202. His death year isn't relevant for the core question, but I might jot it down for context.

Moving on, Yao Shu. My knowledge of Yuan Dynasty history is solid, so I know he was a scholar-official who served Kublai Khan. Again, I'd pull up his birth year using the same search method. My mind already seems to tell me it was 1201, which I'll want to confirm. And the dates are right there: 1201.

Next, I'll do a simple comparison. 1202 versus 1201. Okay, it's clear Yao Shu came first.

The question is *specifically* if Alfonso was born earlier. Given the information, I know that’s a 'no'

Now, to organize my thoughts for presentation. I'll structure the answer methodically:
1.  Find Alfonso’s birth year.
2.  Find Yao Shu's birth year.
3.  Compare the birth years.
4.  Draw a definitive conclusion.

And the final answer, to align with the question: No, Alfonso of Molina was *not* born earlier than Yao Shu. It was the other way around. All good.

Let's determine the birth years of both individuals:

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1.  **Find the birth year of Alfonso of Molina:** Historical records indicate that Alfonso of Molina was born in **1202**.
2.  **Find the birth year of Yao Shu:** Historical records indicate that Yao Shu was born in **1201**.
3.  **Compare the birth years:**
    *   Alfonso of Molina: 1202
    *   Yao Shu: 1201
    Since 1201 is earlier than 1202, Yao Shu was born earlier than Alfonso of Molina.

**Final Answer:**

No.
