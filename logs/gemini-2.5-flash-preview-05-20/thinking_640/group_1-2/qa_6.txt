*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know which article came out first, specifically if "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained" was published before "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal." Simple enough, a clear question.

To nail this, I'll need the publication dates for both articles. So, step one is figuring out where to look for those. My immediate strategy is the tried and true: a quick search using the article titles. I'm assuming these are news articles, and I know the New York Times is a likely source. I'll start there.

Okay, let's go through this. First, "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained." Looks like that's a New York Times piece on Navalny. A quick search confirms and I find the date: **July 18, 2013.**

Next, "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal." Right, another New York Times article. And the date: **July 18, 2011.**

Now for the crucial comparison. Article 1: July 18, 2013. Article 2: July 18, 2011.

So, is July 18, 2013, earlier than July 18, 2011? No. July 18, 2011, came first.

To be crystal clear in my conclusion, Iâ€™ll state the dates and then the comparison.

Therefore, the answer is **No**.
