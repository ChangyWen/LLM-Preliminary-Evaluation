*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'm approaching this. First, I need to break down the question: "Is Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO located east of Sangre de Cristo Range, CO?" and provide my reasoning, with a final "Yes" or "No" answer.

My initial thought is that "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" *is* the "Sangre de Cristo Range." I'm pretty sure they're used interchangeably, meaning something can't be east of itself. So, the answer *should* be "No," but I can't just assume. I need to be certain.

So, my strategy is to define both terms and compare them geographically. First, I'll need to figure out the precise definition of "Sangre de Cristo Range," and then "Sangre de Cristo Mountains." I'll then compare their spatial extents. Are they the same thing, or is one a part of the other?

I'd start with a quick search for "Sangre de Cristo Range Colorado" â€“ probably getting a description of the mountain range extending from Colorado into New Mexico, forming the eastern border of the San Luis Valley. Then, a search for "Sangre de Cristo Mountains Colorado" should come up with a description of what I already thought: often used to refer to the *same* range.

I'll need to check if there's a *distinct* geographical entity called "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" within the broader range. Usually, quick searches like a map search or the USGS GNIS database will show that "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" is just referring to the overall range. If that's the case, then the answer is definitely "No," because a feature can't be east of itself. That's the logical conclusion I will ultimately draw.

Let's break this down:

**Step-by-step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Define "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO":** The Sangre de Cristo Range is a major mountain range in the Southern Rocky Mountains. It extends from Poncha Pass in south-central Colorado southwards into northern New Mexico. It forms the eastern wall of the San Luis Valley.

2.  **Define "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO":** The term "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" is generally used interchangeably with "Sangre de Cristo Range" to refer to the *entire* mountain range described above. There isn't a distinct, separate geographical feature *within* Colorado specifically named "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" that is separate from and located east of the broader "Sangre de Cristo Range."

3.  **Analyze the Spatial Relationship:** If "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" refers to the same geographical entity as "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO," then one cannot be located "east of" the other. A geographical feature cannot be located east of itself.

**Final Answer:**

No
