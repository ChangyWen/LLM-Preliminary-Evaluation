*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'm going to tackle this. First, I need to determine if William de Warenne, the 1st Earl of Surrey, died *later* than Agnes of Aquitaine, the Countess of Savoy. The core of this is comparing their death dates.

Okay, step one is to identify who we are talking about. I need to find both people and their death dates. Now, I'll use my knowledge and experience to rapidly pinpoint these dates. My preferred method is a quick search using a reliable resource – let's use the readily available historical data and cross-reference, or a genealogical database if needed.

Let's get the dates: William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey – "William de Warenne 1st Earl of Surrey death date" - common knowledge says 1088. And Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy – "Agnes of Aquitaine Countess of Savoy death date" - 1159. Sometimes she's listed as Agnes of Poitou, but the "Countess of Savoy" part confirms the correct person.

Now for the comparison: William died in 1088, Agnes in 1159. Is 1088 *later* than 1159? No, 1088 is earlier.

Therefore, my answer must be based on a clear comparison of these two dates. It's a straightforward chronological assessment. No ambiguity.

I will double check that I've got the correct individuals. There could be more than one person with each name, but the Earl of Surrey and the Countess of Savoy are clear identifiers. Also, the dates I have seem to fit what I already know about these historical figures.

And that's my answer: No.
