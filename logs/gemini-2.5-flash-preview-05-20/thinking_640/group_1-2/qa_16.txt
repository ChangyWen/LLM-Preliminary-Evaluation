*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this. First, I need to understand what the user wants – they're essentially asking a geographical question: is Sheboygan, Wisconsin, located west of the Ort Institute in Illinois? I need to give a definitive "Yes" or "No" answer, and crucially, I need to explain *why*.

My thought process starts by zeroing in on the crucial pieces of information I need. To determine "west," I'll need the longitudes of both locations. That means I need to find the latitude and longitude for both the University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan and the Ort Institute. I'll probably use a mapping service – Google Maps is usually my go-to, or sometimes I prefer OpenStreetMap for its data richness.

Right, let's get the coordinates. A quick search for "University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI" should do it. Okay, Google Maps pops up with the address and, more importantly, the coordinates. It says roughly 43.759° N, 87.719° W. The longitude, 87.719° W, is what matters for this question. That's my key data point for Sheboygan.

Next, "The Ort Institute, IL". I'll search for that. Ah, Google Maps finds it in Skokie, Illinois: 3701 W Howard St, Skokie, IL 60076. The coordinates are around 42.019° N, 87.731° W. Again, the longitude is key: 87.731° W.

Now the comparison. I need to remember what "west" *means* in terms of longitude. Higher West longitudes are more west. So, I'm comparing the two longitudes: 87.719° W (Sheboygan) and 87.731° W (Ort Institute).

Is 87.719° W *west* of 87.731° W? No. Since 87.719 is a smaller number than 87.731, Sheboygan is actually *east* of the Ort Institute. Therefore, the answer is "No."

To determine if University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI is located west of The Ort Institute, IL, we need to compare their longitudes. A location is west of another if its longitude value (when both are in West longitudes) is numerically greater.

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Find the geographical coordinates (specifically longitude) for University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI:**
    *   Location: 1 University Dr, Sheboygan, WI 53081
    *   Approximate Longitude: **87.719° W**

2.  **Find the geographical coordinates (specifically longitude) for The Ort Institute, IL:**
    *   Location: 3701 W Howard St, Skokie, IL 60076 (often referred to as ORT Technical Institute or ORT College)
    *   Approximate Longitude: **87.731° W**

3.  **Compare the longitudes:**
    *   UW-Sheboygan: 87.719° W
    *   The Ort Institute: 87.731° W

4.  **Determine relative position:**
    *   When comparing West longitudes, a numerically *larger* value indicates a location further west.
    *   In this case, 87.731 is numerically larger than 87.719. This means The Ort Institute (87.731° W) is further west than UW-Sheboygan (87.719° W).
    *   Therefore, University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is located *east* of The Ort Institute.

**Final Answer:**

No
