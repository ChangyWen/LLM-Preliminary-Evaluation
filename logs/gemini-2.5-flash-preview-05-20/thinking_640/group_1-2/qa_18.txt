*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here’s my thought process on this. I need to figure out if Cattaraugus County, NY, is west of Cambria County, PA. Simple enough, it's a "yes" or "no" question.

First, I need to decide on my approach. This is a geographic problem, so my strategy will be to determine the approximate longitude of each county. The more negative the longitude, the further west it is. It's really all about the longitude values.

Now, I need to gather the necessary information. Let's see, Cattaraugus County... I picture Western New York, right near the Pennsylvania border. I know New York is generally east of Pennsylvania, but *specifically*, Cattaraugus is in the westernmost part of New York. It's south of Buffalo and west of Allegany County. Its western border is near the 79th meridian west.

Next, Cambria County, PA. I'm picturing central-western Pennsylvania, Johnstown is a major city there. It's east of Pittsburgh and west of Harrisburg, but how does it stack up with Cattaraugus?

With that general context in mind, let's refine this with more precise data. Let's quickly estimate the center longitudes or bounding box longitudes of both counties. I can work from memory here, or I'd do a quick check to confirm.

For Cattaraugus County, NY, the westernmost point looks to be around 79.18° W, and the easternmost point is near 78.20° W. So, the approximate center is around 78.7° W.

For Cambria County, PA, I'd guess its westernmost point is around 79.18° W, with an easternmost point of ~78.50° W, placing its center around 78.8° W.

Finally, analyze those longitudes. 78.7° W for Cattaraugus, and 78.8° W for Cambria. Considering their westernmost points are nearly identical and the fact that Cattaraugus' easternmost point is west of Cambria's easternmost point, I'm confident in the answer.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Identify the Geographic Location of Each County:**
    *   **Cattaraugus County, New York:** This county is located in the southwestern part of New York State, bordering Pennsylvania. It's generally considered part of Western New York. Its western boundary is very close to the 79th meridian west, and it extends eastward.
    *   **Cambria County, Pennsylvania:** This county is located in the west-central part of Pennsylvania. Johnstown is its largest city. Its western boundary is also very close to the 79th meridian west, and it extends eastward.

2.  **Determine "West of":** To be "west of" another location means having a longitude that is further to the west (a higher negative value or a larger number when expressed as degrees West).

3.  **Compare Longitudes:**
    *   **Cattaraugus County, NY:** Its approximate longitudinal range is from about **79.18° W** (western edge) to **78.20° W** (eastern edge).
    *   **Cambria County, PA:** Its approximate longitudinal range is from about **79.18° W** (western edge) to **78.50° W** (eastern edge).

4.  **Analyze the Overlap/Relationship:**
    *   Both counties share a very similar westernmost longitude (around 79.18° W).
    *   Cattaraugus County, NY, extends further east (to ~78.20° W) than Cambria County, PA (which extends to ~78.50° W).
    *   Crucially, a significant portion of Cambria County, PA, lies *east* of the westernmost parts of Cattaraugus County, NY. While their western edges align, Cattaraugus County does not lie entirely to the west of Cambria County. In fact, they are largely aligned north-south, with Cattaraugus County being directly north of some counties that are west of Cambria County (like Warren County, PA, which is directly west of McKean County, PA, which is north of Elk County, PA, which is west of Cambria County, PA).

    *   To be "west of" means the *entirety* or at least the *majority* of the first location is to the west of the second. In this case, they are more or less on the same north-south longitudinal band, with Cattaraugus County actually extending *further east* than Cambria County.

**Final Answer:**

No.
