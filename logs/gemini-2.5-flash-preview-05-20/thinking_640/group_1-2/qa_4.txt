*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this question, breaking it down step-by-step.

First, I immediately recognize the core issue: the prompt asks about "Williamsburg, Manhattan." That's the red flag. Williamsburg is *in Brooklyn*, not Manhattan. So, any geographical comparison built on that premise is inherently problematic.

My mental map kicks in. Hillman Houses – Lower East Side, Manhattan. I know it well. And Williamsburg… it’s across the East River, in Brooklyn.

Therefore, the critical piece of information to relay is the factual error. The question's framework is flawed from the start.

Now, even with the inherent problem, I can *hypothetically* answer the 'south of' question.  If, and it's a big *if*, there were an imaginary "Williamsburg, Manhattan" roughly in the same position as the actual Williamsburg (across the river from the Lower East Side), then, yes, Hillman Houses *would* be geographically south of it.

But it's crucial to state the obvious, which is the inaccurate initial premise.

Therefore, my step-by-step response would go something like this:

1.  **Location Identification:**  Hillman Houses are in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Williamsburg is in Brooklyn.  This is the critical piece of factual information.
2.  **Address the Premise:** The question is predicated on the false assumption that Williamsburg is in Manhattan. This must be corrected immediately.
3.  **Geographical context:**  Even with the correction, I can explain the relative positioning. Hillman Houses are in Manhattan, and Williamsburg is directly across the East River from the Lower East Side.
4.  **Relative location:**  To make a north/south determination from Hillman Houses would involve drawing a line directly east across the East River, which would lead one to the area of Williamsburg.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1.  **Identify Hillman Houses:** Hillman Houses is a housing cooperative located in the **Lower East Side of Manhattan**. This is a downtown area of Manhattan.

2.  **Identify Williamsburg:** Williamsburg is a large neighborhood located in the borough of **Brooklyn**, New York City. It is *not* in Manhattan.

3.  **Address the Premise:** The question states "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan." This premise is incorrect. Williamsburg is in Brooklyn.

4.  **Determine Relative Location (if we consider the actual Williamsburg in Brooklyn relative to Hillman Houses in Manhattan):**
    *   Hillman Houses is on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
    *   Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is located directly across the East River from the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
    *   If you were to look at a map, Williamsburg (Brooklyn) is generally **north-northeast** of Hillman Houses (Manhattan), across the East River. It is certainly not south.

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Locate Hillman Houses:** Hillman Houses is situated in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
2.  **Locate Williamsburg:** Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The premise of "Williamsburg, Manhattan" is geographically inaccurate.
3.  **Compare Actual Locations:** Even if we disregard the "Manhattan" part of Williamsburg in the question and consider the actual Williamsburg (Brooklyn) relative to Hillman Houses (Manhattan), Williamsburg is located across the East River to the east/northeast of the Lower East Side.
4.  **Determine North/South Relationship:** Based on their actual geographical positions, Williamsburg (Brooklyn) is situated to the north/northeast of Hillman Houses (Manhattan), not south.

**Final Answer:**

No.
