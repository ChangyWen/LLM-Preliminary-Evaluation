*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here’s how I'm going to approach this. First, I need to figure out if a specific church in Nevada is east of a dam in California. This seems straightforward enough – it's a classic geographical comparison.

My plan is to get the coordinates, specifically the longitude, for both locations. Longitude is what dictates East/West positioning. A more negative longitude indicates a more westward location. I'll find the coordinates, compare the longitudes, and that will tell me the answer.

First, let's get the coordinates for St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church in Nevada. A quick search for its location should do the trick. Aha, Virginia City, NV. And the address, just to make absolutely sure. Now, I’ll plug that into a mapping tool or a geocoding service to get the latitude and, crucially, the longitude. Okay, I've got it: approximately -119.650° West.

Now, Pine Flat Dam in California. Same process: a quick search for the location, and it looks like Fresno County, on the Kings River. Let's get the coordinates. Right, longitude: -119.330° West.

Time for the comparison. Remember, we're looking at the longitude. St. Mary's is at -119.650°, and Pine Flat Dam is at -119.330°. -119.330 is *greater than* -119.650. Therefore, Pine Flat Dam is further east.

The question is if the church is east of the dam. Since the dam is east of the church, the answer is no.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relative locations:

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the two locations:**
    *   Location A: St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV
    *   Location B: Pine Flat Dam, CA

2.  **Find the geographical coordinates (specifically longitude, as we are comparing East/West position) for each location.**

    *   **For St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV:**
        *   A quick search reveals this church is located in Virginia City, Nevada.
        *   Using a mapping service (like Google Maps) for "St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, Virginia City, NV", the approximate coordinates are:
            *   Latitude: 39.306° N
            *   **Longitude: -119.650° W**

    *   **For Pine Flat Dam, CA:**
        *   A quick search reveals this dam is located in Fresno County, California, on the Kings River.
        *   Using a mapping service for "Pine Flat Dam, CA", the approximate coordinates are:
            *   Latitude: 36.860° N
            *   **Longitude: -119.330° W**

3.  **Compare the longitudes:**
    *   St. Mary's Longitude: -119.650° W
    *   Pine Flat Dam Longitude: -119.330° W

    *   In the Western Hemisphere (where longitudes are negative), a longitude value that is *less negative* (closer to 0) is further East. A longitude value that is *more negative* (further from 0) is further West.

    *   Comparing -119.650 and -119.330:
        *   -119.330 is greater than -119.650.
        *   Therefore, Pine Flat Dam is located East of St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church.

4.  **Answer the question based on the comparison:**
    *   The question asks: "Is St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV located east of Pine Flat Dam, CA?"
    *   Our comparison shows that St. Mary's (-119.650° W) is *west* of Pine Flat Dam (-119.330° W).

**Final Answer:**

No
