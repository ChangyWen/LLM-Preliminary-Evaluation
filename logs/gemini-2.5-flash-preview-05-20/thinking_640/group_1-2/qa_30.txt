*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'm tackling this. First, I break down the question: "Is Lake Vico west of Pragser Wildsee? Show your work, then give a Yes/No answer." Easy enough. The core of the problem is figuring out the relative east-west positions of these two lakes.

My brain automatically flags the key elements: Lake Vico and Pragser Wildsee (aka Lago di Braies). To compare their "west of" positions, I *need* their locations, ideally their coordinates. I start reaching into my mental geographical database.

I know Lake Vico is in Lazio, Italy – north of Rome, near the Apennines. My rough estimate is around 42.3° N, 12.1° E. Pragser Wildsee, on the other hand, I know well. It's in South Tyrol, in the Dolomites, right near the Austrian border, around 46.6° N, 12.1° E.

Now, a quick comparison. "Hmm, they're both roughly on the same longitude, around 12.1° E." That means one isn't definitively *west* of the other in the usual way. But wait a second... is one *slightly* west? I need to be precise, so I'm going to double-check those coordinates to be absolutely sure. I'll quickly look those up, just to be certain.

Okay, a fast coordinate check confirms: Lake Vico is ~12.17° E, and Pragser Wildsee is ~12.08° E. To be "west of," Lake Vico's longitude *must* be smaller than Pragser Wildsee's longitude. That's the final test.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Identify Lake Vico's Location:**
    *   Lake Vico is located in the Lazio region of central Italy.
    *   Its approximate geographical coordinates are around **42.33° N, 12.17° E**.

2.  **Identify Pragser Wildsee's Location:**
    *   Pragser Wildsee (also known as Lago di Braies) is located in South Tyrol, in the Dolomites of northern Italy.
    *   Its approximate geographical coordinates are around **46.69° N, 12.08° E**.

3.  **Compare Longitudes:**
    *   To determine if Lake Vico is *west* of Pragser Wildsee, we need to compare their longitudes. A location is west of another if its longitude value is *smaller* (further west on the globe).
    *   Lake Vico's longitude: 12.17° E
    *   Pragser Wildsee's longitude: 12.08° E

4.  **Analyze the Comparison:**
    *   12.17° E (Lake Vico) is *greater than* 12.08° E (Pragser Wildsee).
    *   This means Lake Vico is actually slightly *east* of Pragser Wildsee, not west. Pragser Wildsee is slightly west of Lake Vico.

**Final Answer:** No
