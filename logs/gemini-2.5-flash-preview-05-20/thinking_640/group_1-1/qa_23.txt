*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'm going to approach this. First, I need to figure out if Pine Flat Dam in California is east of a church in Nevada. Seems straightforward, but it requires a precise understanding of what "east of" means in a geographical context. Essentially, I'm looking for the location with the *smaller* (less negative) longitude.

So, step one, and this is the core of the problem-solving: I need to pinpoint the key locations – Pine Flat Dam and St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church. Next, I'll zero in on their longitudes. I'm planning to use a mapping service like Google Maps; they're usually reliable and accurate. I'll search for each location individually and note down the latitude and longitude coordinates.

Now for the execution. I searched for "Pine Flat Dam, CA" and, as expected, I got its coordinates: Latitude 36.8608° N, Longitude 119.3108° W. West is negative, so I can mentally note -119.3108° for the longitude.

Next, "St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV." To make sure I get the right place, I'll probably add "Virginia City" to the search. Ah yes, Google Maps gives us: Latitude 39.3069° N, Longitude 119.6508° W. Again, I know this is -119.6508° for its longitude.

Now for the comparison. Pine Flat Dam's longitude is -119.3108°, and St. Mary's is -119.6508°. Now I'm checking if -119.3108° is greater than -119.6508°. Yes, it is!

To present this clearly, I'll outline the steps: First, I identified the coordinates for Pine Flat Dam. Second, I identified the coordinates for the church. Third, I compared the longitudes. It's a simple geographic problem, really.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the Coordinates for Pine Flat Dam, CA:**
    *   Using a reliable mapping service (like Google Maps), we find the approximate coordinates for Pine Flat Dam, CA.
    *   **Pine Flat Dam, CA:**
        *   Latitude: 36.8608° N
        *   Longitude: 119.3108° W

2.  **Identify the Coordinates for St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV:**
    *   Using a reliable mapping service, we find the approximate coordinates for St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV (located in Virginia City, NV).
    *   **St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV:**
        *   Latitude: 39.3069° N
        *   Longitude: 119.6508° W

3.  **Compare the Longitudes:**
    *   To determine if one location is "east of" another, we compare their longitudes. A location further east will have a longitude value closer to 0° or a less negative (or more positive) value when expressed as West longitudes.
    *   Pine Flat Dam Longitude: 119.3108° W
    *   St. Mary's in the Mountains Longitude: 119.6508° W

4.  **Determine Relative Position:**
    *   When comparing West longitudes, the smaller the number (closer to 0°), the further east the location is.
    *   119.3108° W is a smaller number (closer to 0°) than 119.6508° W.
    *   Therefore, Pine Flat Dam is located to the east of St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
