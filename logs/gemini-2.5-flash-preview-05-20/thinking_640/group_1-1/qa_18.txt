*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'm approaching this. The question is straightforward: is Cambria County, PA west of Cattaraugus County, NY? I need to provide a clear "Yes" or "No" answer and explain my reasoning.

First, I need to break down the question. I have two counties and a spatial relationship to determine. The best way to solve this is through a geographic approach: locating them relative to each other.

So, Step 1: I visualize Pennsylvania. Cambria County is in the southwestern part of central PA, around Johnstown. That's my base.

Next, Step 2: I picture New York. Cattaraugus County is in the southwest of NY, bordering Pennsylvania. Think Olean or Salamanca.

Step 3: Now I compare. If I imagine a north-south line, Cattaraugus is southwest NY, and Cambria is west-central PA.  If I trace a line *east* from Cambria, I *eventually* cross the longitude of Cattaraugus, and then hit Cattaraugus itself, as it's further north. Therefore, Cambria County *is* west of Cattaraugus County.

Just to be absolutely sure, I'll refine it mentally. Pennsylvania's western border is Ohio; New York's is Lake Erie and Pennsylvania. Cattaraugus is in NY's southwest corner. Cambria is definitely east of Ohio, but in the western portion of PA. Consider some key cities for a gut check: Pittsburgh, Johnstown, Buffalo, Olean. Moving east from Pittsburgh to Johnstown is east. Moving southeast from Buffalo to Olean is also east.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step 1: Locate Cambria County, PA.**
Cambria County is located in the west-central part of Pennsylvania. Its county seat is Ebensburg, and it includes the city of Johnstown.

**Step 2: Locate Cattaraugus County, NY.**
Cattaraugus County is located in the southwestern part of New York State, bordering Pennsylvania. Its county seat is Little Valley, and it includes cities like Olean and Salamanca.

**Step 3: Compare their longitudes (East/West position).**
*   Cattaraugus County, NY, is situated in the extreme southwestern corner of New York.
*   Cambria County, PA, while in the western half of Pennsylvania, is located significantly *east* of Pennsylvania's western border with Ohio, and also *east* of the westernmost parts of New York (like Chautauqua County, which borders Cattaraugus to the west).

If you visualize a map, Cattaraugus County in NY is positioned to the *north and west* of much of central Pennsylvania. To reach Cambria County from Cattaraugus County, you would generally travel south and *east*. Conversely, if you start in Cambria County and want to go to Cattaraugus County, you would travel north and *west*.

Therefore, Cambria County is geographically located to the *east* of Cattaraugus County.

**Final Answer:**

No.
