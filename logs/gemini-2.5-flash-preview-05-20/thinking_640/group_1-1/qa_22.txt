*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here’s how I'm going to tackle this. First, I need to break down the question: "Is Lake Martin, Alabama, south of the Dal-Tex Building in Texas?" and I have to show *exactly* how I figured it out. The final answer is just a "Yes" or "No," but getting there requires a clear, step-by-step process.

My main strategy is obvious: Location, Location, Location. I need the latitude and longitude for both places. The "south of" part hinges on understanding that latitude decreases as you head towards the equator.

So, step one: find the coordinates for Lake Martin, Alabama. I'll run a search for "Lake Martin, AL coordinates."  I'm getting a latitude of about 32.75° North and around 85.90° West. Okay, good start.  I could get more granular and account for the entire lake's extent, but for a general "south of" comparison, I can use a representative point—the center seems fine. It's close enough for this level of detail.

Next up: the Dal-Tex Building.  I'll search "Dal-Tex Building, Dallas, TX coordinates" or just "Dal-Tex Building Dallas TX" and see what comes up. Ah, 411 Elm Street, Dallas, TX.  And I'm getting about 32.78° North latitude and 96.80° West longitude.

Now for the fun part: comparing the latitudes. Lake Martin is around 32.75° N, and the Dal-Tex Building is around 32.78° N.  "South of" means a *lower* latitude. Since 32.75 is less than 32.78, Lake Martin is further south.

Okay, so I'm going to lay out the coordinates I found for each location, explain the "south of" concept (lower latitude), compare the latitudes, and then – based on that direct comparison – deliver the final verdict.  Easy peasy.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step 1: Determine the approximate latitude of Lake Martin, Alabama.**
*   Using mapping tools, the approximate center of Lake Martin, Alabama, is around **32.75° North latitude**. (The lake spans from roughly 32.6°N to 32.8°N).

**Step 2: Determine the approximate latitude of the Dal-Tex Building, Texas.**
*   The Dal-Tex Building is located at 411 Elm St, Dallas, TX. Its approximate latitude is around **32.78° North latitude**.

**Step 3: Compare the latitudes.**
*   Lake Martin, AL: ~32.75° N
*   Dal-Tex Building, TX: ~32.78° N

**Step 4: Understand "south of".**
*   In terms of latitude, "south of" means having a *lower* numerical latitude (closer to the equator).

**Step 5: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison.**
*   Since 32.75° N (Lake Martin) is a lower latitude than 32.78° N (Dal-Tex Building), Lake Martin is indeed located south of the Dal-Tex Building.

**Final Answer:**
Yes
