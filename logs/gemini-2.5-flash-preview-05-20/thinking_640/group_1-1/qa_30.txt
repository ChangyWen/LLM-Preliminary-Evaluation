*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, let's tackle this. The question is, essentially, "Is Pragser Wildsee west of Lake Vico?" My approach is systematic; I need to be precise here.

First things first: I break down the query. I know the core task: compare locations, and determine a directional relationship - specifically, "west of." I also know what the deliverable is - a reasoned explanation, step-by-step, leading to a "Yes" or "No" answer.

Now, I think about the most reliable way to compare locations geographically. Coordinates. Latitude and longitude are the gold standard. "West of" means the longitude of the first location must be *less than* the longitude of the second. That’s my operative principle.

Here's how I'll execute:

1.  I start with Pragser Wildsee. I'll quickly search for its coordinates. I expect something like: "Pragser Wildsee coordinates" should yield the data. The results should show me roughly 46.69° N, 12.08° E.
2.  Next, Lake Vico. Same process: "Lake Vico coordinates" is my search term. I'll be looking for its latitude and longitude, and expecting something like 42.33° N, 12.17° E.
3.  Time for the crucial comparison. I'll take the longitudes. Pragser Wildsee is around 12.08° E, and Lake Vico is around 12.17° E.
4.  Now, I apply the "west of" rule. Does Pragser Wildsee's longitude (12.08° E) come before Lake Vico's (12.17° E)? Is 12.08 < 12.17? Yes, it is.

I then formulate my answer in a methodical way:

*   Step 1: Find the coordinates of Pragser Wildsee.
*   Step 2: Find the coordinates of Lake Vico.
*   Step 3: Compare the longitudes.
*   Step 4: Determine if Pragser Wildsee's longitude is less than Lake Vico's, indicating it is to the west.

And the final answer? Based on the comparison, Pragser Wildsee *is* west of Lake Vico. Therefore, "Yes."

Before I finalize, I need to check myself. Are the coordinates even *plausible*? Yes, the locations are in Italy. Does the longitude comparison hold up? Yes, 12.08 is to the west of 12.17. Have I addressed the entire question? Yes, I have. Okay, I'm satisfied.

Here's my step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step-by-step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the geographical coordinates of Pragser Wildsee (Lago di Braies).**
    *   Pragser Wildsee is located in South Tyrol, Italy.
    *   Approximate coordinates: **46.69° N, 12.08° E**

2.  **Identify the geographical coordinates of Lake Vico (Lago di Vico).**
    *   Lake Vico is located in Lazio, Italy, near Viterbo.
    *   Approximate coordinates: **42.33° N, 12.17° E**

3.  **Compare the longitudes of the two locations.**
    *   For a location to be "west of" another, its longitude must be a smaller (more westerly) value.
    *   Pragser Wildsee Longitude: 12.08° E
    *   Lake Vico Longitude: 12.17° E

4.  **Determine the relationship.**
    *   Comparing 12.08° E and 12.17° E, we see that 12.08 is indeed less than 12.17. This means Pragser Wildsee is located further west than Lake Vico.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
