*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this spatial reasoning problem. My initial question is clear: is Garnavillo, Iowa, east of Newellton, Louisiana?  Easy enough, I'll need to figure out their longitudinal positions. The strategy is straightforward: I'll use a reliable mapping tool – Google Maps is perfect for a quick check – to find the coordinates for each location. I know that longitude is what determines east-west positioning.

First, let's get Garnavillo, IA. I'll search for it, and quickly spot the coordinates: approximately 42.88° North, and, crucially, **-91.28° West**.  Okay, now Newellton, LA. A quick search yields approximately 31.95° North and **-91.20° West**.

Now for the comparison. Garnavillo is at -91.28° West, and Newellton is at -91.20° West.  Remembering how longitude works, I know that numbers get *less negative* as you move eastward.  So, -91.20 is *east* of -91.28.  Therefore, since Newellton's longitude is "east" of Garnavillo's, Newellton is east of Garnavillo.  The original question asks if Garnavillo is *east* of Newellton, which is the opposite of what I just found.

The final answer is therefore *no*.  

To spell it out for clarity, the steps went like this: (1) Find the longitude of Garnavillo, IA. (2) Find the longitude of Newellton, LA. (3) Compare the longitudes. (4) Determine the relative east-west positions. (5) State the final answer.  Elementary, my dear Watson.

To determine if Garnavillo, IA is located east of Newellton, LA, we need to compare their longitudes. Locations with a longitude further to the east will have a less negative (or more positive, if using 0-360) western longitude value.

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Find the longitude of Garnavillo, IA:**
    *   Using a mapping tool (like Google Maps), the approximate coordinates for Garnavillo, IA are: 42.88° N, **91.28° W**.

2.  **Find the longitude of Newellton, LA:**
    *   Using a mapping tool, the approximate coordinates for Newellton, LA are: 31.95° N, **91.20° W**.

3.  **Compare the longitudes:**
    *   Garnavillo, IA: 91.28° W
    *   Newellton, LA: 91.20° W

    When comparing western longitudes, a smaller numerical value (closer to 0) indicates a location further to the east.
    *   91.20 is less than 91.28.

4.  **Determine the relative position:**
    *   Since Newellton, LA (91.20° W) has a longitude value that is numerically smaller than Garnavillo, IA (91.28° W), Newellton, LA is located *east* of Garnavillo, IA.
    *   Conversely, Garnavillo, IA is located *west* of Newellton, LA.

**Final Answer:**

No.
