*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'm going to approach this. The user wants to know if a spot in Manhattan is east of a spot in Queens, and wants a step-by-step explanation. Got it. My process will be straightforward, focusing on comparing longitudes.

First, I'll pinpoint the two locations: Red Balloon Learning Center in Manhattan and Hunters Point S Park Playground in Queens. Next, I'll use a reliable mapping service – Google Maps is perfect for this – to get their longitudes. The key is that a smaller (more negative) longitude means the location is further west. Conversely, a larger (less negative) longitude means it's further east.

So, let's get specific. I'll quickly search for "Red Balloon Learning Center, Manhattan". Looks like there are several, so I'll use the one at 175 W 73rd St, New York, NY 10023. A quick search gives me a longitude of roughly -73.9819 degrees.

Then, I'll find the Hunters Point playground. Searching for "Hunters Point S Park Playground, Queens" should be exact. That gives me an approximate longitude of -73.9550 degrees.

Now for the crucial comparison: -73.9819 versus -73.9550. Remember, we're dealing with negative numbers, so I need to be careful. Is -73.9819 *greater than* -73.9550? No. It’s *less than*. This means that the Red Balloon Learning Center is west of Hunters Point.
