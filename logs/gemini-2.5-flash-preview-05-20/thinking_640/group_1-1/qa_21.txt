*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'm approaching this question about the Sangre de Cristo range:

First, I need to break down the question: "Is the Sangre de Cristo Range in Colorado east of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in Colorado?" It's asking me for a reasoned, step-by-step answer, culminating in a simple "Yes" or "No".

Now, before I even start "calculating," I have some immediate thoughts. I *know* the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are a big deal in Colorado, and extend into New Mexico. The term "Range" and "Mountains" are often interchangeable in this context, or maybe "Range" refers to the whole thing, and "Mountains" is just part of it. That's the core of the potential trick here.

My game plan is clear. First, I need a very precise definition of "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" – what does that actually *mean* geographically? Then, I need to nail down the definition of "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" – same thing, precisely where is this? Then, I have to figure out the relationship between the two. Are they the same? Is one *part* of the other? Or are they completely separate, but perhaps *related* somehow? Finally, I can decide which is east of the other, if they aren't the same.

Alright, let's start defining things. Let's start with the more common, more broadly understood term, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. From my memory, and a quick check to confirm (or even to refresh my recall), the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are a substantial, continuous range that stretches across southern Colorado and into northern New Mexico. They basically form the eastern edge of the San Luis Valley in Colorado and run in a general north-south direction. And I definitely know some of the key peaks – Blanca Peak, Crestone Peak, Kit Carson Peak, all that.

Now, what about "Sangre de Cristo Range"? This is where it gets interesting. Usually, it’s just another way of referring to the *same* thing – the whole "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" chain. Geographically, sources usually treat them as synonymous. "Range" might just be used to emphasize the entire system, and "Mountains" might just mean a specific peak, but fundamentally, it's the *same* geographical feature.

Let's break this down.

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the terms:** We have "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO."
2.  **Define "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO":** This refers to the major mountain chain that runs from southern Colorado into northern New Mexico. In Colorado, it forms the eastern boundary of the San Luis Valley and includes many of the state's highest peaks (like Blanca Peak, Crestone Peak).
3.  **Define "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO":** Geographically, the term "Sangre de Cristo Range" is **synonymous** with "Sangre de Cristo Mountains." They refer to the *same* continuous mountain chain. There aren't two separate, distinct mountain chains in Colorado where one is called the "Range" and the other the "Mountains" and one is located east of the other.
4.  **Compare their locations:** Since "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" refer to the *identical* geographical feature, one cannot be located east of the other. They occupy the same space.

**Final Answer:**

No.
