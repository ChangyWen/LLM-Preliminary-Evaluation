*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, hereâ€™s how I'm going to approach this. First, I need to break down the question: Did Agnes of Aquitaine die later than William de Warenne? Simple enough. The core task is a date comparison.

So, I need to find their death dates.  Right, let's start with "Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy death date."  I *think* I know the one, she's also known as Agnes of Poitou, married to Peter I of Savoy.  Born around 1072, died around 1097, possibly 1095, but *definitely* 1097 is the accepted date, especially when she's Countess of Savoy.  *Wait*, I'd better double-check.  I don't want to get confused if there's another Agnes of Aquitaine floating around. Okay, confirmed, the Peter I of Savoy wife is the one.

Next, "William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey death date." He was a major player. Born around 1035. Ah, yes, he died June 24th, 1088.

Now for the comparison. Agnes of Aquitaine: 1097. William de Warenne: 1088. 1097 is definitely *later* than 1088.

So, to break it down for a clear answer: First, I identified Agnes's death date. Second, I identified William's death date. Third, I compared those dates. Fourth, I made a conclusion based on that comparison.

Therefore, the answer is **Yes**.
