*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's my thought process: First, I need to be absolutely clear on the goal: Determine if the location represented by ZIP code 98580, WA is west of the location at 97233, OR. Got it. That means a comparison of their east-west positions, or more specifically, their longitudes.

My strategy is straightforward: I need the longitude of each ZIP code. Given my experience, I know this involves looking up the coordinates. Now, I'll use my preferred method – probably a quick API call to a mapping service or a reliable ZIP code database. I'm going to use the conventional positive West Longitude values to avoid any confusion. A larger value indicates further west.

Okay, let's execute. I'll start by finding the coordinates for 98580, WA. Quickly, I'm able to determine that this ZIP code is in Rochester, WA, and its longitude is approximately 123.09 degrees West.

Next, I'll find the coordinates for 97233, OR. I know this is Portland, OR, and its longitude is roughly 122.52 degrees West.

Now for the comparison: 98580, WA is at 123.09° W, and 97233, OR is at 122.52° W. Since 123.09 is greater than 122.52, and in the positive West Longitude convention a larger value signifies further west, I've confirmed that 98580, WA is indeed west of 97233, OR.

To break it down logically:
1.  Get the longitude of each ZIP code.
2.  Find the longitude of 98580, WA.
3.  Find the longitude of 97233, OR.
4.  Compare the longitudes; the larger longitude means further west.
5. Confirm if 98580 is west of 97233.
