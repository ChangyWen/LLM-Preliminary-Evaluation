*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's what I'm thinking. The core question is a simple geographical comparison: is Flagler Estates south of Palatka? Straightforward.

To answer this, I'll need their locations. Latitude and longitude would be ideal, or at least a general understanding of their position within Florida.

My process will be pretty standard: I'll tap into my knowledge base, which I can think of as either my memory or a mapping tool if I need more detail. First, I'll check the locations. "Palatka, FL" – okay, I know that’s in Putnam County, central-ish Florida, on the St. Johns River. Hmm, roughly 29.65° N, if memory serves.

Now, "Flagler Estates, FL" – ah, that's the less obvious one. Right, it's in Collier County, Southwest Florida, near Naples. Around 26.2° N, I'd wager.

Now, I just compare. Palatka is roughly 29.65° N, and Flagler Estates is roughly 26.2° N. Lower latitude means further south. Therefore, Flagler Estates is further south.

To be clear, my steps would be: 1) Identify locations. 2) Establish their approximate latitude. 3) Compare those latitudes. 4) Conclude based on that comparison.

So, yes. Flagler Estates *is* south of Palatka.
