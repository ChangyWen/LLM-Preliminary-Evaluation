Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know about gravity on the Moon compared to Earth – specifically, if it's less. I need to build a step-by-step explanation and then give a clear yes/no answer.

First, I need to get crystal clear on what "acceleration due to gravity" actually *is*. Right, it's the acceleration caused by the gravitational pull of a celestial body. I instantly recall the standard formula:  $g = GM/R^2$.  Where G is the gravitational constant – that's a constant, so it's the same everywhere, which helps.  M is the mass, and R is the radius – the distance from the center, essentially.

Next, I need to identify the two objects in the question: the Earth and the Moon.

Now, I'm going to compare their relevant properties: mass and radius. Earth is much more massive than the Moon, and its radius is significantly larger too. The Earth's mass is roughly 81 times greater than the Moon's, and the radius of the Earth is approximately 3.7 times greater.

I'll apply the formula to both.  For Earth, $g_E = GM_E / R_E^2$. For the Moon, $g_M = GM_M / R_M^2$.

Now for the *qualitative* comparison.  A larger mass *increases* g, so Earth's larger mass should mean it has more gravity. But a larger radius *decreases* g, so the Earth's larger radius would *decrease* the gravity. This is where I need to be careful. It's the net effect that matters.

Time for the *quantitative* comparison.  Let me grab some approximate numbers.  Earth's mass is about 5.97 x 10^24 kg, and the Moon's about 7.35 x 10^22 kg.  That gives a mass ratio of about 81.2.  Earth's radius is approximately 6.37 x 10^6 m, and the Moon's is about 1.74 x 10^6 m, yielding a radius ratio of around 3.66, and the squared radius ratio is about 13.4.

Now let's calculate the ratio of $g_E$ to $g_M$:  $g_E / g_M = (GM_E / R_E^2) / (GM_M / R_M^2)$. This simplifies to $g_E / g_M = (M_E / M_M) / (R_E / R_M)^2$. So it's the mass ratio divided by the square of the radius ratio, which would be around 81.2/13.4 ≈ 6.

Therefore, acceleration due to gravity on the Moon *is* less than on Earth.

Yes, the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is less than that on Earth.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**1. Understand the Formula for Acceleration Due to Gravity (g):**
The acceleration due to gravity ($g$) on the surface of a celestial body is given by the formula:
$g = GM/R^2$
Where:
*   $G$ is the universal gravitational constant (a constant value everywhere in the universe).
*   $M$ is the mass of the celestial body.
*   $R$ is the radius of the celestial body (distance from its center to its surface).

**2. Identify the Key Factors for Comparison:**
To compare $g$ on Earth ($g_E$) and the Moon ($g_M$), we need to compare their respective masses ($M$) and radii ($R$).

**3. Compare the Masses:**
*   **Earth's Mass ($M_E$):** Approximately $5.97 \times 10^{24}$ kg
*   **Moon's Mass ($M_M$):** Approximately $7.35 \times 10^{22}$ kg
*   **Comparison:** The Earth's mass is significantly greater than the Moon's mass (about 81 times greater).
    *   *Implication:* A larger mass ($M$) leads to a larger $g$. So, based on mass alone, Earth would have a much stronger gravitational pull.

**4. Compare the Radii:**
*   **Earth's Radius ($R_E$):** Approximately $6,371$ km
*   **Moon's Radius ($R_M$):** Approximately $1,737$ km
*   **Comparison:** The Earth's radius is larger than the Moon's radius (about 3.7 times greater).
    *   *Implication:* A larger radius ($R$) means the surface is further from the center of mass. Since $R$ is in the denominator and squared ($R^2$), a larger $R$ leads to a *smaller* $g$. So, based on radius alone, Earth's larger radius would slightly *reduce* its $g$ compared to if it had the Moon's radius.

**5. Combine the Effects:**
Let's look at the ratio of $g_E$ to $g_M$:
$g_E / g_M = (GM_E / R_E^2) / (GM_M / R_M^2)$
$g_E / g_M = (M_E / M_M) \times (R_M^2 / R_E^2)$
$g_E / g_M = (M_E / M_M) / (R_E / R_M)^2$

*   We know $M_E / M_M \approx 81.2$
*   We know $R_E / R_M \approx 3.67$, so $(R_E / R_M)^2 \approx (3.67)^2 \approx 13.47$

Now, substitute these values:
$g_E / g_M \approx 81.2 / 13.47 \approx 6.03$

This calculation shows that $g_E$ is approximately 6 times greater than $g_M$.

**6. Conclusion:**
The effect of Earth's much larger mass (which increases $g$) far outweighs the effect of its larger radius (which decreases $g$). Therefore, the net acceleration due to gravity on Earth is significantly stronger than on the Moon.

*   **Approximate Values:**
    *   $g_{Earth} \approx 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$
    *   $g_{Moon} \approx 1.62 \text{ m/s}^2$

$1.62 \text{ m/s}^2$ is clearly less than $9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$.

**Final Answer:** Yes
