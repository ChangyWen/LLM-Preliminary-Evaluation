*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's my thought process:

Right off the bat, the question's simple: comparing ocean *size*, specifically surface area. That's key. I already know the basics – Pacific is biggest, Atlantic is second. But I need to back that up with solid data, which means thinking through a structured response.

First things first, I'm going to identify *exactly* what's being compared: the Pacific and the Atlantic. Then, I need the crucial metric: *surface area*. Okay, time to pull the numbers. I know the Pacific is huge – roughly a third of the Earth, or half of the total water surface. I'm going to mentally reach for the commonly accepted figure – about 165-169 million square kilometers. Let's go with a common number, to be safe.

The Atlantic, of course, is significantly smaller, but still massive. The figures are typically in the range of 85-106 million square kilometers, but that depends on how you define the Southern Ocean.

Now, I have to structure my answer logically. I'll break it down into a series of steps. First I identify the oceans. Second I state that we are measuring the surface area of each. Then, I will provide the approximate surface area for each: The Pacific will be approximately 165.25 million square kilometers, and then, the Atlantic will be roughly 106.46 million square kilometers. Comparing those numbers is trivial – the Pacific is larger. Finally, I'll conclude with the comparison.

Yes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step 1: Identify the Surface Area of the Pacific Ocean.**
The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's oceanic divisions. Its surface area is approximately **165.25 million square kilometers (63.8 million square miles)**.

**Step 2: Identify the Surface Area of the Atlantic Ocean.**
The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest ocean. Its surface area is approximately **106.46 million square kilometers (41.1 million square miles)**.

**Step 3: Compare the Surface Areas.**
By comparing the two figures:
*   Pacific Ocean: 165.25 million km²
*   Atlantic Ocean: 106.46 million km²

Since 165.25 million km² is greater than 106.46 million km², the Pacific Ocean is significantly larger than the Atlantic Ocean. In fact, the Pacific Ocean is larger than all of Earth's landmass combined.

**Final Answer:** Yes
