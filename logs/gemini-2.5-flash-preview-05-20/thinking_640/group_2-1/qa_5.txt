*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this simple geographical comparison:

First off, the question "Is Russia larger in area than Australia?" – clear and concise. I immediately understand I need to compare land areas, straightforward stuff.

My brain's internal database, honed over years of experience (and perhaps a few maps!), kicks in. I've got the key figures: Russia's roughly 17.1 million square kilometers, Australia's about 7.7 million. These are standard, well-established values.

Now comes the quick, numerical comparison. 17.1 versus 7.7 – no contest. The logic is self-evident. 17.1 > 7.7.

To formalize the reasoning, I need to spell it out clearly. I’d state each area, then explicitly compare them, making the conclusion irrefutable.

The final answer, obviously, is "Yes". Then, I'll construct a precise, definitive response – starting with "Yes", followed by the area figures, and ending with the explicit comparison to ensure there’s zero ambiguity. It needs to be clear, factual, and leave no room for misinterpretation. It's all about precision.

Let's compare the areas of Russia and Australia:

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the area of Russia:** The total area of Russia is approximately **17,098,246 square kilometers (6,601,670 square miles)**.
2.  **Identify the area of Australia:** The total area of Australia is approximately **7,692,024 square kilometers (2,969,907 square miles)**.
3.  **Compare the two figures:**
    *   Russia: ~17.1 million sq km
    *   Australia: ~7.7 million sq km
    Clearly, 17.1 million is significantly larger than 7.7 million.

**Final Answer:**

Yes.
