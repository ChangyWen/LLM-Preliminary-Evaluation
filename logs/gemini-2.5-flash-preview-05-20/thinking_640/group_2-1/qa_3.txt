*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this question: "Did Albert Einstein die later than Isaac Newton?" First, I break down the question: it's a straightforward date comparison. Then, I know I need the death dates of both men.

My internal knowledge base provides a good starting point. I *know* Newton's a 17th/18th-century figure; I'm thinking he died in the early 1700s. A quick fact-check (either recalling it from memory or verifying) confirms: March 31, 1727. Perfect.

Einstein, on the other hand, is a 20th-century guy. My intuition says he died mid-century. Again, I'll double-check, and yep, April 18, 1955. Got it.

Now the easy part: comparing those years, 1727 vs. 1955. Clearly, 1955 is later.

So, how do I structure this for the answer? Iâ€™ll present the dates, then the comparison. Easy peasy.

Here's how I'll formulate it:

1.  Newton's death date: March 31, 1727.
2.  Einstein's death date: April 18, 1955.
3.  1955 is later than 1727.

Therefore, the final answer: **Yes**. The whole process is driven by my familiarity with the general timelines of prominent scientists, followed by a quick verification to ensure accuracy.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Determine Isaac Newton's death date:** Isaac Newton died on March 31, 1727.
2.  **Determine Albert Einstein's death date:** Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955.
3.  **Compare the two dates:** 1955 is a later year than 1727.

**Final Answer:**
Yes.
