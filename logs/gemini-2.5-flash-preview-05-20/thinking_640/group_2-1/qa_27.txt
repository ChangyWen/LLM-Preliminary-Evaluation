*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this, thinking through the problem step-by-step.  First, I need to really *understand* the request: I'm essentially asked to determine if the melting point of ice is lower than the boiling point of water, and then justify my conclusion with a clear, reasoned explanation. I'll need to make sure I'm absolutely precise and cover all the necessary information.

Okay, let's start with a quick breakdown.  I'll break down the question and break it into easy-to-digest parts. I'll also need to give the answer in a Yes/No format. Then, I'll need to clearly and logically explain *why* I believe what I believe.

Now, I'll immediately need to access my knowledge base, recalling fundamental principles. I need to remember the *definitions* of melting and boiling points.  I can picture the phase changes in my mind and the way energy is transferred, I remember the thermal behavior. Most importantly, I need to *explicitly* acknowledge the importance of standard conditions – that's crucial because melting and boiling points are pressure-dependent. I'll assume standard atmospheric pressure: 1 atmosphere.

So, now I need the specific values for the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water, under standard conditions.  I *know* that ice melts at 0°C.  And water boils at 100°C.  Elementary.

Then comes the comparison. Is 0°C lower than 100°C? The answer is clear.

I'll lay out the reasoning in a structured, step-by-step way.  I'll need to make sure each step is crystal clear and complete. Step one: define melting point and state its value. Step two: define boiling point and state its value. And crucially, in both steps, I'll reiterate the standard pressure. Step three: the actual comparison. Step four: the conclusion.

And finally, I'll format my answer.  The final answer is "Yes," and then the detailed explanation. I can picture my explanation and am going to start with a quick mental note and rough draft. Now I can refine it and perfect it to provide a concise yet complete response.

**Final Answer:** Yes

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the Melting Point of Ice:** Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere), the melting point of ice is **0 degrees Celsius (0°C)**. This is the temperature at which solid water (ice) transforms into liquid water.

2.  **Identify the Boiling Point of Water:** Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere), the boiling point of water is **100 degrees Celsius (100°C)**. This is the temperature at which liquid water transforms into gaseous water (steam).

3.  **Compare the Temperatures:** Comparing the two values:
    *   Melting point of ice = 0°C
    *   Boiling point of water = 100°C

    Since 0°C is significantly lower than 100°C, the melting point of ice is indeed lower than the boiling point of water.
