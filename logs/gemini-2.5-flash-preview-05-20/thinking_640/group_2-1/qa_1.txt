*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's see… the question is a simple comparison: blue whale versus elephant, weight-wise. The goal is a "Yes" or "No" answer with supporting steps. Right, pretty straightforward.

My immediate reaction? Blue whale, no contest. It's the biggest thing alive. The elephant, even the African, just can't compete. But, of course, I can't just *say* that. Gotta show my work, for clarity and rigor.

Alright, the plan: first, I need reliable weight ranges. Let's see... Blue whales – I'm recalling something like 100-200 tons, right? Definitely in the hundreds of tons range. Hmm… gotta be specific and account for variations. It’s also the largest animal, so I'm off to a good start.

Then, the elephant. I know African elephants are the largest land animals, so that's what I'll use for the comparison to make the case. I'm thinking maybe 6-7 tons for a large adult? Something like that. I'll need to be accurate to give a good answer.

Now for the reasoning... First I state the Blue Whale's weight range, and mention it's the biggest. Then, I state the African elephant's weight range, because it is the largest on land. Then a direct weight comparison, highlighting the substantial difference. Last, just state the answer.

Yes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Determine the typical weight of a Blue Whale:**
    *   Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) are the largest animals on Earth.
    *   An adult blue whale typically weighs between **100 to 200 metric tons** (approximately 220,000 to 440,000 pounds).

2.  **Determine the typical weight of an Elephant:**
    *   Elephants are the largest land animals. There are two main species: African and Asian.
    *   An adult African bush elephant (the largest elephant species) typically weighs between **4 to 7 metric tons** (approximately 8,800 to 15,400 pounds).
    *   An adult Asian elephant typically weighs between 3 to 5 metric tons.

3.  **Compare the weights:**
    *   Comparing the maximum weight of the largest elephant (7 metric tons) to the minimum weight of a blue whale (100 metric tons), it's clear that a blue whale is significantly heavier.
    *   A blue whale can be more than 14 times heavier than the largest elephant.

**Final Answer:**

Yes.
