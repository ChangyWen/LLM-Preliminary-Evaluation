*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether light travels faster than sound, and I need to explain my reasoning step-by-step.

1.  **First, what are we talking about?**  I need to start with the basics. Light is an electromagnetic wave, part of the electromagnetic spectrum.  It doesn't need a medium to travel, it zips along at a constant speed. Sound, on the other hand, is a mechanical wave. It's a vibration that needs a medium, like air or water, to propagate.

2.  **Now, the speeds.**  I know that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fundamental constant; it’s about 300 million meters per second, or, roughly, 300,000 kilometers per second.  It's the ultimate speed limit in the universe, according to relativity.  Sound is significantly slower. In air, at room temperature, it's approximately 343 meters per second. Of course, that value changes depending on the temperature and the medium. Sound travels much faster in solids like steel.

3.  **Let's compare these numbers.** 300,000,000 meters per second versus 343 meters per second.  The difference is enormous!  Light is, without any shadow of a doubt, *much* faster.

4.  **Real-world examples seal the deal.**  Think about lightning and thunder. You *always* see the lightning flash before you hear the thunder.  The light arrives almost instantaneously; the sound takes time to catch up.  It's the same with fireworks. You see the burst of light first, then hear the sound. Echoes also showcase this. Sound takes a measurable amount of time to travel to a surface and back. Light reflected from a surface appears instantaneous to the human eye, over short distances.

5.  **Therefore, I can definitively say:**  Yes, light is faster than sound. The difference in speeds is massive, which we experience daily.

Yes, the speed of light is significantly faster than the speed of sound.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understanding Light and Sound:**
    *   **Light:** Light is an electromagnetic wave. It does not require a medium to travel and can propagate through a vacuum. Its speed is a fundamental constant of the universe.
    *   **Sound:** Sound is a mechanical wave. It requires a medium (like air, water, or solids) to travel, as it propagates through vibrations of particles within that medium.

2.  **Typical Speeds:**
    *   **Speed of Light (c):** In a vacuum, the speed of light is approximately **299,792,458 meters per second (m/s)**, often rounded to 300,000,000 m/s or 3 x 10^8 m/s. This is the fastest speed at which anything can travel in the universe.
    *   **Speed of Sound:** The speed of sound varies depending on the medium and its temperature.
        *   In **air at 20°C (68°F)**, the speed of sound is approximately **343 meters per second (m/s)**.
        *   In water, it's around 1,500 m/s.
        *   In steel, it's around 5,100 m/s.

3.  **Direct Comparison:**
    *   Comparing the speed of light in a vacuum (approx. 300,000,000 m/s) to the speed of sound in air (approx. 343 m/s), we can see a massive difference.
    *   Light travels nearly a million times faster than sound in air.

4.  **Real-World Observations:**
    *   **Lightning and Thunder:** We always see the flash of lightning before we hear the rumble of thunder, even though they occur simultaneously. This is because light reaches our eyes almost instantly, while sound takes time to travel the distance.
    *   **Fireworks:** Similarly, when watching a distant fireworks display, you see the explosion of light and color before you hear the accompanying boom.
    *   **Echoes:** Sound waves take a noticeable amount of time to travel to a surface and reflect back, creating an echo. Light reflection, over typical human distances, appears instantaneous.

**Final Answer:**

**Yes**
