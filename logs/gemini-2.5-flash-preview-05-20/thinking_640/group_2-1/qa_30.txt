Okay, here's how I'd approach this question, breaking it down step-by-step.

Alright, the question is straightforward: humans versus dogs, lifespan comparison. I need a "Yes or No" answer *and* a clear explanation.

First, I'll tap into my existing knowledge. For humans, the typical lifespan... I'm thinking 70s, maybe even pushing into the 80s in developed countries. Of course, there are outliers – centenarians and the like – but we're talking averages. Key factors here are healthcare, nutrition, lifestyle, and genetics, as always.

Next, dogs. Their lifespan is clearly shorter. My gut feeling is a range of around 10-13 years, maybe a bit more or less depending on the breed. Again, outliers exist. Small dogs tend to live longer than giant breeds. Factors? Breed, size, definitely, and then diet, veterinary care, and genetics.

Now, for the direct comparison, a quick mental check. Humans: 70-80 years (on average). Dogs: 10-13 years. It's a no-brainer, really.

So, how to structure the "step-by-step reasoning"? Let's see…

**Step 1: Human Lifespan.** I need to define a general range. Globally, the average human lifespan is around 73-74 years, based on current data. Worth mentioning variations: developed countries have higher averages, while developing countries can be lower. But the global average is a decent starting point.

**Step 2: Dog Lifespan.** Again, a range is needed. The average is *significantly* shorter, typically 10-13 years. Crucial to acknowledge influencing factors here: breed and size are key. Small dogs often live longer—some can hit 14-16+ years. Big breeds? Shorter lives, often 6-10 years. Genetics (predisposition to diseases) is also important, as are diet, exercise, and good veterinary care (preventative medicine is key).

**Step 3: Compare the Averages.** Simply state the comparison. So: "Comparing these two averages..." a human lifespan of 73-74 years is vastly longer than a dog's lifespan of 10-13 years."

**Step 4: Conclusion.** Then I'd reiterate the answer based on the comparison. Simple and clear, and well-supported by the evidence, with acknowledgment of important caveats.

Yes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Determine the Average Human Lifespan:**
    *   Globally, the average human lifespan is currently around **73-74 years**. This figure can vary significantly by country (e.g., over 80 years in many developed nations, lower in some developing nations), but the global average provides a good general benchmark.

2.  **Determine the Average Dog Lifespan:**
    *   The average lifespan of a dog is significantly shorter, typically ranging from **10 to 13 years**.
    *   This average can vary greatly depending on factors such as:
        *   **Breed:** Smaller breeds generally live longer (e.g., Chihuahuas can live 15-20 years), while larger and giant breeds tend to have shorter lifespans (e.g., Great Danes often live 7-10 years).
        *   **Genetics:** Predisposition to certain health issues.
        *   **Care:** Diet, exercise, and access to veterinary care (vaccinations, preventative medicine, treatment for illnesses).

3.  **Compare the Averages:**
    *   Comparing the average human lifespan (73-74 years) to the average dog lifespan (10-13 years), it is clear that the human lifespan is considerably longer.

**Final Answer:** Yes
