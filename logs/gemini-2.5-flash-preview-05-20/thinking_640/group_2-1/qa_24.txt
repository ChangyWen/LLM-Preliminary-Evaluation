*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this Venusian day length question. First, I need to break down exactly what's being asked. It's a simple "yes/no," but the request for step-by-step reasoning is key. I need to consider "day" – do they mean a sidereal day, which is the time it takes to rotate on its axis relative to the stars, or a solar day, the period determined by the apparent position of the sun? Typically, it's the latter, as that dictates the day/night cycle we experience, but Venus is, well, *Venus*. Its unique characteristics make both types of day important to consider.

Now, I'm mentally sifting through my knowledge base. I know Venus has a super slow sidereal day, and its rotation is *retrograde* which is crucial. Earth's sidereal day is, of course, about 24 hours, and our rotation is prograde. I'm also recalling their orbital periods – how long it takes each planet to orbit the sun.

Let's start with the sidereal day. Venus’s is around 243 Earth days. Earth's is roughly one. Clear winner here: Venus's sidereal day *is* longer.

But the solar day is more complicated. The fact that Venus spins backward has a huge impact.  I remember a formula to calculate the solar day, which I'll need to adapt for Venus's retrograde rotation. *Wait*, hold on a second. Something's off with that formula; I need to review it, and I suspect there's a more accurate approach. I need to factor in the impact of the planet’s orbital period and direction. Okay, that makes sense. Time to crunch some numbers. I'll need to calculate the solar day for Venus to compare to Earth's.

Yes, a day on Venus lasts significantly longer than a day on Earth.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **Define "Day":** When we talk about a "day" in common terms, we usually mean a **solar day** – the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky (e.g., noon to noon). This is what determines the length of daylight and nighttime. There's also a **sidereal day**, which is the time it takes for a planet to complete one full rotation on its axis relative to distant stars. For Venus, both are important due to its unique characteristics.

2.  **Venus's Rotation and Orbit:**
    *   **Rotation Period (Sidereal Day):** Venus rotates incredibly slowly. One full rotation on its axis takes about **243 Earth days**. This is the slowest rotation of any major planet in our solar system.
    *   **Direction of Rotation:** Uniquely, Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets (it's called **retrograde** rotation). If you were on Venus, the Sun would appear to rise in the west and set in the east.
    *   **Orbital Period (Year):** Venus orbits the Sun much faster than it rotates. One full orbit around the Sun takes about **225 Earth days**.

3.  **Earth's Rotation and Orbit:**
    *   **Rotation Period (Sidereal Day):** Earth completes one rotation on its axis in about 23 hours and 56 minutes (approximately 1 Earth day).
    *   **Orbital Period (Year):** Earth completes one orbit around the Sun in about 365.25 Earth days.
    *   **Solar Day:** Because Earth rotates in the same direction it orbits (prograde), its solar day (24 hours) is slightly longer than its sidereal day.

4.  **Calculating Venus's Solar Day:**
    *   Because Venus rotates so slowly *and* in the opposite direction to its orbit, its solar day is calculated differently. The retrograde rotation means that the Sun appears to move across the sky *faster* than if it were rotating prograde.
    *   The solar day on Venus is approximately **116.75 Earth days**.

5.  **Comparison:**
    *   **Venus Solar Day:** ~116.75 Earth days
    *   **Earth Solar Day:** 1 Earth day

**Conclusion:**

A day on Venus (its solar day) lasts approximately 116.75 Earth days, while a day on Earth lasts 1 Earth day.

**Final Answer: Yes**
