*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here’s how I'd tackle this. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The core question is simple: Which is taller, Everest or K2? They want my reasoning laid out step-by-step, and a yes or no answer at the end. No problem.

My expertise kicks in immediately here. I have a good grasp of world geography and mountain ranges. I know, almost instinctively, that Mount Everest is the highest peak on Earth *above sea level*. K2 is the second highest. That much is rock solid in my mental database.

Now, for pinpoint accuracy, I'll access those specific height numbers. I can retrieve these easily; Everest is around 8,848.86 meters, while K2 clocks in at about 8,611 meters.

Next, I'll do the comparison. 8,848.86 is definitely greater than 8,611. That’s where the math part comes in.

So, how to articulate this clearly and concisely? I will create a detailed step by step approach. First, state Everest’s height. Then, state K2’s. Then compare the numbers. And, finally, draw the conclusion.

Now, for the actual answer construction.

*   **Step 1:** Mount Everest, known as Sagarmatha in Nepal and Chomolungma in Tibet, is the highest peak. Its official height, from the agreement in 2020 between China and Nepal, is 8,848.86 meters.
*   **Step 2:** K2, also known as Mount Godwin Austen, is the second-highest. It measures 8,611 meters above sea level.
*   **Step 3:** We compare: 8,848.86 meters (Everest) compared to 8,611 meters (K2).
*   **Step 4:** Clearly, Mount Everest is taller.

**Final Answer: Yes.**

I’m going to review this to confirm precision, and clarity. It's all there. This is a pretty straightforward, accurate answer. The language is direct, I answered the question, I have provided a full explanation, including the final yes or no answer, and used reliable figures. All good!

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the height of Mount Everest:** Mount Everest is officially recognized as the highest mountain in the world above sea level. Its height is 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet).
2.  **Identify the height of K2:** K2 (Mount Godwin Austen) is the second-highest mountain in the world. Its height is 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) above sea level.
3.  **Compare the two heights:** By comparing 8,848.86 meters (Everest) with 8,611 meters (K2), it is evident that 8,848.86 is a greater number than 8,611.
4.  **Conclude which mountain is taller:** Since Mount Everest's elevation is greater than K2's elevation, Mount Everest is taller.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
