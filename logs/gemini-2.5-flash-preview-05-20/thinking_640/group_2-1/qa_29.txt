*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this. First, I need to pinpoint exactly what the user is after: a comparison of red and blue light wavelengths with a clear "Yes/No" response, backed by step-by-step reasoning.

Right, let's dive into the core physics. Light, fundamentally, is an electromagnetic wave. I know the visible spectrum is just a slice of the larger EM spectrum. Key here is the direct link between color and wavelength: different colors of light correspond to different wavelengths, which also means different frequencies and energies. The mnemonic ROYGBIV is invaluable here.

Now, where do red and blue fit in this ROYGBIV order? Red is at the long wavelength end and blue is further along in the spectrum. Okay, the crucial question is, which end has longer wavelengths? I need to be absolutely precise here. Longer wavelength means lower frequency, which means lower energy. Radio waves have long wavelengths and low energy. Gamma rays have short wavelengths and high energy. Red falls near the infrared, so it has a longer wavelength than blue. Violet is at the other extreme, near the ultraviolet. Thus, red light must have a longer wavelength than blue.

Alright, now for structuring the explanation.

**Step 1: Define Light and Wavelength:** I'll start by stating that light travels as an electromagnetic wave, and the key property we're focusing on is its wavelength, the distance between crests of the wave.

**Step 2: The Visible Spectrum:** Then, I'll introduce that visible light—the light we see—is actually a range of wavelengths, which we perceive as different colors. I'll reference the ROYGBIV order for clarity.

**Step 3: Relating Color to Wavelength:** Next, I'll explicitly state the key concept that red lies at the long-wavelength end of the visible spectrum, while blue/violet lies closer to the short-wavelength end. I can include approximate wavelength ranges for the visible spectrum, but that's not strictly necessary.

**Step 4: Comparing Red and Blue:** Then, I'll explicitly compare red and blue: "Red light has a longer wavelength than blue light."

**Step 5: The Conclusion:** To summarise the comparison and give a "Yes" response, I will finish with something like, "Therefore, yes, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light."

Finally, I'll review. I'll check for clarity and precision: Is the language understandable for a general audience? Is the reasoning logically sound and easy to follow? Does it fully address the user's question? I should make sure my answer is unambiguous and that the "Yes" is crystal clear at the end. Everything looks good.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understanding Light as a Wave:** Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, which travels in waves. Like all waves, it has a property called wavelength, which is the distance between two consecutive crests or troughs of the wave.

2.  **The Visible Spectrum:** The light that human eyes can perceive is called the visible spectrum. This spectrum is a continuous range of wavelengths, and different wavelengths within this range are perceived by our brains as different colors.

3.  **Order of Colors by Wavelength:** Within the visible spectrum, colors are arranged in a specific order based on their wavelength. This order is commonly remembered by the acronym ROYGBIV:
    *   **R**ed
    *   **O**range
    *   **Y**ellow
    *   **G**reen
    *   **B**lue
    *   **I**ndigo
    *   **V**iolet

    In this sequence, red light has the longest wavelengths, and violet light has the shortest wavelengths. As you move from red towards violet, the wavelength progressively decreases.

4.  **Comparing Red and Blue Light:** Based on the order in the visible spectrum (ROYGBIV), red light is at the "R" end (longer wavelength end), and blue light is at the "B" end (shorter wavelength end, closer to violet).

5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the wavelength of red light is indeed longer than that of blue light.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
