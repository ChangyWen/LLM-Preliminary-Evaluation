Alright, here’s how I'll approach this. The question is a straightforward comparison: is the boiling point of water higher than its freezing point? Easy enough.

First, I need to nail down the basics. Boiling point – that’s 100°C under standard atmospheric pressure. Freezing point? Yep, that's 0°C, also at standard atmospheric pressure. Now for the comparison. 100°C versus 0°C... well, 100°C is undeniably higher.

To really break it down and make sure the answer is airtight, I'll structure my thoughts. Step 1: State the boiling point, including the crucial detail of "at standard atmospheric pressure." Step 2: Do the same for the freezing point. Step 3: Directly compare the values. And Step 4: draw a clear conclusion.

Let's get to it, as a starting point: Boiling point of water is 100°C. Freezing point is 0°C. Okay, 100°C is definitely greater than 0°C. So the answer, in short, is yes. I always try to refine my response, adding precision. Making sure I mention "standard atmospheric pressure." It’s crucial for accuracy. I'll also make sure the reasoning is clear, concise, and logically sound. Perfect. Let’s go.

Yes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step-by-step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the Boiling Point of Water:** At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere), the boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius (°C) or 212 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). This is the temperature at which liquid water turns into water vapor (gas).
2.  **Identify the Freezing Point of Water:** At standard atmospheric pressure, the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius (°C) or 32 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). This is the temperature at which liquid water turns into solid ice.
3.  **Compare the Temperatures:**
    *   Boiling Point: 100°C (or 212°F)
    *   Freezing Point: 0°C (or 32°F)
    Comparing these values, 100°C is a significantly higher temperature than 0°C (and 212°F is significantly higher than 32°F).

**Final Answer:**

Yes.
