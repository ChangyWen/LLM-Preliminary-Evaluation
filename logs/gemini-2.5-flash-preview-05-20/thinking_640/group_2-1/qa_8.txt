Okay, here's how I'd approach this question. First, I need to understand exactly what's being asked: compare the Sahara and Gobi in terms of temperature to determine which is "hotter." It seems simple enough, but it's important to be precise.

Right away, my mind jumps to the basics. The Sahara: Africa, scorching heat, sand everywhere, a true tropical desert. The Gobi: Asia, cold winters, maybe even snow, more of a rocky terrain, a temperate/cold desert. But, and this is crucial, the key thing to remember is that deserts are primarily defined by aridity, the lack of rain, not necessarily their temperature all the time.

So, to compare properly, I need a framework. Let's break it down like this: location/type of desert, temperature extremes (highs and lows), average temperatures if I can recall them, and overall climate classification. That’ll allow me to really get a sense of the comparison.

Now for the specifics. Let's dig into the Sahara first. It's in North Africa, covering a huge area and many different countries. It's a subtropical hot desert, we all know that. Summer highs? Oh, they're insane. Routinely above 40°C, often pushing towards 50°C. I've heard of record highs, but I don't necessarily need those figures for the assessment. Winter lows are generally mild, close to freezing maybe. Overall, extreme heat is the hallmark.

Next, the Gobi. Central Asia, mainly Mongolia and China. A cold winter desert, definitely. Summer highs can reach 30-40°C, still warm but not as reliably extreme as the Sahara. The killer is the winter: brutally cold. Frequently -20°C or lower, and snow is common. The defining characteristic here is that massive temperature swing, the vast difference between summer and winter.

Okay, synthesizing and comparing. In terms of summer heat, the Sahara wins hands down. Its summer average and peak highs are considerably higher. But the Gobi is much, much colder in winter. Thinking about "hotter" in the context of what people usually mean, what they want to know, it’s probably about those peak temperatures and consistency of high temperatures. The Sahara fits that definition far better. So even though the Gobi can get warm in the summer, its core defining characteristic is its cold winters, combined with its aridity.

Let's break down the characteristics of the Sahara Desert and the Gobi Desert to determine which is hotter.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand "Hotter":** When comparing deserts, "hotter" typically refers to higher average temperatures, especially during their respective warm seasons, and higher peak temperatures. It's important to consider both daily and seasonal extremes.

2.  **Analyze the Sahara Desert:**
    *   **Location:** North Africa, spanning multiple countries.
    *   **Climate Type:** Primarily a subtropical hot desert. Its location near the Tropic of Cancer, under the influence of stable high-pressure systems, leads to intense solar radiation year-round.
    *   **Temperature Characteristics:**
        *   **Summer:** Extremely hot. Daytime temperatures routinely exceed 40°C (104°F) and can often reach 45-50°C (113-122°F) or even higher in some areas. The highest recorded air temperature on Earth (though disputed, and not officially recognized by WMO) was once claimed in El Azizia, Libya (Sahara), at 58°C (136.4°F). While this record is now invalidated, it highlights the extreme heat potential.
        *   **Winter:** Generally mild to warm during the day, but nights can be cool, sometimes dropping to near freezing, especially in higher elevations or northern parts.
        *   **Overall:** Known for its consistently high temperatures and intense heat, particularly from late spring through early autumn.

3.  **Analyze the Gobi Desert:**
    *   **Location:** Central Asia, primarily in Mongolia and China.
    *   **Climate Type:** A cold winter desert (or temperate desert). It's located far from oceans, deep within the continental landmass, leading to extreme continental climate characteristics.
    *   **Temperature Characteristics:**
        *   **Summer:** Can be hot, with daytime temperatures reaching 30-40°C (86-104°F), similar to some hot desert summer days.
        *   **Winter:** Extremely cold. Temperatures routinely drop to -20°C (-4°F) and can plummet to -40°C (-40°F) or even lower. Snow and frost are common.
        *   **Overall:** Characterized by vast temperature swings between seasons. While its summers can be warm, its defining feature is its intensely cold winters.

4.  **Compare and Conclude:**
    *   **Peak Heat:** The Sahara consistently experiences higher peak temperatures and more prolonged periods of extreme heat during its warm season compared to the Gobi.
    *   **Average Warm Season Temperatures:** The average temperatures during the warm months are significantly higher in the Sahara.
    *   **Overall "Hotness":** While the Gobi can be hot in summer, its overall climate is defined by its extreme seasonal variations, including very cold winters. The Sahara, on the other hand, is characterized by its pervasive and intense heat, making it the hotter desert overall.

**Final Answer:**

**Yes**
