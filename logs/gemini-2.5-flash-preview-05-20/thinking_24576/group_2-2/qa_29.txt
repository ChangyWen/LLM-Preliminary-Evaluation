Alright, let's break this down. The question is whether blue light has a longer wavelength than red light. This is basic optics, so here's how I'd approach it.

First, I need to define my terms. Light is electromagnetic radiation, and wavelength is the distance between wave crests. Right, got it. Next, I recall the electromagnetic spectrum, and the tiny slice that is visible light. I instantly think of ROYGBIV – red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. That's key. Now, each color has its own range of wavelengths. Red is at one end, blue is near the other.

Now, the crucial part: I need to remember the *order* of colors by wavelength. ROYGBIV tells me that. Red is at the long-wavelength end, and as you move through the spectrum, the wavelengths get shorter. Blue is positioned after green but before violet. I can even go a bit further by adding some specific wavelengths to give more context. Red is roughly 700 nanometers and blue is around 450-500 nanometers. But remember, the *reasoning* doesn’t *require* the specific numbers.

So, red has the longer wavelength, and blue has a shorter one. Therefore, blue light's wavelength is *not* longer than red's. The answer is "No".

Let's break down the relationship between color and wavelength in the visible light spectrum.

**Step-by-step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understanding Light and Wavelength:** Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that travels in waves. The wavelength of light is the distance between two consecutive crests (or troughs) of its wave. Different colors of light correspond to different wavelengths.

2.  **The Visible Spectrum:** The visible light spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. It is composed of different colors, which we perceive as a rainbow.

3.  **Ordering Colors by Wavelength:** The colors within the visible spectrum are ordered by their wavelength. This order is commonly remembered by the acronym **ROYGBIV**:
    *   **R**ed
    *   **O**range
    *   **Y**ellow
    *   **G**reen
    *   **B**lue
    *   **I**ndigo
    *   **V**iolet

4.  **Wavelength Trend in ROYGBIV:** In the ROYGBIV sequence, wavelengths *decrease* from Red to Violet.
    *   **Red light** has the **longest** wavelengths in the visible spectrum (approximately 620-750 nanometers).
    *   **Violet light** has the **shortest** wavelengths (approximately 380-450 nanometers).

5.  **Comparing Red and Blue Light:**
    *   Red light is at the very beginning of the ROYGBIV sequence, indicating it has the longest wavelengths.
    *   Blue light is much further down the sequence, closer to the violet end, indicating it has significantly shorter wavelengths (approximately 450-495 nanometers).

6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the order of colors in the visible spectrum, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light. Therefore, blue light's wavelength is shorter than red light's.

**Final Answer:**

No.
