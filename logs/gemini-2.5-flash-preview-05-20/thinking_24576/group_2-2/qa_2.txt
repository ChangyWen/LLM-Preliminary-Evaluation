*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this question, "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?":

First, the core of this is a simple *height comparison*. I need to determine which mountain has a larger elevation.

My mental database kicks in. I immediately recall that Mount Everest is the world's highest peak â€“ that's fundamental geographic knowledge. K2? That's *the* second highest. That simple fact, honestly, almost settles it immediately, but let's be thorough.

Now, for the precision, I'll bring in the actual numbers. I know Everest clocks in around 8,848 meters. K2? About 8,611 meters. If needed I can drill down for the exact metric, but the numbers I've recalled are sufficient for the task.

The comparison is straightforward: Everest, 8,848 meters; K2, 8,611 meters.  Clearly, Everest's elevation is the greater.

So, laying out the *reasoning* would look something like this: "Mount Everest's height is approximately 8,848 meters. K2's height is approximately 8,611 meters. Since 8,848 meters is greater than 8,611 meters, K2 is not taller."

And the final answer? The answer is, unequivocally, "No, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest."

No.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Identify the height of Mount Everest:** Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, with an official elevation of **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)** above sea level.
2.  **Identify the height of K2 (Mount Godwin Austen):** K2 is the second-highest mountain in the world, with an elevation of **8,611 meters (28,251 feet)** above sea level.
3.  **Compare the two heights:**
    *   Mount Everest: 8,848.86 meters
    *   K2: 8,611 meters
    *   Since 8,848.86 is greater than 8,611, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

**Final Answer:** No.
