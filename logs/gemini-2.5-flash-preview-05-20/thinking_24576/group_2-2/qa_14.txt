*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this question. First, I need to be crystal clear on what's being asked: *absolute* heart size. Not relative, just which has the bigger heart, period. 

My initial thought? Given what I know about the animal kingdom, and being in my field, it seems pretty intuitive. The blue whale is the largest animal *ever*. The elephant is the largest land animal, which is also large, but clearly not on the same scale. Heart size generally scales with body size, so...blue whale, probably.

Now I need to back that up. Time to pull up the data. I remember the blue whale heart being truly astonishing. I've read reports on the weight and dimensions – something like a small car or golf cart! Let me think... yeah, around 400 to 600 kg. I've seen pictures of people working *inside* a blue whale aorta.

And the elephant? Okay, that's going to be significantly smaller. I know that they aren't small, but it’s just not in the same league. I remember elephants having hearts that are, what, maybe 12 to 21 kg? Much more manageable.

Alright, so here’s how I'd structure my answer. First, I'd lay down the basic principle: Heart size correlates with overall body mass. That's the key relationship. Then, I'd make it clear that a blue whale is *immensely* larger than an elephant. Provide the weight comparisons. Then, it's about the heart specifics. Blue whale heart: 400-600 kg, roughly the size of a small vehicle. Elephant heart: 12-21 kg. It's simple comparison now, the differences are orders of magnitude.

Therefore, the final answer is, the blue whale has the larger heart.

No.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Understand the Relationship Between Body Size and Heart Size:** In general, the size of an animal's heart is proportional to its overall body mass. Larger animals require a larger heart to pump blood efficiently throughout their much larger bodies.

2.  **Compare the Body Sizes of a Blue Whale and an Elephant:**
    *   **Blue Whale:** The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth. An adult blue whale can weigh up to 200 tons (approximately 400,000 pounds or 180,000 kg) and reach lengths of over 30 meters (100 feet).
    *   **Elephant:** The African bush elephant is the largest land animal. An adult male African elephant can weigh up to 6-7 tons (approximately 12,000-14,000 pounds or 5,400-6,300 kg) and stand about 4 meters (13 feet) tall.

3.  **Compare the Estimated Heart Sizes:**
    *   **Blue Whale Heart:** Given its immense size, the blue whale has the largest heart of any animal. It can weigh between 400 to 600 kg (880 to 1,300 pounds) and be roughly the size of a small car or a golf cart. Its aorta (the main artery leaving the heart) is so large that a human child could crawl through it.
    *   **Elephant Heart:** An elephant's heart, while large compared to most animals, is significantly smaller than a blue whale's. It typically weighs between 12 to 21 kg (26 to 46 pounds) and is roughly the size of a basketball or a large watermelon.

4.  **Conclusion:** The blue whale's heart is hundreds of times heavier and vastly larger in dimensions than an elephant's heart.

**Final Answer:** No.
