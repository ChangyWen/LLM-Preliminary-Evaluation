*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this question. First, I need to figure out what "hotter" actually means in this context. Is it the average annual temperature, the peak summer temperature, or something else? Let's break it down.

Right off the bat, I know the Sahara is famous for scorching heat, a classic hot desert. The Gobi, on the other hand, is known for frigid winters. That gives me a solid starting point: geography and climate. The Sahara's in North Africa, a subtropical high-pressure zone. The Gobi's in Central Asia, the rain shadow of the Himalayas. Okay, so the Sahara's latitude is closer to the equator, so more direct sunlight, that's a critical factor.

My initial hunch is the Sahara is hotter overall, but the Gobi probably has some seriously impressive temperature swings. To confirm, I need specifics. I'm thinking summer temps for the Sahara regularly hit 40°C, sometimes exceeding that. El Azizia, Libya... there's that disputed record, but we're talking serious heat. The climate type? BWh, a hot desert. Key factors here are solar insolation and low humidity.

For the Gobi, I'm thinking a hot summer, maybe 35-40°C. But the winter? Brutal. -20°C, maybe colder. BWk - a cold desert. The continentality is a massive factor; it's far from any moderating oceans, and the rain shadow effect is keeping it dry.

Now for the comparison. The Sahara clearly wins on peak summer heat. It's routinely hotter and reaches higher absolute maximums. Average annual temperature? Sahara wins again, by a large margin. The Gobi's winter? That's where it gets interesting. The Gobi is a cold desert in winter. Its annual temperature range is enormous.

So, if "hotter" means average or peak summer temperature, the Sahara is definitely hotter. Given the common understanding of "hotter" when discussing deserts and extreme environments, I'm leaning towards the Sahara.

To give the answer, I'll say, **No, the Gobi isn't hotter than the Sahara.** Why? Well, the Sahara's in a lower latitude, and a higher solar insolation. Its summers are consistently warmer. The Gobi can get hot in summer, but crucially, its winters are brutally cold. That's the key differentiator and the reason why it is classified as a cold desert. The Sahara just experiences extreme heat, the Gobi experiences both heat *and* extreme cold. This reasoning is clear, accurate, and uses precise language.

No.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Understand the Deserts' Locations and Climates:**
    *   **Sahara Desert:** Located in North Africa, it spans a vast area and is classified primarily as a **subtropical hot desert**. It lies within the subtropical high-pressure belt, which leads to stable, dry, and hot conditions.
    *   **Gobi Desert:** Located in Central Asia (Mongolia and China), it is classified as a **cold desert**. It is much further north in latitude than the Sahara and is characterized by extreme continentality (far from moderating oceans) and a rain shadow effect from the Himalayas.

2.  **Compare Peak Summer Temperatures:**
    *   **Sahara:** Experiences some of the highest temperatures on Earth. Summer daytime temperatures routinely exceed 40°C (104°F) and often reach 45-50°C (113-122°F) or even higher in some areas. Record temperatures have approached 58°C (136.4°F), though some historical records are disputed, the general extreme heat is undeniable.
    *   **Gobi:** While its summers can be hot, reaching 35-40°C (95-104°F), these temperatures are generally not as consistently high or as extreme as those found in the Sahara.

3.  **Compare Winter Temperatures:**
    *   **Sahara:** Winters are generally mild to warm, with temperatures rarely dropping below freezing, even at night.
    *   **Gobi:** Winters are extremely cold, with temperatures frequently plummeting to -20°C (-4°F) to -30°C (-22°F) and sometimes even lower. This is a defining characteristic of a "cold desert."

4.  **Consider Overall Temperature Profile:**
    *   The Sahara is characterized by consistently high temperatures throughout much of the year, with extreme heat being its dominant feature.
    *   The Gobi experiences a much wider annual temperature range, with hot summers but extremely cold winters. While it can be hot in summer, its average annual temperature is significantly lower than the Sahara's due to the frigid winters.

**Final Answer:**

No. The Sahara Desert is generally hotter than the Gobi Desert, especially in terms of its peak summer temperatures and its overall average annual temperature. While the Gobi can experience hot summers, it is also known for its extremely cold winters, classifying it as a "cold desert," whereas the Sahara is a "hot desert."
