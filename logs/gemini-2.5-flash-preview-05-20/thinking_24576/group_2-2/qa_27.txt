*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this, putting myself in the "expert" seat.

Okay, the question is: "Is the boiling point of water lower than the melting point of ice?" Easy enough, but the prompt wants me to show my *work*. That's fine, I'll break it down step by step.

First, I need to *deconstruct* the question. "Is the boiling point of water lower than the melting point of ice?" and I have to show the steps and give a final Yes/No answer. No problem.

Now, it's time to *recall* the fundamental definitions and facts. We're talking about water under standard conditions, of course. The melting point of ice is the temperature at which solid water transitions to liquid water. That's *zero degrees Celsius*, or 32 Fahrenheit. And the boiling point of water is the temperature at which liquid water becomes steam. Under standard atmospheric pressure, that's *one hundred degrees Celsius*, or 212 Fahrenheit. *Important note*: We're explicitly referring to these standard values.

Next, I'll *compare* those values. Melting point is 0 °C. Boiling point is 100 °C.

Now I can *formulate* the comparison. Is 100 °C lower than 0 °C? Clearly not. 100 °C is much higher.

Alright, let's *construct* the step-by-step reasoning:

*   **Step 1: Identify the Melting Point of Ice.** That's 0 °C under standard atmospheric pressure.
*   **Step 2: Identify the Boiling Point of Water.** That's 100 °C, again under standard atmospheric pressure.
*   **Step 3: Compare the two temperatures.** 0 °C compared to 100 °C. 100 °C is greater.
*   **Step 4: Formulate the conclusion.** The question is, is the boiling point *lower* than the melting point?

Now, the *final answer*: Based on all that, the answer is "No."

Finally, I'll *review and refine*. Is it clear? Yep. Consistent units? Definitely. Does it answer the question and all its parts? Absolutely. Logical and easy to follow? I think so. Any ambiguities? Nope. And finally, a bit of *self-correction*: I could have just blurted out the answer, but the prompt *demands* the step-by-step process. It also pays to be explicitly clear on the standard conditions even though they're typically assumed.

Let's break down the boiling point of water and the melting point of ice.

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the Melting Point of Ice:** The melting point of ice is the temperature at which solid water (ice) transitions into liquid water. Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere), this temperature is **0 degrees Celsius (°C)** or 32 degrees Fahrenheit (°F).

2.  **Identify the Boiling Point of Water:** The boiling point of water is the temperature at which liquid water transitions into gaseous water (steam). Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere), this temperature is **100 degrees Celsius (°C)** or 212 degrees Fahrenheit (°F).

3.  **Compare the Temperatures:**
    *   Melting Point of Ice = 0 °C
    *   Boiling Point of Water = 100 °C

    Comparing these two values, 100 °C is clearly much higher than 0 °C.

4.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Since 100 °C is greater than 0 °C, the boiling point of water is *not* lower than the melting point of ice; it is significantly higher.

**Final Answer:**

No.
