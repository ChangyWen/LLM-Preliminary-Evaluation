*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this question, breaking it down step-by-step as I would in my head:

First, I need to understand exactly what the question is asking. It wants to know if Newton died *later* than Einstein. That's a straightforward temporal comparison. I need death dates.

Okay, Newton. 17th/18th century. I think I remember the date, but let's quickly verify, just to be certain. Ah, yes. March 31, 1727 (Gregorian calendar).

Now, Einstein. Definitely 20th century, relativity, the whole shebang. Again, death date, I *think* I know it. Quick mental check... Okay, April 18, 1955. Confirmed.

Now to compare. Newton: 1727. Einstein: 1955. Elementary. 1955 is *later* than 1727. The question is whether Newton died *later* than Einstein. Given what I've just established, Newton died *before* Einstein.

Therefore, the answer is unequivocally No.

Let's break down the death dates of both individuals:

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify Isaac Newton's death date:** Isaac Newton died on March 31, 1727.
2.  **Identify Albert Einstein's death date:** Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955.
3.  **Compare the two dates:**
    *   1727 (Newton's death)
    *   1955 (Einstein's death)
    *   1727 is clearly *earlier* than 1955.

Therefore, Isaac Newton died earlier than Albert Einstein.

**Final Answer:**

No
