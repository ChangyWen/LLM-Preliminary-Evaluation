Alright, here's how I'm going to tackle this question. First, I break down the prompt to really understand what's being asked. "Does Mars have more moons than Earth?" Okay, simple enough. But it wants the *reasoning* behind the answer, a step-by-step explanation, and then a clear "Yes" or "No".

Next, I tap into what I already know. Earth: one moon, just "the Moon". Mars: two moons, Phobos and Deimos. I've got the raw data I need.

Then comes the comparison. Earth has 1, Mars has 2. Clearly, 2 is greater than 1. Easy peasy.

To articulate this in a structured way, I'll break it down logically. Step 1: Earth has one moon. Step 2: Mars has two moons. Step 3: Compare those numbers – 2 versus 1. Step 4: Mars has more.

Finally, I formulate the answer. Mars has more moons, so the answer is "Yes."

Now I need to assemble the response so it's both clear and professional. I'll start with the facts, show the comparison, and finish with the definitive answer. I’m aiming for a concise, factual, and logically sound explanation.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Determine the number of natural satellites (moons) orbiting Earth:** Earth has one natural satellite, commonly known as "the Moon."
2.  **Determine the number of natural satellites (moons) orbiting Mars:** Mars has two natural satellites, named Phobos and Deimos.
3.  **Compare the number of moons for each planet:**
    *   Earth: 1 moon
    *   Mars: 2 moons
4.  **Evaluate the comparison:** Since 2 (Mars' moons) is greater than 1 (Earth's moon), Mars indeed has more moons than Earth.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
