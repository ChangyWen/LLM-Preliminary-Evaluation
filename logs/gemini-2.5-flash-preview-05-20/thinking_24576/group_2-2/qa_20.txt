*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's my thought process for answering this question, broken down as requested.

First, I have to understand what's being asked: "Is the atomic number of carbon higher than that of oxygen?" Seems simple enough on the surface, but it's important to clarify the request for a step-by-step explanation, which I'll have to provide. And of course, I need to arrive at a "Yes" or "No" answer.

Now, I need to retrieve the core knowledge. Atomic number is key here. I immediately think of the definition: the number of protons in an atom's nucleus, which uniquely identifies the element. The periodic table is the fundamental tool to find these atomic numbers, arranging elements in order of increasing atomic number.

So, the practical steps begin. I visualize the periodic table. I locate Carbon (C). Right above the symbol, I see the atomic number, which is 6. Carbon's atomic number is 6.

Next, I repeat the process for Oxygen (O). Oxygen's atomic number is 8.

Now the comparison: Carbon = 6, Oxygen = 8. Is 6 greater than 8? No, clearly not.

I need to structure this reasoning in a logical, step-by-step way. I'll break it down into these segments: Define the atomic number, then state Carbon's, then Oxygen's, then the comparison, and finally the conclusion.

Putting it all together, here's how I'd articulate it:

1.  **Definition:** The atomic number (Z) of an element is defined by the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element. This is what fundamentally defines the element.
2.  **Carbon's Atomic Number:** Carbon (C) has an atomic number of 6. From the periodic table, this is clear.
3.  **Oxygen's Atomic Number:** Oxygen (O) has an atomic number of 8. It's equally straightforward to look this up.
4.  **Comparison:** Comparing the atomic numbers, we have 6 (Carbon) versus 8 (Oxygen).
5.  **Conclusion:** Since 6 is not greater than 8, the atomic number of carbon is *not* higher than that of oxygen.

So, that takes care of the detailed reasoning.

**Final Answer:** No.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Understand Atomic Number:** The atomic number (Z) of an element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element. It uniquely identifies an element and determines its position on the periodic table. Elements are arranged in increasing order of their atomic number on the periodic table.

2.  **Identify the Atomic Number of Carbon:** By consulting the periodic table, the element Carbon (C) has an atomic number of **6**. This means a carbon atom has 6 protons.

3.  **Identify the Atomic Number of Oxygen:** By consulting the periodic table, the element Oxygen (O) has an atomic number of **8**. This means an oxygen atom has 8 protons.

4.  **Compare the Atomic Numbers:**
    *   Atomic number of Carbon = 6
    *   Atomic number of Oxygen = 8
    Comparing 6 and 8, we see that 6 is less than 8.

5.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Since 6 is not higher than 8, the atomic number of carbon is not higher than that of oxygen.

**Final Answer:** No.
