*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'm tackling this geographical query. First, I break down the question: "Is the Dal-Tex Building, TX south of Lake Martin, AL?" My approach will be a clear, methodical one to ensure accuracy.

First, I need to know *where* we're talking about. The Dal-Tex Building immediately screams "Dallas, Texas" to me, thanks to its historical significance. A quick mental confirmation (or a quick search, depending on the stakes) confirms the location. I'm envisioning the Kennedy assassination already! Knowing Dallas is in North Texas, I now think about its approximate latitude, around 32.78° N.

Next, Lake Martin. My mental database places this squarely in Alabama. Similar to Dallas, I picture its location and consider the surrounding area. My focus shifts to the latitude, and my internal compass directs me towards an approximate latitude of ~32.75° N.

Now, the crucial step: "south of". This means comparing latitudes. A lower latitude implies a location further south, closer to the equator. Comparing those two latitudes, ~32.78° N (Dallas) versus ~32.75° N (Lake Martin), gives me my answer. Since Lake Martin's latitude is *lower*, Lake Martin is south of Dallas.

Therefore, if Lake Martin is south of the Dal-Tex Building, then the Dal-Tex Building *cannot* be south of Lake Martin. So, the answer is No.

Let me be clear with my steps:

1.  **Identify locations:** Dal-Tex Building = Dallas, TX; Lake Martin = East-Central Alabama.
2.  **Determine approximate latitudes:** Dallas, ~32.78° N; Lake Martin, ~32.75° N.
3.  **Compare latitudes:** Dallas's latitude is higher than Lake Martin's.
4.  **Determine relative position:** Lake Martin is south of Dallas. Thus, the Dal-Tex Building is *north* of Lake Martin.
5.  **Answer the Question:** No, the Dal-Tex Building is not south of Lake Martin.

Finally, I do a quick mental double-check. Are my general estimations of the locations and the latitudes sound? Is my understanding of "south of" correct? Does my final answer align directly with the question? Yes, everything checks out. The similarity of their latitudes really makes this an interesting question, requiring precise knowledge and a bit of nuanced understanding of geography.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step-by-step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the precise location of the Dal-Tex Building, TX:**
    The Dal-Tex Building is located in Dallas, Texas. Its approximate latitude is **32.78° N**.

2.  **Identify the precise location of Lake Martin, AL:**
    Lake Martin is located in east-central Alabama. Its approximate latitude is **32.75° N**.

3.  **Understand the definition of "south of" in geographical terms:**
    A location is considered "south of" another if its latitude is *lower* (closer to the equator).

4.  **Compare the latitudes:**
    *   Dal-Tex Building (Dallas, TX): 32.78° N
    *   Lake Martin, AL: 32.75° N

    Since 32.75° N (Lake Martin) is *lower* than 32.78° N (Dal-Tex Building), Lake Martin is geographically south of the Dal-Tex Building.

5.  **Determine the relative position based on the question:**
    The question asks: "Is Dal-Tex Building, TX located south of Lake Martin, AL?"
    Because Lake Martin is south of the Dal-Tex Building, it means the Dal-Tex Building is *north* of Lake Martin.

**Final Answer:**

No
