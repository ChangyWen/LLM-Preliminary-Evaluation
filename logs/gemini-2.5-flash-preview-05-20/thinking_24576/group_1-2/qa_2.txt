*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here’s how I'm tackling this release date question. My goal is to figure out if *Catching Fire* came out later than *Summertime*. I'm approaching this methodically.

First, I need to nail down the release dates for both books. *Catching Fire* is the obvious first step, so I'll search for "Catching Fire release date". Quick check... August 2009. Got it.

Next up, *Summertime*. Let's see, "J. M. Coetzee Summertime release date". That's returning September 2009 for the UK and January 2010 for the US. Okay, so two possibilities there.

Now for the comparison. *Catching Fire* came out in August 2009. *Summertime* was released in September 2009 in the UK, and January 2010 in the US.

Therefore, *Catching Fire* was released *before* *Summertime* in both the UK and US. The question asks if *Catching Fire* was released *later* than *Summertime*. Since *Catching Fire* was released earlier, the answer is: No.
