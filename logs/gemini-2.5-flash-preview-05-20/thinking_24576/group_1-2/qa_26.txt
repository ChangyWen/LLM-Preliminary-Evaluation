*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'm approaching this. First, I need to figure out if the Oregon ZIP code 97233 is west of the Washington ZIP code 98580. My process will be to determine the geographic coordinates of each ZIP code and then compare their longitudes.

I know that "west of" is all about longitude. The smaller (more negative) the longitude, the further west you are.

My mental model, trained from years of analyzing geographical data, kicks in.  I know 97233 is in Portland, Oregon. Portland is near the coast, so its longitude will be around -122.6 to -122.7. I quickly check my internal knowledge base, cross-referencing this with my understanding.  Okay, confirmed. 97233 is in southeast Portland, approximately 45.47° N, -122.58° W.

Now, for 98580, which is in Washington state. I immediately recall that 98580 is in Shelton, Washington.  Shelton is on the Olympic Peninsula, west of Olympia.  Again, I cross-reference with my internal knowledge. I've got it, the approximate centroid is around 47.21° N, -123.10° W.

Time to compare the longitudes: 97233 is roughly -122.58° W, and 98580 is roughly -123.10° W.  -123.10 is more negative than -122.58. Therefore, 98580 is further west.

So, my answer is this:  First, I established the locations and coordinates.  97233 in Portland, Oregon, has an approximate center at 45.47° N, -122.58° W.  98580, in Shelton, Washington, is around 47.21° N, -123.10° W.  Then I compared the longitudes.  Since -123.10 is more negative than -122.58, 98580 is west of 97233.  Therefore, the answer is **No**.

To determine if 97233, OR is located west of 98580, WA, we need to compare their longitudes. In the Western Hemisphere, a more negative longitude value indicates a location further west.

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the approximate geographic coordinates (specifically longitude) for each ZIP code:**
    *   **97233, OR:** This ZIP code is located in Southeast Portland, Oregon. Its approximate geographic center is around **-122.58° W** longitude.
    *   **98580, WA:** This ZIP code is located in Shelton, Washington. Its approximate geographic center is around **-123.10° W** longitude.

2.  **Compare the longitudes:**
    *   Longitude of 97233, OR: -122.58° W
    *   Longitude of 98580, WA: -123.10° W

3.  **Determine which location is further west:**
    *   A more negative longitude means further west.
    *   Comparing -122.58 and -123.10, we see that -123.10 is a smaller (more negative) number than -122.58.
    *   Therefore, 98580, WA is geographically further west than 97233, OR.

**Final Answer:**

No.
