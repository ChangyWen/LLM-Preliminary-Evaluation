*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this question, "Is Lake Vico located west of Pragser Wildsee?":

First things first, I break down the prompt. I see two key locations, Lake Vico and Pragser Wildsee, and the relationship I need to establish: "west of." The goal is clear – to provide a logical, step-by-step process, and then definitively say "Yes" or "No." This calls for geographic knowledge and a methodical approach.

The most reliable strategy here is to leverage geographical coordinates, specifically longitudes. "West of" translates directly to having a *smaller* longitude value. So, I need to compare the longitudes of these two lakes.

Next, I need to gather the necessary data. I'd head straight to a reliable source for geographical information – a trusted database or a quick search with precise phrasing. I know generally where these lakes are, but precision is critical. I'd search for the coordinates of Lake Vico and get approximately 42.33° N, 12.17° E. Then I'd do the same for Pragser Wildsee (Lake Braies) and get approximately 46.69° N, 12.08° E.

Now for the analysis. I lay out the longitudes side-by-side: Lake Vico at about 12.17° E and Pragser Wildsee at about 12.08° E. Time for the key comparison: is 12.17° E less than 12.08° E? No, it's not. This means Lake Vico's longitude is *greater* than Pragser Wildsee's.  Therefore, Lake Vico is actually further *east* than Pragser Wildsee.

To summarize, here's how I formulated the logic:

1.  Find the longitude of Lake Vico.
2.  Find the longitude of Pragser Wildsee.
3.  Compare the two longitudes.
4.  Determine relative east/west positioning based on the comparison.

My final answer is: No.

Finally, I'd do a quick internal check.  Does this result intuitively make sense? Lake Vico is in central Italy, and Pragser Wildsee is in the northeastern Dolomites. A mental map of Italy puts Lake Vico *east* of Pragser Wildsee, which supports the answer. The latitude difference also supports the conclusion. This methodical approach, ensuring accuracy in the data and a logical framework, always gives me confidence in the final result.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if Lake Vico is located west of Pragser Wildsee, we need to compare their geographical longitudes.

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the approximate geographical coordinates for Lake Vico:**
    *   Lake Vico is located in Lazio, central Italy.
    *   Approximate Longitude: ~12.17° E

2.  **Identify the approximate geographical coordinates for Pragser Wildsee (Lake Braies):**
    *   Pragser Wildsee is located in South Tyrol, northern Italy (Dolomites).
    *   Approximate Longitude: ~12.08° E

3.  **Compare the longitudes:**
    *   Lake Vico Longitude: 12.17° E
    *   Pragser Wildsee Longitude: 12.08° E

    For a location to be "west of" another, its longitude must be *smaller* (further west on the globe, assuming both are in the Eastern Hemisphere).

    In this case, 12.17° E is *greater than* 12.08° E.

4.  **Conclusion based on comparison:**
    Since Lake Vico's longitude (12.17° E) is greater than Pragser Wildsee's longitude (12.08° E), Lake Vico is actually located *east* of Pragser Wildsee, not west.

**Final Answer:**

No
