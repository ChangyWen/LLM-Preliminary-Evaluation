*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's my thought process: The user wants to know if Cattaraugus County, NY, is west of Cambria County, PA. Simple question, but it requires a systematic approach for accuracy.

First, I need to get my bearings. I'd instantly think about pulling up a map, but let's do this methodically using what I know. The core of this question hinges on comparing longitude. The mental map might be tempting, but it is too prone to error. I'll use geographic coordinates.

So, step one: I need the approximate longitude of each county. I'll search for the coordinates, focusing on the center of each county for an initial comparison, and then I need to look at their range.

Okay, a quick search gives me that Cattaraugus is roughly centered around 78.75° W, with a range from about 78.5° W to 79.2° W. And Cambria is also about 78.75° W, again with a range from about 78.5°W to 79.0° W. Hmm, that's close. Their centers are practically on the same line of longitude.

Now I need to be precise, so I have to consider the extent of each county. Both counties have approximately the same eastern longitude. Cattaraugus's *western* edge extends slightly further west than Cambria's. But I need to think through the implication of that. "West of" means Cattaraugus *as a whole* should be west of Cambria, at least its center.

If I were to map this out, I'd draw them on a vertical line. This is why I have to use coordinate ranges, as if you do not, and just use the center, you will be wrong. Now, looking at the extents, Cattaraugus is not entirely west of Cambria, because its eastern boundary is nearly the same longitude as Cambria's.

Therefore, because their centers are at the same longitude, and their eastern boundaries are aligned, and because their westernmost lines intersect, the answer is no. Cattaraugus County, NY, is *not* west of Cambria County, PA.

To determine if Cattaraugus County, NY is located west of Cambria County, PA, we need to compare their longitudinal positions. Westward locations have lower (more negative) longitudes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **Identify the approximate geographic coordinates (specifically longitude) for Cattaraugus County, NY.**
    *   Cattaraugus County, NY, is located in southwestern New York. Its approximate central longitude is around **78.75° West**. Its longitudinal extent ranges roughly from 78.5°W to 79.2°W.

2.  **Identify the approximate geographic coordinates (specifically longitude) for Cambria County, PA.**
    *   Cambria County, PA, is located in west-central Pennsylvania. Its approximate central longitude is also around **78.75° West**. Its longitudinal extent ranges roughly from 78.5°W to 79.0°W.

3.  **Compare the longitudes.**
    *   Both counties have very similar central longitudes, indicating they are largely aligned along the same north-south axis.
    *   While Cattaraugus County's westernmost point (around 79.2°W) extends slightly further west than Cambria County's westernmost point (around 79.0°W), their eastern borders are at roughly the same longitude (around 78.5°W).
    *   For one county to be considered "west of" another, its entire extent or at least its center should be significantly to the west. In this case, there is substantial longitudinal overlap, and their centers are almost identical.

**Conclusion:**
Cattaraugus County, NY, is primarily located *north* of Cambria County, PA, but they are largely aligned along the same longitudinal band. Neither county is distinctly "west of" the other in a general geographical sense.

**Final Answer:** No
