*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this. The question is a straightforward comparison of death dates: William de Warenne versus Agnes of Aquitaine.

First, I need the death dates. My mind immediately goes to my internal knowledge base. I know William de Warenne, the 1st Earl of Surrey – prominent Norman figure, fought at Hastings. His death is around **1088**. I can pull that easily.

Then, Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy. Hmm... Daughter of William IX of Aquitaine, of course. She married Amadeus III of Savoy. Much later period. Her death is generally cited as **1159**.

Next, I'll do a simple comparison. 1088 versus 1159. 1159 is the later date, obviously.

Now, to break down the process: I identified each person and their death dates. I then compared the dates to determine who died later.

I have to double-check quickly. Are we talking about the *right* William de Warenne and the correct Agnes of Aquitaine? Yes. The titles are specific enough. And are the dates standard historical knowledge? Yes, those dates are widely accepted.

So, does William de Warenne die later? No. Agnes did. And that’s the final answer I’ll formulate. It's all pretty clear-cut.
