Alright, here's how I'm breaking down this geographical comparison. First things first: the question is asking about relative *east-west* positions, specifically if Hunters Point S Park Playground in Queens is east of the Red Balloon Learning Center in Manhattan. Clear enough.

My brain immediately goes to: I need precise coordinates, specifically longitude. Latitude is irrelevant for this particular question.

To get the data, I'll rely on a reliable geocoding source, probably Google Maps or something similar. I'll search for each location individually.

So, step one: "Hunters Point S Park Playground, Queens". Okay, got the address and, importantly, the coordinates: approximately 40.7439° N, 73.9530° W. Good. Verified it's in Queens, too.

Next up: "Red Balloon Learning Center, Manhattan". Found it: address, and the coordinates: approximately 40.7920° N, 73.9460° W. Confirmed Manhattan.

Now comes the critical step: the longitude comparison. Hunters Point is at -73.9530, and Red Balloon is at -73.9460. Remember, the smaller the *absolute value* of the West longitude, the further east the location.

Therefore, Red Balloon is east of Hunters Point. The question is the other way around, so, Hunters Point is *not* east of Red Balloon.

Putting it all together in the explanation: Find the coordinates, compare the longitudes, and interpret "east of" in terms of longitude.

The answer, therefore, is a clear "No." Hunters Point S Park Playground is west of Red Balloon Learning Center.

To determine if HUNTERS POINT S PARK PLAYGROUND, Queens is located east of RED BALLOON LEARNING CENTER, Manhattan, we need to find the geographical coordinates (specifically, the longitude) of both locations and compare them.

**Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1.  **Find the coordinates of HUNTERS POINT S PARK PLAYGROUND, Queens:**
    *   Using a mapping service, the approximate coordinates for Hunters Point South Park Playground (located within Hunters Point South Park) are:
        *   Latitude: 40.7439° N
        *   Longitude: **73.9530° W**

2.  **Find the coordinates of RED BALLOON LEARNING CENTER, Manhattan:**
    *   Using a mapping service, the approximate coordinates for Red Balloon Learning Center at 170 E 106th St, New York, NY 10029 are:
        *   Latitude: 40.7920° N
        *   Longitude: **73.9460° W**

3.  **Compare the longitudes:**
    *   Hunters Point S Park Playground: 73.9530° W
    *   Red Balloon Learning Center: 73.9460° W

    In the Western Hemisphere, a smaller absolute longitude value (closer to 0°) means the location is further east.
    *   73.9460 is less than 73.9530.
    *   Therefore, Red Balloon Learning Center (73.9460° W) is located *east* of Hunters Point S Park Playground (73.9530° W).
    *   Conversely, Hunters Point S Park Playground is located *west* of Red Balloon Learning Center.

**Final Answer:**

No
