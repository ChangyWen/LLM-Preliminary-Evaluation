Okay, here's how I'm going to approach this. The user wants to know if the Ort Institute in Illinois is west of the University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan. Simple enough.

First, I need to clarify my understanding of the question. The core of it is determining relative east-west positions. I know that means I'm going to need to compare the longitudes of the two locations. West is defined by a more negative longitude.

Now, let's get down to brass tacks. I'll start with the Ort Institute in Illinois. I'm going to assume they mean the ORT Technical Institute, likely in Skokie, IL. That's the most likely scenario. I’ll search for "Skokie, IL coordinates" to get its longitude.

Next, I need the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan's location. I'll quickly search for "Sheboygan, WI coordinates".

With those coordinates, I'll be able to compare the longitudes. I will meticulously document the approximate values of each to make sure I can trace the steps. I'll then check which one has the more negative longitude. That'll tell me which is further west.

I will formulate a step-by-step process, explaining what I did. I will begin by defining the locations and then listing the coordinates, followed by the comparison of the two longitudes to arrive at the final result.

Finally, I'll double-check my assumptions, specifically the location of the Ort Institute, to make sure everything is sound. My initial thought is that Skokie is a very reasonable assumption, and a quick visual check on a map will confirm that Skokie is indeed west of Sheboygan. Given the numbers, Skokie is to the west, though the locations are practically adjacent. That's the beauty of using longitude to get that answer. And after all that, I'll provide my final, definitive answer.

To determine if The Ort Institute, IL is located west of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI, we need to compare their longitudes. A location is west of another if its longitude is numerically smaller (more negative when using West longitudes, or further west on a map).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **Identify the specific locations:**
    *   **The Ort Institute, IL:** This typically refers to the ORT Technical Institute, which has a prominent campus in **Skokie, Illinois**.
    *   **University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI:** This institution is located in **Sheboygan, Wisconsin**.

2.  **Obtain the approximate geographic coordinates (specifically longitude) for each location:**
    *   **Skokie, Illinois:**
        *   Latitude: Approximately 42.03° N
        *   Longitude: Approximately **87.74° W**
    *   **Sheboygan, Wisconsin:**
        *   Latitude: Approximately 43.75° N
        *   Longitude: Approximately **87.71° W**

3.  **Compare the longitudes:**
    *   Longitude of Skokie, IL: -87.74° W
    *   Longitude of Sheboygan, WI: -87.71° W

4.  **Determine the relative west/east position:**
    *   On a longitude scale, a more negative number (or a larger number when expressed as "W") indicates a location further west.
    *   Comparing -87.74 and -87.71, -87.74 is numerically smaller (more negative) than -87.71.
    *   Therefore, Skokie, Illinois, is located west of Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

**Final Answer:** Yes
