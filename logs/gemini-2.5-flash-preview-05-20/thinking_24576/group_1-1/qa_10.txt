*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's my thought process in answering this question. First, I need to figure out if "Jimmy James" came out before "Pull Me Under." That means I need release dates. No problem.

My brain, trained on a vast corpus of music information, immediately kicks into gear. I know, off the top of my head, that "Jimmy James" is from the Beastie Boys album *Check Your Head*. *Check Your Head* came out in 1992. That's a good starting point.

Next, "Pull Me Under"... Ah, yes. That's Dream Theater. I know that's from *Awake*. And *Awake* was released in 1994. Good. I've got my key data points.

Now for the comparison: 1992 (Beastie Boys) versus 1994 (Dream Theater). Obviously, 1992 is earlier. So, "Jimmy James," being on *Check Your Head* which came out in 1992, was indeed released before "Pull Me Under" which was on *Awake* and came out in 1994.

Here's how I'd present this to the user:

*   **Step 1: Identify Release Date for Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James".** "Jimmy James" is on the album *Check Your Head*, which was released on April 21, 1992.
*   **Step 2: Identify Release Date for Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under".** "Pull Me Under" is from the album *Awake*, which was released on October 4, 1994.
*   **Step 3: Compare the Release Dates.** April 21, 1992 (Jimmy James) versus October 4, 1994 (Pull Me Under). 1992 is earlier than 1994.
*   **Final Answer:** Yes. "Jimmy James" was released earlier.
