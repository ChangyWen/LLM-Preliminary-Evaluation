*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this. First, I need to understand what's being asked: is Agnes of Aquitaine's death later than William de Warenne's? Simple enough. Now, the key is knowing the dates.

I'd start with Agnes. *Agnes of Aquitaine... Countess of Savoy*. That name rings a bell â€“ definitely connected to a major royal family, possibly the House of Savoy, which suggests connections to French nobility. Right, I'll quickly pull up her death date. Hmm... a quick search (or, knowing my history, my brain filing it) should give me... yes, she died in **1159**.

Next, *William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey*. Warene... a key figure in Norman England. My mind immediately goes to the Norman Conquest and the immediate aftermath. He was a prominent figure. Okay, let's get his death date. He died in... **1088**.

Now I just need to compare: Agnes in 1159, William in 1088. Did she die *later*? Yes, 1159 is after 1088.

So, to summarize my reasoning, I would:
1.  Find Agnes's death date.
2.  Find William's death date.
3.  Compare the dates to see if Agnes died later.

And the answer is clearly **Yes**.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1.  **Identify the death date of Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy:** Historical records indicate that Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy (daughter of William IX, Duke of Aquitaine, and wife of Aimone, Count of Savoy) died in **1159**.
2.  **Identify the death date of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey:** Historical records indicate that William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, died in **1088**.
3.  **Compare the two death dates:**
    *   Agnes of Aquitaine: 1159
    *   William de Warenne: 1088
    Since 1159 is later than 1088, Agnes of Aquitaine died later than William de Warenne.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
