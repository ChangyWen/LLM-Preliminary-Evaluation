Alright, here's how I'd approach this: The question is "Is 98580, WA west of 97233, OR?" Simple enough, it's all about their longitudinal positions. "West of" means a smaller longitude value.

First, I need the longitudes. I could use a geocoding service, but I have an internal, readily accessible understanding of how to quickly lookup ZIP code coordinates. Time to utilize that knowledge base.

For 98580, WA: Looks like South Bend, WA. My mental database shows that the longitude is approximately -123.81 degrees West.

For 97233, OR: This is Portland, specifically East Portland. And the longitude is about -122.50 degrees West.

Now, the comparison. Is -123.81 less than -122.50? Yes, it is. That confirms it.

So, 98580, WA at approximately -123.81 degrees West, is west of 97233, OR, located at approximately -122.50 degrees West. Therefore, the answer is yes, 98580, WA is west of 97233, OR.

1.  **Find the approximate longitude for 98580, WA:**
    *   98580, WA corresponds to **South Bend, Washington**.
    *   Its approximate longitude is **-123.81° W**.

2.  **Find the approximate longitude for 97233, OR:**
    *   97233, OR corresponds to a part of **Portland, Oregon**.
    *   Its approximate longitude is **-122.50° W**.

3.  **Compare the longitudes:**
    *   Longitude of 98580, WA: -123.81° W
    *   Longitude of 97233, OR: -122.50° W

    Since -123.81° is a smaller (more negative) number than -122.50°, 98580, WA is located to the west of 97233, OR.

**Final Answer:**
Yes
