*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this. The question is straight-forward: Was Yao Shu born *before* Alfonso of Molina? Simple comparison of birth dates.

First, I need to nail down those dates. That means a quick dive into the relevant biographical information. I'd immediately formulate a search strategy: "Yao Shu birth date" and "Alfonso of Molina birth date" would be my bread and butter terms. We're aiming for *years* here, maybe full dates if the initial search doesn't give a clear picture.

Okay, based on my existing knowledge and a quick mental scan of well-known historical figures – I'm picturing 1201 for Yao Shu, and probably around 1202 for Alfonso of Molina. But, let's verify.

I've got the dates now: Yao Shu in 1201, and Alfonso of Molina in 1202.

Now, the easy part: comparing. 1201 versus 1202. Obviously, 1201 comes *before* 1202. Numerical comparison is key.

Therefore, I've got my conclusion. Yao Shu, born in 1201, *was* indeed born earlier than Alfonso of Molina, born in 1202. The answer is a definite yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if Yao Shu was born earlier than Alfonso of Molina, we need to find their birth years:

1.  **Find Yao Shu's birth year:** Yao Shu (姚樞) was born in **1201**.
2.  **Find Alfonso of Molina's birth year:** Alfonso of Molina (Alfonso de Molina) was born in **1202**.

**Comparison:**
*   Yao Shu: 1201
*   Alfonso of Molina: 1202

Since 1201 comes before 1202, Yao Shu was born earlier.

**Final Answer:** Yes
