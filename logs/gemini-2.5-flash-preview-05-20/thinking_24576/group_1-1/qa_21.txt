*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's my thought process: The question's asking about the relative locations of essentially the same geographical entity, the Sangre de Cristo range, but with slightly different phrasing. My goal is a definitive "yes" or "no" answer, and I need to outline my reasoning meticulously.

First, I break down the core issue. It's a comparison of "Range" versus "Mountains," both with the "CO" qualifier, so focusing my efforts on that aspect.

Instinctively, I know "Sangre de Cristo" is a major range, and the "Range" and "Mountains" labels are often interchangeable. However, I must verify this, and I can't just rely on intuition here, as a wrong assumption will lead to an incorrect answer.

My verification strategy involves a multi-pronged approach. I'll start by defining the terms, trying to ascertain any subtle distinctions. Then I need to check geographical scope: does one term refer to a part or the entirety of the named geographical feature? And of course, consulting authorities like the USGS is crucial.

Then, the actual work begins. I'll pull up USGS data, Wikipedia, and other reliable geographical resources. The results, I anticipate, will show that both terms describe the same physical entity â€“ the Sangre de Cristo range. The "CO" suffix is simply a geographical constraint.

With this understanding, answering the core question is straightforward. If the features are the same, one cannot be east of the other, geographically.

Finally, I'll structure my reasoning clearly, laying out each step: clarifying the terms, consulting authoritative sources, analyzing the findings, and applying the conclusions to the question.

The ultimate answer is unequivocally "No." It's a simple question when the fundamental geographic relationship is well-established. I need to be methodical to demonstrate the reasoning even though the conclusion is relatively simple.

Let's break this down:

**Step-by-step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand the Terminology:** In geography, the terms "range" and "mountains" are often used interchangeably to refer to a chain or group of mountains.
2.  **Identify the Specific Feature:** "Sangre de Cristo Range" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" both refer to the *same* major mountain chain that extends from southern Colorado into northern New Mexico.
3.  **Consider the "CO" Qualifier:** Adding "CO" (Colorado) simply specifies the portion of this single, continuous mountain chain that lies within the state of Colorado.
4.  **Compare the Locations:** Since "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" are two different ways of referring to the *exact same geographical feature* (the Colorado portion of the Sangre de Cristo mountain chain), one cannot be located geographically east of the other. They occupy the same space.

**Final Answer:**

No
