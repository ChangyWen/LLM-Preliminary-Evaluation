Okay, here's how I'd approach this. The user wants to know if Cambria County, PA is west of Cattaraugus County, NY. Simple enough. My brain immediately goes to comparing longitudes – that's the quickest way to determine east/west positioning.

First, I need the longitude ranges for both counties. I'd mentally "search" or quickly retrieve from my knowledge base, starting with Cambria County, PA. I know it's in central/western Pennsylvania, and Johnstown is a key city there. Time to "look up" or recall roughly where it sits – it's around 78.9°W to 78.4°W, give or take. Let's confirm that...Yep, I'm confident with that range.

Next, Cattaraugus County, NY. Southwestern New York, right near the Pennsylvania border. Olean is a city to keep in mind. I'd "search" and "recall" here too. Okay, around 79.2°W to 78.3°W seems right. Let's confirm with a quick check...Yep, that looks correct.

Now for the comparison: Cambria's roughly 78.9°W to 78.4°W, and Cattaraugus is 79.2°W to 78.3°W.

If I visualize this on a number line, (remembering West is to the bigger/more negative longitude number), Cattaraugus County definitely extends further west (79.2°W). Crucially, Cattaraugus's westernmost point is *west* of Cambria’s westernmost point. And also, a chunk of Cattaraugus (the eastern part) is *east* of a chunk of Cambria. So, there is overlap and, the key thing is Cattaraugus has a bit of itself further West than Cambria.

So, the answer's "No."

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1.  I'm going to determine east-west position by comparing longitudes.
2.  Cambria County, PA spans approximately 78.9°W to 78.4°W.
3.  Cattaraugus County, NY spans approximately 79.2°W to 78.3°W.
4.  Comparing those ranges, the westernmost part of Cattaraugus is *west* of the westernmost part of Cambria. There's overlap.
5.  Therefore, it is not true that Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County.

Final Answer: **No.**

Let's break this down by looking at the approximate longitudinal positions of each county.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1.  **Identify Cambria County, PA's Longitude:** Cambria County is located in west-central Pennsylvania. Its approximate longitude range is from about **78.9° West to 78.4° West**. (Johnstown, a major city in Cambria County, is around 78.9°W).

2.  **Identify Cattaraugus County, NY's Longitude:** Cattaraugus County is located in southwestern New York, bordering Pennsylvania. Its approximate longitude range is from about **79.2° West to 78.3° West**. (Olean, a major city in Cattaraugus County, is around 78.4°W, but the county extends further west).

3.  **Compare the Longitude Ranges:**
    *   Cambria County: 78.9°W (westernmost) to 78.4°W (easternmost)
    *   Cattaraugus County: 79.2°W (westernmost) to 78.3°W (easternmost)

    When comparing longitudes, a higher West degree number means further west.
    *   The westernmost point of Cattaraugus County (79.2°W) is *west* of the westernmost point of Cambria County (78.9°W).
    *   There is significant overlap between the two counties' longitudes. For example, both counties cover the longitude of approximately 78.5°W.
    *   Cattaraugus County extends further west than Cambria County.

4.  **Conclusion:** Since Cattaraugus County extends further west than Cambria County, and a significant portion of Cattaraugus County is west of Cambria County, it is not true that Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County.

**Final Answer:**

No
