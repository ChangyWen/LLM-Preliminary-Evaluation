*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'm going to approach this question: "Is Pragser Wildsee located west of Lake Vico?"

First, I need to break down the question. The core task is a comparison: are we looking at something "west of" something else? To do that correctly, I know I'll need a clear, step-by-step reasoning, ending with a definitive "Yes" or "No" answer.

My strategy is clear: I'll go for the most reliable method – using coordinates. Longitude is key here; the lower the longitude, the further west.

Now for the data.  I'll simulate a search, starting with "Pragser Wildsee coordinates," also known as Lake Braies, and then "Lake Vico coordinates." I'll get their approximate locations.

*   **Pragser Wildsee:** The search will likely yield something like ~46.69° N, 12.08° E.
*   **Lake Vico:** Then, I'll search for this location as well. I expect to find something like ~42.33° N, 12.17° E.

Next comes the analysis. I have the longitudes now: Pragser Wildsee at approximately 12.08° E, and Lake Vico at approximately 12.17° E.  Since 12.08° E is smaller than 12.17° E, Pragser Wildsee has a lower longitude.  Therefore, Pragser Wildsee is, in fact, west of Lake Vico.

Now, I'll organize the steps precisely, just to ensure the result is properly justified:

*   **Step 1:** Get the coordinates of Pragser Wildsee (Lake Braies) - about 46.69° N, 12.08° E.
*   **Step 2:** Find the coordinates of Lake Vico - about 42.33° N, 12.17° E.
*   **Step 3:** Compare the longitudes: Pragser Wildsee at 12.08° E, Lake Vico at 12.17° E.
*   **Step 4:** Recognize the relationship of longitude to east/west: smaller longitude means further west. So Pragser Wildsee, with its smaller longitude, is west of Lake Vico.

And finally:

*   **Final Answer:** Yes.

And finally, I'll check:

*   Are the coordinates precise enough? Absolutely, for this type of comparison.
*   Is the reasoning clear? Yes.
*   Does it directly answer the question? Yes, definitely.

To determine if Pragser Wildsee is located west of Lake Vico, we need to compare their longitudes. A location is west of another if its longitude is smaller (assuming both are in the same hemisphere, which they are, both being in the Eastern Hemisphere).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Identify the geographical coordinates for Pragser Wildsee (Lake Braies):**
    *   Pragser Wildsee is located in South Tyrol, Italy.
    *   Approximate coordinates: **46.69° N, 12.08° E**

2.  **Identify the geographical coordinates for Lake Vico (Lago di Vico):**
    *   Lake Vico is located in Lazio, Italy.
    *   Approximate coordinates: **42.33° N, 12.17° E**

3.  **Compare the longitudes of the two locations:**
    *   Longitude of Pragser Wildsee: **12.08° E**
    *   Longitude of Lake Vico: **12.17° E**

4.  **Determine the relative west/east position:**
    *   Since 12.08° E (Pragser Wildsee) is a smaller longitude value than 12.17° E (Lake Vico), Pragser Wildsee is located to the west of Lake Vico.

**Final Answer:** Yes
