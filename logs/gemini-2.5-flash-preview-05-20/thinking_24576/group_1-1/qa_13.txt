*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's my thought process: The user wants to know if Garnavillo, IA is east of Newellton, LA. Pretty straightforward geographic comparison.

First, I need to nail down a clear approach.  To figure out "east of," I need to compare longitudes. The core idea is that a location further east will have a larger longitude value, or, more precisely, a longitude closer to zero or positive (or less negative if thinking -180 to +180). Since we're dealing with the US, both will likely be West longitudes.

The plan is: Get the coordinates for each location.  Then, compare the longitudes.

Okay, time to get those coordinates. I'll use a quick search - "Garnavillo, IA coordinates" and "Newellton, LA coordinates."  I expect common results, probably rounded.

Now, let's compare: Garnavillo's longitude is 91.20° W, and Newellton's is 91.20° W. Huh. They're identical!  That changes things a bit.

Since they have the same longitude, they're on the same north-south line.  That means one isn't *east* of the other; they're directly north or south of each other.

So, let's summarize the steps for the user: 1) Get Garnavillo's coordinates, 2) Get Newellton's coordinates, 3) Compare the longitudes, and 4) Check if Garnavillo's longitude is greater (more east) than Newellton's.

Based on the comparison, the answer has to be "No". Garnavillo isn't east of Newellton, it's on the same meridian.

Just to be certain, does it make sense to have matching longitudes? Yes, absolutely. It's the same north-south line. Since the question asks "east of" and they're on the same line, the answer remains a definite "No".

To determine if Garnavillo, IA is located east of Newellton, LA, we need to compare their longitudes. A location is "east of" another if its longitude value is numerically smaller (when expressed as West longitude, e.g., 90° W is east of 100° W) or numerically larger (when expressed as positive/negative longitude, e.g., -90° is east of -100°).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Find the geographic coordinates for Garnavillo, IA:**
    *   Latitude: Approximately 42.85° N
    *   Longitude: Approximately 91.20° W

2.  **Find the geographic coordinates for Newellton, LA:**
    *   Latitude: Approximately 31.95° N
    *   Longitude: Approximately 91.20° W

3.  **Compare the longitudes:**
    *   Garnavillo, IA longitude: 91.20° W
    *   Newellton, LA longitude: 91.20° W

4.  **Determine the relative position:**
    Since both locations have the exact same longitude (91.20° W), they lie on the same north-south line (meridian). Therefore, one cannot be "east of" the other; they are directly north/south of each other.

**Final Answer:**

No
