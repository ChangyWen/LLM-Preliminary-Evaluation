*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's get this done. The user wants to know if gravity on the Moon is less than on Earth, with a step-by-step explanation. Alright, here's how I'll break it down in my mind:

1.  **The Core Question:**  First, I need to confirm I understand what's being asked: is the acceleration due to gravity ($g$) on the Moon less than on Earth? Simple enough. And they want a "Yes/No" answer at the end, plus the reasoning.

2.  **Recall the Basics:**  Right, the key here is that $g = \frac{GM}{R^2}$.  $G$ is a constant. $M$ is the mass of the object, and $R$ is its radius.  The distance from the center of the object to the surface really.

3.  **Earth vs. Moon - Setting Up the Variables:** Okay, I'll create the two equations. For Earth:  $g_E = \frac{GM_E}{R_E^2}$. And for the Moon: $g_M = \frac{GM_M}{R_M^2}$.

4.  **Data Time:** I need some quick approximations. The gravitational constant, $G$, is constant and doesn't affect the comparison, so I can ignore it. Let me see… $M_E$ is huge, roughly $6 \times 10^{24}$ kg.  $R_E$ is about $6.4 \times 10^6$ meters. The Moon? $M_M$ is much smaller, around $7 \times 10^{22}$ kg, and $R_M$ is also smaller, maybe $1.7 \times 10^6$ meters. This gives me a basis for comparison

5.  **Comparison - Qualitative and Then Quantitative:** Now for the analysis. Okay, first, *qualitatively*. The Moon has a much *smaller* mass. That's going to *decrease* the gravity.  But, the Moon is also a *smaller* radius.  Since radius is squared in the denominator, a smaller radius would *increase* gravity. These are competing effects. I will need to calculate.

    Let's use the ratio method, dividing the moon’s gravity by the earth’s gravity : $\frac{g_M}{g_E} = \frac{GM_M/R_M^2}{GM_E/R_E^2} = \frac{M_M}{R_M^2} \times \frac{R_E^2}{M_E} = \left(\frac{M_M}{M_E}\right) \times \left(\frac{R_E}{R_M}\right)^2$

    Let's plug in the values: $\frac{M_M}{M_E} \approx \frac{7.35 \times 10^{22}}{5.97 \times 10^{24}} \approx 0.0123$. The Moon's mass is about 1/80th of Earth's. $\frac{R_E}{R_M} \approx \frac{6.37 \times 10^6}{1.74 \times 10^6} \approx 3.66$.  So Earth's radius is almost 4 times the Moon's. And  $\left(\frac{R_E}{R_M}\right)^2 \approx (3.66)^2 \approx 13.4$

    Put them together: $\frac{g_M}{g_E} \approx 0.0123 \times 13.4 \approx 0.165$. This means $g_M \approx 0.165 \times g_E$. And since $g_E$ is approximately 9.8 m/s², $g_M$ is about $1.62 \text{ m/s}^2$.

6.  **Constructing the Steps:**  Now, how do I break this down for them?  Here's the game plan:

    *   **Step 1:**  Define acceleration due to gravity: formula ($g = \frac{GM}{R^2}$) and what each term means.
    *   **Step 2:**  Highlight what affects $g$ – mass and radius.
    *   **Step 3:** Compare Moon and Earth: Moon's mass is *much* less, but the radius is also smaller.
    *   **Step 4:** Discuss the effects of each difference: Smaller mass *decreases* gravity; smaller radius *increases* gravity.
    *   **Step 5:**  Emphasize that mass difference dominates. Quantitative comparison needed:  show that the ratio is around 1/6. Provide approximate values:  Moon's gravity is approximately 1.6 m/s², while Earth's is about 9.8 m/s².
    *   **Step 6:** State the Conclusion: Final Answer.

7.  **The Final Answer** Okay: **Yes**.

8.  **Review & Refine:**  Does this flow? Is it clear?  The language is direct, steps are logical. Yes/No answer is at the end. The math is presented in a reasonable manner. It should be good to go. The competition of factors are presented. Excellent.

Yes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step 1: Understand the Formula for Acceleration Due to Gravity ($g$)**
The acceleration due to gravity ($g$) on the surface of a celestial body is given by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:
$g = \frac{GM}{R^2}$
Where:
*   $G$ is the Universal Gravitational Constant (a constant value everywhere in the universe).
*   $M$ is the mass of the celestial body.
*   $R$ is the radius of the celestial body (specifically, the distance from its center to the point where $g$ is measured, usually its surface).

**Step 2: Identify the Key Factors for Comparison**
To compare $g$ on the Moon ($g_M$) and Earth ($g_E$), we need to compare their respective masses ($M$) and radii ($R$).

**Step 3: Compare the Properties of the Moon and Earth**
Let's look at the approximate values:

*   **Earth:**
    *   Mass ($M_E$) $\approx 5.97 \times 10^{24}$ kg
    *   Radius ($R_E$) $\approx 6.37 \times 10^6$ m
    *   $g_E \approx 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$

*   **Moon:**
    *   Mass ($M_M$) $\approx 7.35 \times 10^{22}$ kg (The Moon's mass is about 1/81st of Earth's mass)
    *   Radius ($R_M$) $\approx 1.74 \times 10^6$ m (The Moon's radius is about 1/3.66th of Earth's radius)

**Step 4: Analyze the Impact of Each Factor on $g$**

*   **Impact of Mass ($M$):** Since $M$ is in the numerator of the formula ($g = GM/R^2$), a *smaller mass* leads to a *smaller $g$*. The Moon's mass is significantly less than Earth's, which would tend to make $g_M$ much smaller than $g_E$.

*   **Impact of Radius ($R$):** Since $R$ is in the denominator and *squared* ($R^2$), a *smaller radius* leads to a *larger $g$*. The Moon's radius is smaller than Earth's, which would tend to make $g_M$ larger than if its radius were the same as Earth's.

**Step 5: Determine the Dominant Factor**
We have two competing effects: the Moon's much smaller mass tends to decrease $g$, while its smaller radius tends to increase $g$. To find out which effect dominates, we can calculate the ratio:

$\frac{g_M}{g_E} = \frac{GM_M/R_M^2}{GM_E/R_E^2} = \frac{M_M}{M_E} \times \left(\frac{R_E}{R_M}\right)^2$

Plugging in the approximate ratios:
*   $\frac{M_M}{M_E} \approx \frac{1}{81}$
*   $\frac{R_E}{R_M} \approx 3.66 \implies \left(\frac{R_E}{R_M}\right)^2 \approx (3.66)^2 \approx 13.4$

So, $\frac{g_M}{g_E} \approx \frac{1}{81} \times 13.4 \approx 0.165$

This means $g_M \approx 0.165 \times g_E$.
Since $g_E \approx 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$, then $g_M \approx 0.165 \times 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2 \approx 1.62 \text{ m/s}^2$.

The Moon's mass is so much smaller than Earth's that this effect *dominates* over the effect of its smaller radius. As a result, the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is significantly less than on Earth (approximately one-sixth).

**Final Answer:**

**Yes**
