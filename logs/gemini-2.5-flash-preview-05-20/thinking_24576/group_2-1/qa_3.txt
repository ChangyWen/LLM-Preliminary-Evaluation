Alright, here's how I'd approach this question, breaking it down step-by-step in my head.

First, I've got to get a handle on the question itself. It's straightforward enough - comparing the death dates of Einstein and Newton. Basically, who shuffled off this mortal coil *later*? Easy peasy.

Then, I need to pinpoint the players: Einstein and Newton. Both giants, of course.

Next, the key: their death dates. Now, Newton's a pre-modern figure; I'm fairly certain he was quite old. Let me pull that date from memory, or, if I need a refresher, I can look it up quickly. Okay, a mental check... yep, March 31, 1727. Got it. Einstein, being a modern physicist, is a bit more clear. Relativity, 20th century... Okay, April 18, 1955.

Time to compare. Newton in 1727, Einstein in 1955.

And, of course, 1955 is significantly later than 1727. Simple.

So, to structure my response logically: I'll state Newton's death year, then Einstein's, and then make the comparison. This will clearly show which death occurred later.

The answer? Based on these dates, Einstein undeniably passed away later. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Let's break down the death dates of both scientists:

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Determine Isaac Newton's death date:** Isaac Newton died on **March 31, 1727**.
2.  **Determine Albert Einstein's death date:** Albert Einstein died on **April 18, 1955**.
3.  **Compare the two dates:**
    *   Newton: 1727
    *   Einstein: 1955
    Since 1955 is a later year than 1727, Albert Einstein died later than Isaac Newton.

**The final answer is:** Yes
