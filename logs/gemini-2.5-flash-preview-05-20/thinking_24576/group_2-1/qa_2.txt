*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this question: "Is Mount Everest taller than K2?" It's pretty straightforward, but let's break it down properly.

First, I need to understand *exactly* what's being asked. The user wants to know which mountain is taller, and they want a clear answer, including the reasoning behind it.

My immediate reaction is to think about peak heights. My mental catalog immediately pulls up that Everest is *the* highest mountain globally. K2, in contrast, is the second highest. Okay, simple comparison then.

Now, to be thorough and lend credibility, let's add some concrete numbers. I'm recalling the latest, official measurement of Mount Everest is about 8,848.86 meters, or roughly 29,031.7 feet, give or take. K2 clocks in around 8,611 meters or around 28,251 feet.

Therefore, I'm going to compare these two heights. To articulate the reasoning step-by-step, I would set out the following:

*   **Step 1:** Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain, is approximately 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) high.
*   **Step 2:** K2, the world's second highest mountain, is approximately 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) high.
*   **Step 3:** Comparing the two, 8,848.86 meters is greater than 8,611 meters (29,031.7 ft > 28,251 ft).
*   **Step 4:** Thus, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

Finally, the answer must be clear. I'll provide a simple "Yes" or "No."

I would check this approach. Is the reasoning clear? Numbers accurate? Does it answer the core question? Is the answer concise? Yep, it all checks out.

Yes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Identify Mount Everest's Height:** Mount Everest is officially recognized as the highest mountain in the world. Its current accepted height is **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)** above sea level.

2.  **Identify K2's Height:** K2 (also known as Mount Godwin Austen) is the second-highest mountain in the world. Its height is **8,611 meters (28,251 feet)** above sea level.

3.  **Compare the Heights:**
    *   Everest: 8,848.86 meters
    *   K2: 8,611 meters

    Comparing these two values, 8,848.86 meters is greater than 8,611 meters.

4.  **Conclusion:** Since Mount Everest's elevation is higher than K2's elevation, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

**Final Answer:** Yes
