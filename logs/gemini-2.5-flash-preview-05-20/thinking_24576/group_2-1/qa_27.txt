*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this. The question is pretty basic, so it's about making the reasoning absolutely clear.

First, I break down the request. It's a comparison – the melting point of ice versus the boiling point of water. Then I make sure I’m crystal clear on the values themselves, which are fundamental concepts. I'll need the melting point of ice, the boiling point of water, and I'm comparing the values to see if one is lower than the other.

Next, I call up those critical reference points. Melting point of ice: that's 0°C, right? At standard pressure, of course. No need to get fancy. Boiling point of water: 100°C, again at standard pressure. Easy peasy. I can use either Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin, but Celsius is the cleanest here.

Now, I do the actual comparison. 0°C is definitely less than 100°C.

To structure the answer, I break it down in a logical way. The first thing I need to do is identify and define the melting point of ice. Then, define the boiling point of water. Then compare the values, and finally, state my conclusion. I'm going to make sure each step is easy to follow.

So, I start drafting. "The melting point of ice, at standard atmospheric pressure, is 0°C." Then, "The boiling point of water, at standard atmospheric pressure, is 100°C." Now, I'll directly compare them: "Comparing these two values, we see that 0°C is less than 100°C." And, finally, the answer: "Yes, the melting point of ice is lower than the boiling point of water."

I'll review to make sure it's got all the elements of the prompt, is clear, and has the final yes/no answer required. Looks good. Done.

Yes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify the Melting Point of Ice:** The melting point of ice (pure water in its solid state) at standard atmospheric pressure is **0 degrees Celsius (°C)**, which is equivalent to 32 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) or 273.15 Kelvin (K).

2.  **Identify the Boiling Point of Water:** The boiling point of water (pure water in its liquid state) at standard atmospheric pressure is **100 degrees Celsius (°C)**, which is equivalent to 212 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) or 373.15 Kelvin (K).

3.  **Compare the Two Temperatures:**
    *   Melting Point of Ice = 0 °C
    *   Boiling Point of Water = 100 °C

    Comparing these two values, 0 °C is clearly a lower temperature than 100 °C.

**Final Answer:**

Yes
