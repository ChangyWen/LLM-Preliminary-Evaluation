*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here’s how I'd approach this question. First, I need to understand *exactly* what’s being asked. "Is the pH of lemon juice lower than that of water? Show your work. Yes or No." Got it. Straightforward.

Right off the bat, I know lemon juice is sour, and that means it's acidic. Water is, well, pretty much neutral. The pH scale…right, 0 to 14. Seven is neutral. Anything below seven is acidic. Therefore, if lemon juice is acidic, its pH *must* be lower than water's. Easy enough. "Yes."

Now, to structure this for a clear explanation, I need to walk the reader through it methodically.

*   **Step 1: Define pH.** I’ll start by explaining that pH is a measure of acidity and alkalinity, and quickly detail the scale, pointing out 7 is neutral, below is acidic, and above is alkaline. Keep it simple; no need to get bogged down in formulas unless it's *required*.

*   **Step 2: Characterize Water.** Next, I'll state that pure water has a pH of 7. Important to specify *pure* water, as tap water can vary a bit.

*   **Step 3: Characterize Lemon Juice.** Now, lemon juice. It's sour, and the source of that sourness is citric acid. That means it's acidic. I should give an approximate pH range for lemon juice, say, 2 to 3, just to be precise.

*   **Step 4: Compare.** This is the crucial step. I need to directly compare the pH values. I’ll state: Lemon juice pH (2-3) versus water pH (7). And then the key: 2-3 is *lower* than 7.

*   **Step 5: Conclude.** Finally, I’ll reiterate the answer: Since lemon juice has a lower pH than water, it is indeed more acidic.

Okay, now I review the entire response. Is it clear? Does it directly address the question? Is the language precise, especially the difference between “pure water” and “water?" Did I remember to highlight the “Yes/No” answer?

During the review, I might revise how I present the information to ensure maximum clarity. For example, initially, I may have thought to simply state that lemon juice is acidic. But it's important to give the reason why (citric acid) and cite a standard pH range. Ultimately, I need to ensure that the comparison step explicitly and clearly states that lemon juice's pH is *lower* than water's. That’s the key. I need to make sure it's as rigorous as possible. Alright, let's write it.

Yes.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Understanding the pH Scale:** The pH scale measures the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. It ranges from 0 to 14:
    *   **pH 7:** Neutral (like pure water).
    *   **pH less than 7:** Acidic (the lower the number, the more acidic).
    *   **pH greater than 7:** Basic/Alkaline (the higher the number, the more basic).

2.  **pH of Water:** Pure water (H₂O) is considered neutral. Its pH is approximately **7**. Tap water can vary slightly due to dissolved minerals, but it generally remains close to 7.

3.  **pH of Lemon Juice:** Lemon juice is well-known for its sour taste, which is characteristic of acids. It contains a significant amount of citric acid. Due to its high acid content, lemon juice is highly acidic. Its typical pH range is between **2 and 3**.

4.  **Comparison:**
    *   pH of Lemon Juice: ~2-3
    *   pH of Water: ~7

    Since 2-3 is a significantly lower number than 7, the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water. A lower pH indicates a higher acidity.

**Final Answer:** Yes
