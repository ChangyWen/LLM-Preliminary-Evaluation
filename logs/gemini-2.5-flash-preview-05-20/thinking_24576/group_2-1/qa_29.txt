*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this. The question is a straightforward one about comparing the wavelengths of red and blue light.  My initial thought is to break this down into logical steps, making it easy to explain the underlying physics.

1.  **The Core Task:** The heart of the question is a direct comparison – does red light have a longer wavelength than blue light?  The prompt wants a step-by-step explanation, so clarity and organization are crucial.  I need to ensure the reasoning is sound and leads directly to a "Yes/No" answer.

2.  **Laying the Foundation: Electromagnetic Spectrum Basics:**  My mind immediately jumps to the fundamentals.  I know that light is electromagnetic radiation, a spectrum encompassing everything from radio waves to gamma rays. The visible spectrum is just a tiny slice. Different wavelengths within this visible light range *are* the different colors we perceive.

3.  **Color Ordering: The ROYGBIV Reminder:**  The next piece is the classic ROYGBIV mnemonic.  It serves as a mental roadmap of the visible spectrum's colors. I know that the usual presentation of ROYGBIV is organized by wavelength, with red at the long-wavelength end.

4.  **The Relationship: Wavelength, Frequency, and Energy:**  This is where it becomes more explicit. I need to connect wavelength to other properties.  The speed of light being constant (c), tells me that wavelength (λ) and frequency (ν) are inversely proportional (c = λν). I also know that energy (E) is directly proportional to frequency (E = hν). So, longer wavelength means lower frequency, and therefore lower energy.

5.  **Back to Red and Blue:** Now I directly apply these ideas to the core question. Red is at one end of ROYGBIV, the long-wavelength end.  Blue is closer to the shorter-wavelength end. Therefore, red light has a longer wavelength.

6.  **(Optional, but Good Practice: Wavelength Ranges):** To further refine my explanation, I could add some quantitative precision.  I can roughly recall the wavelength ranges. Red is approximately 620-750 nanometers, while blue is around 450-495 nm. The quantitative values strongly confirm my previous reasoning.

7.  **Structuring the Explanation:**  I would then frame the answer in a step-by-step fashion to convey this reasoning to others. This will require a breakdown of my thought process into the essential components:

    *   **Step 1:** Define visible light as part of the EM spectrum, and its relationship to color.
    *   **Step 2:** Mention the color order and how it relates to wavelength.
    *   **Step 3:** Connect a color's position in the spectrum to its wavelength.
    *   **Step 4:** Directly compare the positions of red and blue to conclude which has a longer wavelength.

8.  **The Final Answer:**  Based on this reasoning, the answer is unequivocally "Yes". Red light does indeed have a longer wavelength.

9.  **Review and Perfect:**  Before submitting, I would need to quickly assess if the explanation is clear, concise, and logical. Does it directly address the question?  Are there any gaps or potential points of confusion?  The answer is straightforward and complete. No issues here.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

**Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understanding Visible Light:** Visible light is a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Different colors of light correspond to different wavelengths (and frequencies/energies).
2.  **The Visible Spectrum Order:** The colors of the visible light spectrum are commonly remembered by the acronym ROYGBIV:
    *   **R**ed
    *   **O**range
    *   **Y**ellow
    *   **G**reen
    *   **B**lue
    *   **I**ndigo
    *   **V**iolet
3.  **Wavelength Trend in the Spectrum:** This order (ROYGBIV) is arranged from the longest wavelength to the shortest wavelength.
    *   Red light has the longest wavelengths in the visible spectrum.
    *   Violet light has the shortest wavelengths in the visible spectrum.
4.  **Comparing Red and Blue Light:**
    *   Red light is at the "long wavelength" end of the spectrum.
    *   Blue light is closer to the "short wavelength" end (between green and indigo/violet).
    *   Therefore, red light's wavelength is longer than blue light's wavelength. (Typical approximate ranges: Red light ~620-750 nanometers; Blue light ~450-495 nanometers).

**Final Answer:**

Yes
