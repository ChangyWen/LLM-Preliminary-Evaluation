*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's my thought process on this. The core question is a simple area comparison between Russia and Australia – a straightforward "yes" or "no" question.  But the real test is laying out the *why*.

First, I'd tap into my existing knowledge base.  Russia?  Gigantic.  World's largest country.  Spans a vast chunk of Europe and Asia. Australia? Also huge, an entire continent, the "island continent" as they say.  But, off the top of my head, I don't think it's *the* largest. So, my initial hypothesis is Russia is bigger.

Now, I absolutely *cannot* rely on just that feeling, though. This is where I need precise data. I need *exact* figures to back this up, that step-by-step reasoning. The next thing I do is recall the area of each.

So, now, let's do a quick run through of retrieving the data - Russia's area: ~17 million square kilometers, and Australia's area: around ~7.7 million square kilometers. Comparing those numbers, it's immediately obvious: Russia is substantially bigger.

To structure my response, I'd outline the actual area figures I've arrived at, and then do an explicit comparison.  I'll make it crystal clear, stating Russia's size and Australia's size, then directly saying that Russia's area is larger. That provides the step-by-step justification the prompt is looking for.

Therefore, the answer is yes: Russia is indeed larger than Australia.

To determine if Russia is larger in area than Australia, we need to compare their respective total land areas.

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the total area of Russia:**
    *   Russia is the largest country in the world by area.
    *   Its total area is approximately **17,098,246 square kilometers (km²)** or about 6,601,670 square miles.

2.  **Identify the total area of Australia:**
    *   Australia is the world's sixth-largest country by total area.
    *   Its total area is approximately **7,692,024 square kilometers (km²)** or about 2,969,907 square miles.

3.  **Compare the two areas:**
    *   Russia's area: 17,098,246 km²
    *   Australia's area: 7,692,024 km²

    Comparing these figures, 17,098,246 km² is clearly much larger than 7,692,024 km².

**Final Answer:**

Yes.
