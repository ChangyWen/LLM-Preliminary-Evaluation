*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'm tackling this. The question is, essentially, "Is the boiling point higher than the freezing point?" and I need to break down my thinking.

First, the request itself needs breaking down. I see I have to answer "Yes" or "No" *and* provide a detailed, step-by-step rationale. Right.

Then, I go to the science. Let's bring up the key concepts: Boiling point. I instantly know, for pure water under standard atmospheric pressure, that's 100 degrees Celsius. And just to be thorough, or even to give a more fulsome answer, I'll also mention 212 degrees Fahrenheit. Next up: Freezing point. Again, under standard conditions for pure water, that’s 0 degrees Celsius (or 32 degrees Fahrenheit). 

Crucially, I remember to specify "pure water" and "standard atmospheric pressure." These are the baseline conditions, of course, but precision matters. Impurities change things, as does altitude. However, for a straightforward comparison, we assume the standards.

Now, to the core of the problem: comparing the values. So, 100 degrees Celsius versus 0 degrees Celsius, and 212 degrees Fahrenheit versus 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Clearly, 100 is greater than 0, and 212 is greater than 32.

Now the step-by-step structure. First: define boiling point; then state the standard value. Second: define freezing point; then state its standard value. Third: compare the temperatures numerically. Finally, conclude based on the comparison.

And finally, the answer itself. I initially thought, "100 is greater than 0, so yes." But, *no*, the request wants a full explanation. So I must elaborate on the steps required. That is essential.

I might have initially skipped over including Fahrenheit. However, to show full comprehension and to show that I have full confidence in the answer, adding Fahrenheit is worthwhile.

Yes.

**Step-by-step reasoning process:**

1.  **Identify the boiling point of water:** The boiling point of pure water at standard atmospheric pressure is 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit). This is the temperature at which water transitions from a liquid to a gas (steam).
2.  **Identify the freezing point of water:** The freezing point of pure water at standard atmospheric pressure is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). This is the temperature at which water transitions from a liquid to a solid (ice).
3.  **Compare the two temperatures:**
    *   Boiling Point: 100°C
    *   Freezing Point: 0°C
    Since 100°C is a higher temperature than 0°C, the boiling point is higher than the freezing point.

**Final Answer:** Yes
