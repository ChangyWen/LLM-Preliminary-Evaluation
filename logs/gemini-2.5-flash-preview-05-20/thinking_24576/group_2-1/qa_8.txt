*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this question about the Sahara and Gobi temperatures. First, what do I know? The Sahara's in Africa; it's *hot*. The Gobi's in Asia – Mongolia and China – and I know it gets incredibly cold in the winter. But the question isn't *which is cold*; it's which is *hotter*. Okay, so first I need to understand what makes a place hot, then compare the two.

My initial thought is that the Sahara, with its latitude closer to the equator, is going to be hotter overall. Thinking about it more deeply though, the word "desert" just means a dry area. It *doesn't* necessarily mean hot. So, to answer the question properly, I need a good, logical framework.

Right, let's break this down. First, **location and latitude** are crucial. The Sahara, spread across North Africa, is closer to the equator. This means it receives more direct sunlight year-round, hence more solar radiation, and therefore, it *should* be warmer. The Gobi, in Mongolia and China, is at a much higher latitude. That's already a significant clue.

Next, I think about **climate classifications**. The Sahara is a classic *hot desert*. Think of those images: sand dunes, intense sun. The Gobi, though, is considered a *cold or temperate desert*. Rain shadow effect, high latitude. That already points me to the answer.

Now, I get into the **temperature extremes and averages**. The Sahara is renowned for its scorching summer highs – regularly over 40°C (104°F) and it stays hot for a long time. Winters are quite mild, although still quite dry. The Gobi, on the other hand, has those hot summers, but then those *brutal* winters. Temperatures well below freezing, snow, ice. So, while it might have warm summers, the frigid winters will significantly pull down its *average annual temperature*. That's the key! I can use the terms like "temperature range," "latitude," and "continental climate" to make this more precise.

I'm mentally checking and remembering that the Sahara has some of the highest recorded temperatures globally. Whereas the Gobi has those extreme temperature swings between seasons.

Therefore, if we're asking "hotter" in the sense of overall higher average annual temperature and consistently extreme heat, the Sahara is definitely hotter. It gets much more solar energy, and the extremes aren't as extreme on the cold side. So, I can conclude that the Sahara is the hotter of the two deserts. I can refine the final answer for clarity.

Yes, the Sahara Desert is generally hotter than the Gobi Desert.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1.  **Location and Latitude:**
    *   **Sahara Desert:** Located in North Africa, it spans a wide range of latitudes, primarily within the subtropical high-pressure belt (roughly 15°N to 30°N). This position means it receives very direct and intense solar radiation throughout most of the year.
    *   **Gobi Desert:** Located in East Asia, primarily in Mongolia and China, it is situated at much higher latitudes (roughly 40°N to 50°N). Due to its higher latitude, it receives less direct solar radiation on average compared to the Sahara.

2.  **Climate Classification:**
    *   **Sahara Desert:** Is classified as a **hot desert** (or subtropical desert). Its climate is characterized by extremely high temperatures, especially in summer, and very mild winters.
    *   **Gobi Desert:** Is classified as a **cold desert** (or temperate desert). While its summers can be warm to hot, its winters are extremely cold, often dropping well below freezing with significant snowfall.

3.  **Temperature Extremes and Averages:**
    *   **Sahara Desert:**
        *   **Summers:** Consistently experiences some of the highest temperatures on Earth, often exceeding 40°C (104°F) and frequently reaching 50°C (122°F) or more. Nighttime temperatures remain relatively high.
        *   **Winters:** Generally mild, with average daily temperatures rarely dropping below 10°C (50°F), though nights can be cool.
        *   **Average Annual Temperature:** High, due to consistently warm conditions.
    *   **Gobi Desert:**
        *   **Summers:** Can be hot, with temperatures sometimes reaching 35-40°C (95-104°F), but these peaks are less frequent and sustained than in the Sahara.
        *   **Winters:** Extremely cold, with average January temperatures often around -20°C (-4°F) and frequently dropping to -40°C (-40°F). Snow and ice are common.
        *   **Average Annual Temperature:** Significantly lower than the Sahara's due to the brutally cold and long winters.

4.  **Continental Climate:** Both deserts experience a continental climate (far from moderating oceans), leading to large diurnal (daily) and seasonal temperature ranges. However, the Gobi's higher latitude and position deep within the Asian landmass amplify the winter cold to a much greater extent than in the Sahara.

**Final Answer:** Yes
