*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Pragser Wildsee located west of Lake Vico?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I should recall or look up the locations of these lakes. Pragser Wildsee is in Italy, specifically in the Dolomites, in the South Tyrol region. Lake Vico is also in Italy, in the Lazio region, near Rome.

Let me confirm that:

- Pragser Wildsee, also known as Lago di Braies, is in the province of South Tyrol, northern Italy.

- Lake Vico, or Lago di Vico, is in the province of Viterbo, in central Italy, near the town of Caprarola.

Now, to determine if Pragser Wildsee is west of Lake Vico, I need to compare their geographical positions.

- South Tyrol is in the northern part of Italy, close to the Austrian border.

- Lazio is in central Italy, south of Tuscany and east of the Tyrrhenian Sea.

More precisely:

- Pragser Wildsee is approximately at 46.7° N latitude and 12.1° E longitude.

- Lake Vico is around 42.4° N latitude and 12.1° E longitude. Wait, is that right? Let me think.

Actually, both might have similar longitudes. South Tyrol is in the eastern Alps, and Lake Vico is inland in central Italy.

Let me recall approximate coordinates:

- Pragser Wildsee: About 46.69° N, 12.05° E.

- Lake Vico: About 42.42° N, 12.07° E.

If both have similar longitudes around 12° E, then Pragser Wildsee is north of Lake Vico, not west.

Longitude determines east-west position, and latitude determines north-south.

If both are at approximately 12° E, then they are on the same meridian, so neither is directly west or east of the other; one is directly north.

Pragser Wildsee is at 12.05° E, and Lake Vico is at about 12.07° E. That's almost the same.

Upon double-checking my mental notes:

- South Tyrol is in the northeast of Italy.

- Lake Vico is in central Italy, but let's confirm the exact positions.

Italy's boot shape: North is Milan, Venice; South Tyrol is further east, near the Austrian border.

South Tyrol is east of Lake Garda and west of the Slovenian border.

Perhaps I need to be more accurate.

Standard geography:

- Western Italy: Liguria, Piedmont.

- Central: Tuscany, Umbria, Lazio.

- Eastern: Veneto, Friuli.

South Tyrol is in the Trentino-Alto Adige region, which is northern and somewhat central-north, but specifically, it's east of Switzerland and west of Austria? No.

Alto Adige (South Tyrol) is bordered by Switzerland to the west and Austria to the north.

Switzerland is west of South Tyrol.

Let's clarify:

- Milan is west, Venice is east.

- South Tyrol is north, between Switzerland (west) and Austria (north/east).

The longitude of Bolzano (in South Tyrol) is about 11.35° E.

I think I have it wrong.

Let me correct myself:

Upon thinking, approximate longitudes:

- Rome (near Lake Vico) is at 12.48° E.

- Lake Vico is west of Rome, so perhaps around 12.1° E.

No: Viterbo is northwest of Rome, so similar longitude.

Rome is 12.48° E, Viterbo is about 12.07° E, which is slightly west of Rome.

Pragser Wildsee: Braies is in South Tyrol, near the Austrian border. Bolzano is at 11.35° E, and Braies is further east, around 12.0° E or so.

Actually, upon second thought:

- Innsbruck, Austria, is at 11.4° E.

- Bolzano is at 11.35° E.

- Braies (Pragser Wildsee) is east of Bolzano, so perhaps 11.9° E or 12.0° E.

I need to be precise. From memory, Pragser Wildsee is at approximately 12.04° E longitude and 46.69° N latitude.

Lake Vico is at 42.42° N and 12.08° E longitude.

So, both have longitudes very close: 12.04° E and 12.08° E.

12.04° E is slightly west of 12.08° E.

Longitude increases as you go east. So, 12.04° E is west of 12.08° E.

Yes! So, Pragser Wildsee at 12.04° E is west of Lake Vico at 12.08° E.

Is that accurate? Let me confirm the exact values.

Upon double-checking my knowledge:

- Actual coordinates: Pragser Wildsee: 46.6929° N, 12.0433° E

- Lake Vico: 42.4247° N, 12.0808° E

Yes, so longitude of Pragser Wildsee: 12.0433° E

Longitude of Lake Vico: 12.0808° E

Since 12.0433° E is less than 12.0808° E, Pragser Wildsee is west of Lake Vico.

Therefore, yes, it is located west of Lake Vico.

Is that correct? Longitude increases eastward, so a smaller longitude number means further west.

Yes, exactly. So, 12.0433° E is west of 12.0808° E.

For example, Greenwich is 0°, and as you go east, it increases up to 180°.

So, final answer should be Yes.

They are far apart in latitude, but the question is only about west, which is east-west direction.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify locations: Pragser Wildsee in South Tyrol, Italy; Lake Vico in Lazio, Italy.

2. Get approximate longitudes: Pragser Wildsee ~12.04° E; Lake Vico ~12.08° E.

3. Compare longitudes: Since 12.04° E < 12.08° E, Pragser Wildsee is west of Lake Vico.

4. Therefore, the answer is Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations of the lakes:**
   - Pragser Wildsee (also known as Lago di Braies) is located in the South Tyrol region of northern Italy, in the Dolomites.
   - Lake Vico (Lago di Vico) is located in the Lazio region of central Italy, near the town of Caprarola.

2. **Determine the approximate coordinates:**
   - Pragser Wildsee: Approximately 46.69° N latitude and 12.04° E longitude.
   - Lake Vico: Approximately 42.42° N latitude and 12.08° E longitude.

3. **Compare the longitudes to assess east-west position:**
   - Longitude measures east-west position on the globe, with higher values indicating further east.
   - Pragser Wildsee is at 12.04° E.
   - Lake Vico is at 12.08° E.
   - Since 12.04° E is less than 12.08° E, Pragser Wildsee is west of Lake Vico.

4. **Consider any caveats:**
   - The lakes are far apart in latitude (north-south), with Pragser Wildsee being much further north. However, the question specifically asks about the east-west relationship, so we focus on longitude.
   - Based on the coordinates, the east-west positioning holds true.

### Final Answer:
Yes
