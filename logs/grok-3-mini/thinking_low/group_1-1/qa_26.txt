*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is 98580, WA located west of 97233, OR?" I need to determine if the location with ZIP code 98580 in Washington state is west of the location with ZIP code 97233 in Oregon state.

ZIP codes are used in the US, and they correspond to specific geographic areas. So, 98580 is in WA (Washington), and 97233 is in OR (Oregon).

To compare their positions, I need to know their approximate locations on a map, specifically their longitude, because "west" refers to longitude lines.

- Washington state is on the West Coast of the US.

- Oregon is also on the West Coast, directly south of Washington.

More precisely:

- Most of Washington is west of Oregon, but that doesn't make sense because they are adjacent states.

Washington is north of Oregon, so their east-west positions vary.

I need to look at the specific ZIP codes.

Let me recall or estimate:

- 97233 is in Oregon. I know that 972 is the prefix for Portland, Oregon. So, 97233 is likely in the Portland area.

- 98580 is in Washington. Washington ZIP codes starting with 98 are in the western part, like Seattle area. 985 is for Olympia or that region, which is in western Washington.

To be precise, I should think about longitudes.

From my knowledge:

- Portland, OR (which includes 97233) is around 122.6° W longitude.

- Olympia, WA (which is where 98580 is, I believe) is also around 122.9° W longitude.

That might be close. Let me think carefully.

Actually, both are on the west coast, so their longitudes are similar.

Portland is in northwestern Oregon, and Olympia is in western Washington, just north of the border.

The state border between Washington and Oregon is mostly along the Columbia River, which runs east-west.

So, Olympia, WA is north of Portland, OR, but is it west or east?

Olympia is slightly west of Portland.

Let me visualize a map:

- Portland is at about 45.52° N, 122.68° W.

- Olympia is at about 47.04° N, 122.90° W.

Comparing longitudes:

- Portland: 122.68° W

- Olympia: 122.90° W

122.90° W is further west than 122.68° W because higher numbers mean further west in the Western Hemisphere.

Longitude increases westward from the Prime Meridian, so 122.90° W is west of 122.68° W.

Longitude is measured from 0° at Greenwich, east or west.

So, 122.68° W is at 122.68 degrees west, and 122.90° W is at 122.90 degrees west, which is further west.

Yes, so 122.90° W is west of 122.68° W.

Therefore, Olympia (98580, WA) is west of Portland (97233, OR).

Is 98580 exactly Olympia? Let me confirm.

Upon quick mental check: ZIP code 98580 is for Rainier, Washington, which is near Olympia, in Thurston County, western Washington.

And 97233 is for Gresham, Oregon, which is a suburb of Portland, eastern Portland area.

Gresham is east of downtown Portland.

Downtown Portland is around 122.68° W, and Gresham is further east.

Portland's ZIP codes: 97233 is indeed Gresham, which is east of downtown Portland.

So, downtown Portland: ~122.68° W

Gresham (97233): approximately 122.43° W (I think it's east, so smaller longitude number).

East means smaller longitude in the west.

Longitude: east of a point has a smaller degree west.

For example, if Portland is 122.68° W, then east of it would be, say, 122.50° W or something.

Actually, Gresham is at about 122.43° W, which is east of Portland's 122.68° W because 122.43° W is less west than 122.68° W.

To clarify:

- A location at 122.00° W is east of 122.68° W.

Yes, so Gresham, OR (97233) is at approximately 122.43° W.

Olympia, WA (near 98580) is at 122.90° W.

So, comparing:

- 97233, OR: ~122.43° W (Gresham)

- 98580, WA: ~122.90° W (Rainier, WA, which is west of Olympia? Wait no.

Rainier, WA is in Thurston County, and its longitude is around 122.68° W or similar.

I need to be accurate.

Upon second thought, I might have the wrong information.

Let me think again. Olympia is at 122.90° W? No:

Actually, looking it up in my mind: Seattle is at 122.33° W, Portland at 122.68° W.

Olympia is south of Seattle, so let's say Olympia is at about 122.89° W for the city center, but for ZIP 98580, which is Rainier, WA.

Rainier, WA is east of Olympia.

This is getting confusing. I need a better way.

Perhaps I should assume based on general knowledge.

To simplify, I can use the fact that Washington is north, but for east-west, I need longitudes.

From standard knowledge:

- Portland, OR area: longitudes around 122-123° W.

Specifically, 97233 (Gresham): approximately 122.45° W.

- 98580 (Rainier, WA): Rainier is in Washington, and upon checking my knowledge, it's at about 122.69° W.

Let's clarify with approximate values:

After a quick mental search:

- Gresham, OR (97233): 45.50° N, 122.43° W

- Rainier, WA (98580): 46.88° N, 122.69° W

So, 122.69° W vs 122.43° W.

122.69° W is further west than 122.43° W, because 122.69 > 122.43, so it's more degrees west.

Yes, so 98580 at 122.69° W is west of 97233 at 122.43° W.

Therefore, yes, 98580, WA is located west of 97233, OR.

So, the answer should be Yes.

Is that accurate? Let me double-check the longitudes.

Upon second thought, I think I have it right. For example, the Cascade Mountains run north-south, and western Washington and Oregon are west of the mountains, but specific cities:

Portland is on the west side, but Gresham is still on the west side, though east of downtown Portland.

Compared to Rainier, WA, which is further west.

Yes, I believe it's correct.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the locations: 98580 is Rainier, WA; 97233 is Gresham, OR.

2. Find their approximate longitudes: Rainier, WA ≈ 122.69° W; Gresham, OR ≈ 122.43° W.

3. Compare longitudes: Since 122.69° W > 122.43° W (in terms of degrees west), Rainier is further west.

4. Therefore, 98580, WA is west of 97233, OR.

Final answer: Yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if the location with ZIP code 98580 in Washington (WA) is west of the location with ZIP code 97233 in Oregon (OR), I will follow a step-by-step reasoning process based on geographic knowledge of these ZIP codes and their approximate longitudes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations based on ZIP codes:**
   - ZIP code 98580 corresponds to Rainier, Washington, which is in Thurston County, in the western part of Washington state.
   - ZIP code 97233 corresponds to Gresham, Oregon, which is a suburb of Portland, in Multnomah County, in northwestern Oregon.

2. **Understand the concept of "west":**
   - In geography, "west" is determined by longitude. Longitude lines run from north to south, and locations with higher longitude values in the Western Hemisphere (e.g., 122° W) are further west than those with lower values (e.g., 121° W). So, to compare, we need the approximate longitudes of these locations.

3. **Determine the approximate longitudes:**
   - Based on standard geographic data:
     - Rainier, WA (ZIP 98580) is approximately at 122.69° W longitude.
     - Gresham, OR (ZIP 97233) is approximately at 122.43° W longitude.

4. **Compare the longitudes:**
   - 122.69° W (Rainier, WA) is greater than 122.43° W (Gresham, OR) in terms of degrees west.
   - This means 122.69° W is further west than 122.43° W.

5. **Draw the conclusion:**
   - Since the longitude of 98580 (Rainier, WA) is further west than that of 97233 (Gresham, OR), the location of 98580 is west of 97233.

### Final Answer:
Yes
