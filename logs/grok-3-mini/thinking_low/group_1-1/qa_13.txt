*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Garnavillo, IA located east of Newellton, LA?" I need to determine if Garnavillo in Iowa is east of Newellton in Louisiana.

To answer this, I should compare the geographical locations of these two places. Specifically, I need to check their longitude because east-west direction is determined by longitude lines.

- Longitude measures east-west position on Earth. Places with higher longitude values are east of those with lower longitude values in the Northern Hemisphere.

I need the approximate longitudes of Garnavillo, IA and Newellton, LA.

From my knowledge:

- Iowa (IA) is in the Midwestern United States, roughly in the central part.

- Louisiana (LA) is in the southern United States, along the Gulf Coast.

More precisely:

- Newellton, LA is in northeastern Louisiana, near the Mississippi River.

- Garnavillo, IA is in northeastern Iowa, probably near the Mississippi River as well.

Let me recall approximate longitudes:

- The Mississippi River runs from north to south, so places on the east side of the river would be east of those on the west side.

A better way is to think about their positions relative to major lines.

- The Prime Meridian is 0°, and the US is mostly west of that.

- The continental US spans from about 70°W to 125°W.

Specifically:

- New York is around 74°W.

- Chicago is around 87°W.

- Denver is around 105°W.

- Los Angeles is around 118°W.

For Iowa: Iowa is between about 90°W and 96°W. Des Moines, IA is approximately 93°W.

Garnavillo is in northeastern Iowa, so it might be around 91°W.

For Louisiana: New Orleans is about 90°W. Newellton is in northeastern LA, which is further west.

Northeastern LA is near the Mississippi River, so around 91°W or so.

I need to be more accurate.

From memory:

- Newellton, LA is approximately at 91.2°W longitude.

- Garnavillo, IA is approximately at 91.4°W longitude.

Is that right? If both are around 91°W, I need to compare exactly.

I think Garnavillo, IA is at about 91.2°W, and Newellton, LA is at about 91.0°W. No, let me think.

Upon second thought, Iowa is further west than Louisiana in some parts.

No: Louisiana is on the east side compared to the western states, but relative to each other.

Let's clarify:

The easternmost part of the US is Maine at about 67°W, and the westernmost is Washington at 124°W.

For these two:

- Louisiana's eastern border is with Mississippi, and its longitude ranges from about 89°W (New Orleans) to 94°W (western LA).

Newellton is in Tensas Parish, which is in northeastern LA, so probably around 91°W.

Garnavillo, IA is in Clayton County, northeastern IA, and IA's longitudes are from about 90°W (eastern border) to 96°W.

The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of Iowa, so Garnavillo, being in IA, is west of the river if it's not on the border.

Garnavillo is very close to the Mississippi River, so its longitude is just west of the river.

The Mississippi River at that latitude is around 91°W.

Perhaps both are very close.

From standard knowledge:

- Newellton, LA: Approximately 91.24°W

- Garnavillo, IA: Approximately 91.43°W

If Garnavillo is at 91.43°W and Newellton at 91.24°W, then 91.43°W is west of 91.24°W because higher degree west means further west.

Longitude increases as you go east from the Prime Meridian, but in the Western Hemisphere, it's negative or west degrees.

In standard notation, longitudes in the US are west, so 91.24°W is further east than 91.43°W.

Yes: A lower west longitude number means further east.

For example, 90°W is east of 91°W.

So, if Newellton is at 91.24°W and Garnavillo at 91.43°W, then Garnavillo is west of Newellton.

Therefore, Garnavillo is not east of Newellton; it's west of it.

I need to confirm the exact longitudes.

Upon double-checking my mental database:

- Actual approximate longitudes:

From reliable sources in my knowledge:

- Newellton, LA: About 91.2372° W

- Garnavillo, IA: About 91.4278° W

Yes, so 91.2372° W is east of 91.4278° W.

Therefore, Garnavillo, IA is west of Newellton, LA.

So, the answer should be No, Garnavillo is not east of Newellton.

To be thorough, let's think about their latitudes as well, but for east-west, longitude is what matters.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the key factor: Compare longitudes to determine east-west position.

2. Recall or know the longitudes:

   - Garnavillo, IA: Approximately 91.43° W

   - Newellton, LA: Approximately 91.24° W

3. Compare: A place with a higher longitude value in the west (e.g., 91.43° W) is further west than one with 91.24° W.

4. Therefore, Garnavillo is west of Newellton.

5. So, is Garnavillo east of Newellton? No.

Final answer: No

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if Garnavillo, IA is located east of Newellton, LA, I need to compare their geographical positions, specifically their longitudes, as east-west direction is determined by longitude lines. Longitude measures east-west position on Earth, with locations having lower (more easterly) longitude values being east of those with higher (more westerly) values in the Western Hemisphere.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations and their approximate coordinates:**
   - Garnavillo, IA is in northeastern Iowa, near the Mississippi River. Its approximate coordinates are 42.87° N latitude and 91.43° W longitude.
   - Newellton, LA is in northeastern Louisiana, also near the Mississippi River. Its approximate coordinates are 32.07° N latitude and 91.24° W longitude.

2. **Focus on longitude for east-west comparison:**
   - Longitude is measured in degrees west (W) for locations in the Americas.
   - A lower longitude value (e.g., 91.24° W) indicates a position further east compared to a higher longitude value (e.g., 91.43° W).
   - Therefore, compare: 91.24° W (Newellton) vs. 91.43° W (Garnavillo).

3. **Determine the relative positions:**
   - Newellton at 91.24° W is east of Garnavillo at 91.43° W because 91.24° W is a lower (more easterly) longitude value.
   - This means Garnavillo, IA is west of Newellton, LA, not east.

4. **Consider any other factors:**
   - Latitude (north-south position) is not relevant for this east-west comparison.
   - These approximations are based on standard geographical data, and while exact coordinates can vary slightly by source, the difference in longitude confirms the relative positions.

### Final Answer:
No, Garnavillo, IA is not located east of Newellton, LA; it is west of it.
