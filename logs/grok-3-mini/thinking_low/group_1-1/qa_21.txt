*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Sangre de Cristo Range, CO located east of Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I should understand what these names refer to. Both seem to be geographical features in Colorado, related to the Sangre de Cristo range, which is a mountain range in the Rocky Mountains.

From my knowledge:

- The Sangre de Cristo Mountains are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains, located in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico.

- Specifically, in Colorado, the Sangre de Cristo Range is part of the same mountain system.

Is there a distinction between "Sangre de Cristo Range" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains"? They might be used interchangeably, or one could be a subset of the other.

Upon thinking, "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" is the common name for the entire range, and "Sangre de Cristo Range" might refer to the same thing. But the question treats them as two separate entities: "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO."

This is confusing. Perhaps it's a typo or a misnomer. In reality, they are likely the same feature.

Let me clarify:

- The Sangre de Cristo Mountains extend from southern Colorado into New Mexico.

- In Colorado, it's often just called the Sangre de Cristo Range.

If they are the same, then one can't be east of the other because they are the same location.

But the question implies they are distinct.

Perhaps "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" refers to a specific part or a different naming.

Maybe it's a trick question. Let me think about the geography.

The Sangre de Cristo Mountains run north-south in Colorado, along the eastern edge of the San Luis Valley.

For example, the range is west of the Great Plains and east of the San Luis Valley.

To determine if one is east of the other, I need to know their exact positions.

Upon second thought, both names likely refer to the same mountain range. So, it's not possible for one to be east of the other.

But let's assume they are the same. Then the answer should be No, because a place isn't east of itself.

Perhaps the question means different sections. For instance, is there a Sangre de Cristo Range and a separate Sangre de Cristo Mountains?

After a quick mental search, I recall that "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" is the standard name, and "Range" might be synonymous.

In some contexts, "Range" and "Mountains" are used interchangeably.

Perhaps the question has a error, and it's asking about two different things.

Another idea: Maybe "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" is in Colorado, and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" is also in Colorado, but perhaps one is a peak or a subrange.

This is getting complicated. I need to reason based on general knowledge.

Let me try to visualize a map:

- The Sangre de Cristo Mountains are in south-central Colorado, running from near Salida in the north to the New Mexico border in the south.

- They are east of the San Luis Valley and west of the Wet Mountains or other features.

But both are the same.

Perhaps the question is malformed. In standard geography, they are the same.

If I have to answer, I should say No, because they are the same location.

The question specifies "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO", both in CO, so likely the same.

Maybe "Range" refers to the entire range, and "Mountains" to a specific part, but that's unlikely.

Upon further reflection, I believe they are identical, so one is not east of the other.

Therefore, the answer is No.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the locations: Sangre de Cristo Range and Sangre de Cristo Mountains are both names for the same mountain range in Colorado.

2. If they are the same, then Sangre de Cristo Range is not located east of Sangre de Cristo Mountains; they are in the same place.

3. Thus, the statement is false.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations**: 
   - "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" refers to a mountain range in Colorado, specifically part of the Rocky Mountains in the southern part of the state.
   - "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" also refers to the same geographical feature, which is a subrange of the Rocky Mountains running through southern Colorado and into northern New Mexico.

2. **Compare the names**:
   - The terms "Sangre de Cristo Range" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" are often used interchangeably in geographical contexts. They both describe the same mountain system, which extends north-south along the eastern edge of the San Luis Valley in Colorado.
   - There is no evidence of these being distinct, separate locations within Colorado. They are essentially the same feature, just with slight variations in naming conventions.

3. **Evaluate the spatial relationship**:
   - Since both refer to the same mountain range, they occupy the same geographical area. A location cannot be east (or west, north, or south) of itself.
   - For context, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains/Range is located east of the San Luis Valley and west of the Great Plains, but this does not create a distinction between the two names provided in the query.

4. **Consider potential errors**:
   - If the query intended to ask about two different subranges or features, it might be a misunderstanding, as no such separate entities exist under these exact names in Colorado. Based on standard geographical knowledge, they are not distinct.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Because "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" are the same location, it is not possible for one to be located east of the other.

### Final Answer:
No
