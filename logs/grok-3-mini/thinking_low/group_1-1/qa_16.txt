*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is The Ort Institute, IL located west of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI?" I need to determine if one location is west of the other.

Key elements:
- The Ort Institute, IL: This is likely in Illinois (IL).
- University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI: This is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin (WI).

I need to compare their geographical positions. Specifically, is The Ort Institute west of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan?

Step 1: Identify the locations.
- University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Sheboygan is on the eastern side of Wisconsin, near Lake Michigan.
- The Ort Institute, IL: I'm not immediately familiar with this. It might be a typo or a less common name. Could it be "The Art Institute" or something else? Upon thinking, I recall there's the Art Institute of Chicago in Illinois, but it's specified as "Ort Institute." Maybe it's a placeholder or error. For this exercise, I'll assume it's in Illinois, as indicated by "IL."

The user said "The Ort Institute, IL," so I'll treat it as being in Illinois. But Illinois is a state, so I need a more specific location. Perhaps it's in a city like Chicago, which is common.

Step 2: General geography.
- Wisconsin is to the north and west of Illinois, but let's be precise.
- Sheboygan, WI, is in eastern Wisconsin, on the shore of Lake Michigan.
- Illinois is directly south of Wisconsin. Major cities in Illinois like Chicago are southeast of Wisconsin.

To determine if a point in Illinois is west of Sheboygan:
- Sheboygan is at approximately 43.75° N, 87.71° W (from memory, roughly).
- Chicago, IL, is at about 41.88° N, 87.62° W. So, Chicago is south of Sheboygan but very close in longitude.

Longitude determines east-west position.
- Sheboygan: around 87.71° W
- Chicago: around 87.62° W

87.62° W is east of 87.71° W because a lower degree west means further east. Wait, no:
- Longitude increases westward. So, 87.71° W is west of 87.62° W.
- Actually, in the Western Hemisphere, higher numbers mean further west. For example, 90° W is west of 80° W.

Standard: Lines of longitude go from 0° at Greenwich to 180° E and 180° W. So, for two points in the US:
- A point at 87° W is east of a point at 88° W.

Specifically:
- Sheboygan, WI: Longitude approximately 87.71° W
- Chicago, IL: Longitude approximately 87.63° W (let me double-check: actually, Chicago is about 87.62° W)

Upon second thought:
- Chicago is at about 87.6298° W
- Sheboygan is at about 87.7145° W

So, 87.7145° W (Sheboygan) is greater than 87.6298° W (Chicago), which means Sheboygan is further west than Chicago.

In longitude, a higher degree west means further west. So:
- 87.7145° W is west of 87.6298° W.

Yes! So, Sheboygan is at 87.71° W, and Chicago is at 87.63° W, so Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

Therefore, if The Ort Institute is in Chicago or somewhere in eastern Illinois, it would be east of Sheboygan.

The question is: Is The Ort Institute, IL west of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI?

If The Ort Institute is in Illinois, say Chicago, then no, it's east of Sheboygan.

Is The Ort Institute specifically in Chicago? I don't know. Maybe it's in western Illinois.

The name "The Ort Institute" – upon quick reflection, I think it might be a misspelling or fictional. Perhaps it's "The Art Institute," which is in Chicago.

Assuming it's in Illinois, I need to generalize.

Illinois spans from about 87° W to 91° W or so.
- Eastern Illinois: around 87° W (Chicago area)
- Western Illinois: up to about 91° W (near the Mississippi River)

Sheboygan is at 87.71° W, so parts of Illinois east of that would be east, and parts west would be west.

Most of Illinois is south of Wisconsin, but for east-west, Chicago is east of Sheboygan.

From my earlier check:
- Chicago (87.63° W) is east of Sheboygan (87.71° W).

So, if The Ort Institute is in eastern Illinois, like Chicago, then it's east of Sheboygan, not west.

If it's in western Illinois, say Rock Island, which is around 90.58° W, that would be west of Sheboygan (87.71° W).

90.58° W is further west than 87.71° W, yes.

So, it depends on where exactly in Illinois it is.

The question just says "The Ort Institute, IL," without specifying the city. This is ambiguous.

In the context, I need to assume it's a well-known institute or use the most likely location.

Upon thinking, I believe "The Ort Institute" might not be real, or perhaps it's "ORT Institute," which could be related to education, but I'm not sure. Upon quick mental search, there's ORT Brazil or something, but in the US, it's unclear.

Perhaps it's a typo for "The Art Institute of Chicago."

For the purpose of this exercise, since the user specified "IL," and without more info, I should consider the state as a whole, but that's not helpful.

The question expects me to know or assume it's in a major city like Chicago.

In my reasoning, if it's in Chicago, then no, it's not west of Sheboygan.

To be precise, let's confirm the longitudes:

- Sheboygan, WI: 87.7145° W

- If The Ort Institute is in Chicago: 87.6298° W, which is east of 87.7145° W.

So, Chicago is east of Sheboygan.

Therefore, The Ort Institute in IL (assuming Chicago) is not west of Sheboygan; it's east.

So, the answer should be No.

If it's in western IL, it could be yes, but I think the default assumption is eastern IL.

The question is phrased as "The Ort Institute, IL," similar to how the other is "University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI," so likely referring to a specific location in IL, probably Chicago.

My final reasoning:
1. Locate Sheboygan, WI: Eastern Wisconsin, longitude approx. 87.71° W.
2. Assume The Ort Institute is in Illinois, likely Chicago, longitude approx. 87.63° W.
3. Compare: 87.63° W is east of 87.71° W.
4. Therefore, The Ort Institute is not west of Sheboygan; it's east.

Final answer: No.

Below is my step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether The Ort Institute in Illinois (IL) is located west of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan in Wisconsin (WI). I'll base this on geographical data, including approximate longitudes, as longitude is the key factor for east-west comparisons.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations:**
   - The University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Sheboygan is in eastern Wisconsin, near Lake Michigan. Its approximate coordinates are 43.75° N, 87.71° W.
   - The Ort Institute, IL: This appears to be a less common or potentially unclear reference. Based on the abbreviation "IL," it is in Illinois. However, I couldn't find a well-known institution by this exact name. It might be a typo, misspelling, or lesser-known entity (e.g., possibly related to "ORT" as in educational organizations, or a confusion with "The Art Institute," which is in Chicago). For this analysis, I'll assume it's in Illinois and use Chicago as a reasonable default, as it's the most populous city in the state and often associated with Illinois-based institutions. Chicago's approximate coordinates are 41.88° N, 87.63° W.

2. **Understand east-west positioning:**
   - East-west position is determined by longitude. In the Western Hemisphere, a higher longitude value (e.g., 88° W) is further west than a lower one (e.g., 87° W). So, to check if Location A is west of Location B, we compare their longitudes: if Location A's longitude is greater than Location B's, then A is west of B.
   - Sheboygan, WI: Longitude ≈ 87.71° W.
   - The Ort Institute (assuming Chicago, IL): Longitude ≈ 87.63° W.

3. **Compare the longitudes:**
   - Sheboygan's longitude: 87.71° W.
   - Chicago's longitude: 87.63° W.
   - 87.63° W (Chicago) is less than 87.71° W (Sheboygan), which means Chicago is east of Sheboygan, not west.
   - If The Ort Institute is indeed in Chicago or another eastern part of Illinois (e.g., near Chicago), it would be east of Sheboygan.

4. **Consider other possibilities in Illinois:**
   - Illinois spans a range of longitudes, from about 87° W in the east (e.g., Chicago area) to about 91° W in the west (e.g., near the Mississippi River in western Illinois).
   - If The Ort Institute were in western Illinois (e.g., a city like Rock Island at ≈ 90.58° W), it could be west of Sheboygan (87.71° W). However, without specific information, the most common assumption for an Illinois-based institution is eastern Illinois, like Chicago.
   - Given the lack of clarity on the exact location, I'll proceed with the Chicago assumption, as it's the most likely based on typical references.

5. **Conclusion based on the analysis:**
   - Assuming The Ort Institute is in eastern Illinois (e.g., Chicago), it is not west of Sheboygan; it is east.
   - Therefore, the answer is No.

### Final Answer:
No
