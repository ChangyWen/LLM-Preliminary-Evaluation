*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the user is asking if one article was published earlier than another. The articles are:

1. "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal."

2. "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained."

I need to determine which one was published first and answer Yes or No based on that.

The question is: Was 'Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal.' published earlier than 'Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained.'?

If the first one was published before the second one, the answer is Yes. Otherwise, No.

I don't have actual publication dates for these articles. These sound like headlines from The New York Times or similar sources. As an AI, I might have general knowledge or access to data, but in this context, I need to simulate reasoning based on what I know.

From my training data, I recall that:

- "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal" is likely from around 2011, related to US politics and the debt ceiling crisis.

- "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained" sounds like it could be from a more recent time, possibly related to Russian politics. I think this might be about Alexei Navalny or similar activists, which was in the 2010s or 2020s.

Let me try to pinpoint:

- The first headline: I believe this is from July 2011, during the US debt ceiling negotiations.

- The second headline: For Moscow's mayor election, Alexei Navalny ran in 2013, and he was detained around that time.

Upon double-checking my knowledge:

- The US debt ceiling crisis of 2011 involved deadlines for recess and deficit deals, so that headline is from 2011.

- Alexei Navalny was detained multiple times, but specifically for running for Mayor of Moscow in 2013. He was barred from running in some cases, but I think there was a detention in 2013.

So, 2011 vs. 2013. That means the first one (2011) was published earlier than the second one (2013).

Is that accurate? Let me confirm:

- Upon reflection, the exact headline "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal" is from The New York Times on July 21, 2011.

- For the second, "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained" â€“ I believe this refers to an article from September 17, 2013, about Navalny being detained.

Yes, so 2011 is earlier than 2013.

Therefore, the first article was published earlier than the second.

So, the answer should be Yes.

The user asked to show step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the two headlines and the question.

2. Recall or know the approximate publication dates.

3. Compare the dates.

4. Conclude based on the comparison.

Final answer: Yes.
