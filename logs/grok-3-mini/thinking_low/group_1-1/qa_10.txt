*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Was Beastie Boys’s Jimmy James released earlier than Dream Theater’s Pull Me Under? Show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

I need to compare the release dates of two songs:

1. Beastie Boys’s "Jimmy James"

2. Dream Theater’s "Pull Me Under"

I should recall or look up the release dates. As an AI, I have access to general knowledge up to my last training data, which includes music history.

From my knowledge:

- Beastie Boys’s "Jimmy James" is from their album "Check Your Head." The album "Check Your Head" was released in 1992.

- Specifically, "Jimmy James" was released as a single in 1992. I believe it was in the summer of 1992.

- Dream Theater’s "Pull Me Under" is from their album "Images and Words." That album was released in 1992 as well.

Both are from 1992? I need to be precise.

Let me double-check:

- Beastie Boys’s "Check Your Head" album was released on April 21, 1992. "Jimmy James" is a track from that album and was released as a single shortly after. I think the single was released in June 1992.

Upon second thought, I need accurate dates:

- For "Jimmy James": It was released as a single on July 14, 1992, in the UK, and possibly earlier in the US.

I should confirm the exact dates.

- For Dream Theater’s "Pull Me Under": It was released as a single from the album "Images and Words," which came out on July 7, 1992, in Europe and July 28, 1992, in the US. "Pull Me Under" was the lead single and was released prior to the album or around the same time.

This is getting confusing. Let me clarify.

Upon accurate recollection:

- Dream Theater's "Images and Words" album was released on July 7, 1992.

- "Pull Me Under" was released as a single in August 1992, I think. Wait, no.

Actually, "Pull Me Under" was released as a single in 1992, but let's get the exact date.

From my knowledge:

- "Pull Me Under" single was released on August 24, 1992, in the US.

I need to be precise for comparison.

Perhaps I should list the dates I know:

- Beastie Boys’s "Check Your Head" album: April 21, 1992.

- "Jimmy James" as a single: It was released in June 1992. Upon checking my internal data, the single for "Jimmy James" was released on June 15, 1992, in the US.

Is that accurate? Let me think.

Actually, upon double-checking, Beastie Boys’s "Jimmy James" single was released in 1992, but the exact date might be July 1992.

This is tricky without real-time access, but based on standard knowledge:

- Beastie Boys’s "Jimmy James" single: Released in July 1992.

- Dream Theater’s "Pull Me Under" single: Released on August 24, 1992.

Yes, that seems right.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the release date of Beastie Boys’s "Jimmy James".

   - From "Check Your Head" album (April 21, 1992).

   - Single release: Approximately July 1992. Let's say July 14, 1992, for the UK single, but in the US, it might be earlier.

   To be precise, the US single for "Jimmy James" was released on June 15, 1992. Is that correct? Upon second thought, I'm not sure.

   Actually, upon correction, the album was out in April, and singles from it were released later. Let's assume the single was in mid-1992.

2. Identify the release date of Dream Theater’s "Pull Me Under".

   - From "Images and Words" album (July 7, 1992 in Europe, July 28, 1992 in the US).

   - The single "Pull Me Under" was released on August 24, 1992.

So, if "Jimmy James" single was released before August 24, 1992, then yes.

From reliable sources in my knowledge:

- Beastie Boys’s "Jimmy James" single was released in 1992, specifically, it was promoted with the album in April, but the single might have been later.

This is confusing. Perhaps I need to clarify if we're talking about the song's release as part of the album or as a single.

The question says "released," which could mean the album release or the single release. Typically, for songs, it's the single release if applicable.

To be accurate:

- For "Jimmy James," the song was first available on the album "Check Your Head" on April 21, 1992.

- For "Pull Me Under," the song was first available on the album "Images and Words" on July 7, 1992 (Europe) or July 28, 1992 (US).

If we're considering the album release, then "Jimmy James" was released earlier because April 21, 1992, is before July 7, 1992.

The question might be referring to the single releases.

The question: "Beastie Boys’s Jimmy James released earlier than Dream Theater’s Pull Me Under?"

It doesn't specify album or single, but in music context, it's often the single.

However, for "Pull Me Under," the single was in August, while the album was in July.

For "Jimmy James," if the single was after the album, but the song was on the album.

This is ambiguous. I think the standard is the first release of the song, which is on the album.

So, "Jimmy James" was first released on April 21, 1992.

"Pull Me Under" was first released on July 7, 1992.

Therefore, yes, "Jimmy James" was released earlier.

If we consider single releases:

- "Jimmy James" single: Let's say it was released in June or July 1992.

Upon final recollection, the "Jimmy James" single was released on July 13, 1992, in the UK, and perhaps earlier in the US.

"Pull Me Under" single: August 24, 1992.

So, even for singles, "Jimmy James" was earlier.

Therefore, the answer is Yes.

Final step-by-step:

1. Determine release date of "Jimmy James": April 21, 1992 (album), and single in July 1992.

2. Determine release date of "Pull Me Under": July 7, 1992 (album), and single in August 1992.

3. Compare: April 21, 1992, is earlier than July 7, 1992.

So, Yes.
