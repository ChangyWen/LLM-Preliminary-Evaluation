*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan located south of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

There's a potential issue here. Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Let me double-check that. Yes, Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. Manhattan is a separate borough.

The question specifies "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" and "HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan." Is there a Williamsburg in Manhattan? I don't think so. Williamsburg is definitely in Brooklyn.

Hillman Houses – I believe that's a housing project in Manhattan. Let me confirm: Hillman Housing is located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

So, if Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, and the question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," that might be a mistake. Perhaps the user meant Williamsburg Bridge or something, but as stated, it's "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan."

Assuming the question is as is, I need to interpret it literally. If there's no Williamsburg in Manhattan, then this might be a trick question.

Perhaps it's a typo, and they mean something else. But I have to go by what's written.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the locations:
   - Williamsburg: Typically in Brooklyn. Is there a Williamsburg in Manhattan? Upon quick mental search, no, there isn't. The famous one is in Brooklyn.
   - Hillman Houses: This is in Manhattan, specifically in the Lower East Side.

2. If Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, then "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" doesn't exist. So, is the question invalid?

3. The question asks if one is south of the other, both specified in Manhattan. Since Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan, I can't compare their positions in Manhattan.

4. Perhaps the user means the Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn and is comparing it to Hillman Houses in Manhattan.

But the question explicitly says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which is incorrect.

To answer accurately:

- Hillman Houses are in Manhattan, around East Houston Street and Avenue D, in the Lower East Side.

- Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, north of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, across the East River from Manhattan.

If I consider the actual locations:

- Hillman Houses in Manhattan are roughly at latitude around 40.719 N.

- Williamsburg in Brooklyn is also around 40.714 N, but let's think about their positions relative to each other.

Manhattan's Lower East Side is south of Midtown, and Williamsburg is across the river, directly east of the Lower East Side.

In terms of north-south, Williamsburg is roughly at the same latitude as the Lower East Side of Manhattan. For example:

- Lower East Side (Hillman Houses): Around 40.72 N.

- Williamsburg: Also around 40.71-40.72 N.

So, geographically, Williamsburg is not south of Hillman Houses; it's east of it, across the river.

To be precise:

- If I take a point in Williamsburg, say the Williamsburg Bridge, which connects to Delancey Street in Lower East Side.

- So, Williamsburg is north-east of Hillman Houses, but not south.

Hillman Houses are on the Lower East Side, which is south of Central Park, and Williamsburg is further north in Brooklyn? No.

Let's clarify:

- The Lower East Side is in southern Manhattan.

- Williamsburg is in northern Brooklyn, directly across from the Lower East Side.

In terms of latitude:

- Southern Manhattan (Lower East Side) is at about 40.71 N.

- Williamsburg is at about 40.71 N as well; it's not north or south, it's east.

Upon second thought, the Lower East Side is at the same latitude as parts of Williamsburg.

For example, the southern part of Williamsburg is opposite the Lower East Side.

So, is Williamsburg south of Hillman Houses? No, because Hillman Houses are in the Lower East Side, and Williamsburg is across the river, not south.

South of Lower East Side would be places like the Financial District or Battery Park in Manhattan, or Staten Island further south.

Williamsburg is to the east, not south.

Therefore, even if we consider the actual locations, Williamsburg (in Brooklyn) is not south of Hillman Houses (in Manhattan).

So, the answer should be No.

The question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which doesn't exist. However, to provide a useful answer, I'll assume they mean the actual Williamsburg.

Perhaps in the context, it's a error, and I should base it on real geography.

Final reasoning:

- Hillman Houses are in Manhattan's Lower East Side.

- Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, east of Lower East Side.

- Therefore, Williamsburg is not located south of Hillman Houses; it's east.

So, the answer is No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
I'll reason through your query step by step based on accurate geographical knowledge of New York City. The question asks whether "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" is located south of "HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan." Let's break this down:

### Step 1: Identify the locations
- **WILLIAMSBURG**: This is typically a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. There is no recognized neighborhood or area called "Williamsburg" in Manhattan. It's possible this is a misunderstanding or typo, as Williamsburg is a well-known area in Brooklyn, situated along the East River and north of Brooklyn's downtown areas.
- **HILLMAN HOUSES**: This refers to a public housing development in Manhattan, specifically in the Lower East Side. It's located around East Houston Street and Avenue D, in the southeastern part of Manhattan.

Since the query specifies "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which does not exist as a valid location, we have a potential inconsistency. For the sake of analysis, I'll assume you might mean the actual Williamsburg in Brooklyn and compare it to Hillman Houses in Manhattan, as that's the most logical interpretation.

### Step 2: Determine the relative positions
- **Hillman Houses (Manhattan)**: This area is in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, with coordinates approximately around 40.719° N latitude and 73.978° W longitude. It's in the southern part of Manhattan, south of Midtown and Central Park.
- **Williamsburg (Brooklyn)**: If we're referring to the actual Williamsburg, it's in Brooklyn, with its main areas around 40.714° N latitude and 73.966° W longitude. It's directly across the East River from Manhattan's Lower East Side, making it east of Hillman Houses rather than north, south, or west.

In terms of direction:
- South of Hillman Houses would mean locations further down in latitude (e.g., toward the Financial District in Manhattan or even Staten Island).
- Williamsburg, however, is not south; it's primarily east of Hillman Houses, across the East River. The two areas are at roughly similar latitudes (around 40.71–40.72° N), so Williamsburg isn't noticeably north or south—it's more eastward.

### Step 3: Address the specific query
- The query asks if "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" is south of "HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan." Since "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" doesn't exist, we can't directly compare it as stated.
- If we interpret this as a reference to the real Williamsburg in Brooklyn, it is not located south of Hillman Houses; it's east of it.
- Therefore, based on standard geography, the answer is no.

### Final Answer
No
