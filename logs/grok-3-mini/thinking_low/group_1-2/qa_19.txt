*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Platte County, MO more populous than Eau Claire County, WI?" I need to compare the populations of these two counties.

I should recall or look up the population data. As an AI, I have access to general knowledge up to my last training data, which includes recent census data. Let's assume I have the latest available data.

From my knowledge:

- Platte County, MO: This is in Missouri. I believe its population is around 100,000 to 200,000. I think it's about 104,000 as of the 2020 census.

- Eau Claire County, WI: This is in Wisconsin. I recall it's the home of the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, and its population is also in a similar range. I think it's about 105,000 as of 2020.

I need to be precise. Let me double-check my internal data:

- According to the 2020 U.S. Census:

  - Platte County, Missouri: Population is 102,978.

  - Eau Claire County, Wisconsin: Population is 105,710.

If that's accurate, then Eau Claire County has a higher population than Platte County.

So, is Platte County more populous? No, because 102,978 < 105,710.

I should confirm these numbers. In reality, based on standard knowledge:

- Platte County, MO: Yes, 2020 census shows 102,978.

- Eau Claire County, WI: 2020 census shows 105,710.

Therefore, Platte County is less populous.

The question asks for a step-by-step reasoning process and a final answer of Yes or No.

Step-by-step:

1. Identify the counties: Platte County in Missouri and Eau Claire County in Wisconsin.

2. Recall or access population data from a reliable source, such as the U.S. Census Bureau.

3. Compare the populations:

   - Population of Platte County, MO: 102,978 (as per 2020 census).

   - Population of Eau Claire County, WI: 105,710 (as per 2020 census).

4. Determine if Platte County's population is greater than Eau Claire County's.

   - 102,978 > 105,710? No, it's not.

5. Therefore, the answer is No.

I should note that population can change, but since the question doesn't specify a year, I'll use the most recent standard data.

Final answer: No.

Below is my step-by-step reasoning process for answering the query: "Is Platte County, MO more populous than Eau Claire County, WI?"

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the key elements of the query**: The question requires comparing the populations of two U.S. countiesâ€”Platte County in Missouri (MO) and Eau Claire County in Wisconsin (WI). I need to determine if the population of Platte County is greater than that of Eau Claire County.

2. **Gather population data**: I will use reliable data from the U.S. Census Bureau, specifically the 2020 Census, as it is the most recent comprehensive count available. Population figures can fluctuate over time, but this data provides a standard baseline.
   - Population of Platte County, MO: According to the 2020 U.S. Census, Platte County has a population of 102,978.
   - Population of Eau Claire County, WI: According to the 2020 U.S. Census, Eau Claire County has a population of 105,710.

3. **Compare the populations**: Now, I compare the two figures:
   - Platte County, MO: 102,978
   - Eau Claire County, WI: 105,710
   - Is 102,978 greater than 105,710? No, 102,978 is less than 105,710.

4. **Consider any caveats**: Population data is based on estimates and can change due to factors like births, deaths, migration, or new census updates. However, based on the 2020 data, the comparison is clear. If more recent estimates (e.g., from the Census Bureau's annual updates) were available, they might show slight variations, but they are unlikely to reverse this conclusion.

5. **Draw a conclusion**: Since the population of Platte County (102,978) is not greater than the population of Eau Claire County (105,710), the answer to the query is "No."

### Final Answer:
No
