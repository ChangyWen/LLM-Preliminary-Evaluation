*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan located south of WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan?"

I need to clarify the locations. The question mentions "HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan" and "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan." But I know that Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Let me double-check that.

Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. Manhattan is a separate borough. So, is there a Williamsburg in Manhattan? I don't think so. Upon quick reflection, Williamsburg is definitely in Brooklyn.

Now, what about HILLMAN HOUSES? I believe Hillman Houses is a housing project in Manhattan. Let me confirm: Yes, Hillman Housing Project is located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

So, the question might have a mistake. It says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," but Williamsburg is in Brooklyn. Perhaps the user meant Williamsburg in Brooklyn.

The question specifies "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which is incorrect. I need to address this in my reasoning.

Assuming the question is as stated, I should base my answer on the given information. But geographically, if Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan, then comparing locations doesn't make sense.

Perhaps it's a typo, and they meant something else, like Washington Heights or another area.

Maybe they mean the Williamsburg Bridge, which connects Manhattan to Brooklyn, but that's not a location in Manhattan.

To answer accurately:

1. HILLMAN HOUSES is in Manhattan, specifically in the Lower East Side.

2. WILLIAMSBURG is in Brooklyn.

So, if we're comparing their locations, HILLMAN HOUSES in Manhattan and WILLIAMSBURG in Brooklyn, we need to see if Manhattan's Lower East Side is south of Brooklyn's Williamsburg.

Manhattan is generally north of Brooklyn, but let's think about it.

Actually, the Lower East Side of Manhattan is at the southern tip of Manhattan, and Williamsburg in Brooklyn is across the East River, to the east and slightly south of Lower Manhattan.

Let me visualize a map:

- Lower East Side, Manhattan: Around the southern part of Manhattan Island.

- Williamsburg, Brooklyn: North of Brooklyn, across from Lower East Side.

Is Williamsburg south of Lower East Side?

No. If you're in Lower East Side, Manhattan, and look across the East River, Williamsburg is directly east, but in terms of north-south, Manhattan's southern tip is at the Battery, and Williamsburg is roughly at the same latitude or slightly north.

Let's think about latitudes:

- Lower East Side is around 40.72° N.

- Williamsburg is also around 40.71° N to 40.72° N. They are very close in latitude.

More precisely, the southern part of Manhattan is south of Williamsburg.

No: The southern tip of Manhattan is at about 40.70° N, and Williamsburg is around 40.72° N, so Williamsburg is slightly north of the very southern part of Manhattan.

But HILLMAN HOUSES is in Lower East Side, which is not the very southern tip; it's more central south.

Upon second thought, Lower East Side is between about 14th Street and the southern tip, but specifically, Hillman Houses are near Delancey Street, which is around 40.718° N.

Williamsburg is from around 40.71° N northward.

This is getting too vague. I need a better way.

Generally, the Lower East Side of Manhattan is south of Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Is that true? No: If I take a point in Lower East Side and a point in Williamsburg, the one in Lower East Side is further south.

For example, Delancey Street in Manhattan is at approximately 40.718° N, and the main part of Williamsburg, like Bedford Avenue, is at about 40.714° N for some parts, but let's check.

Upon correction, Williamsburg's southern boundary is near the Brooklyn Navy Yard, which is around 40.70° N, but the heart of Williamsburg is north of that.

This is confusing without exact coordinates. From memory, Manhattan's Lower East Side is at the same latitude as northern Williamsburg.

But typically, when we say "south of," for neighborhoods, we consider the overall position.

The question is phrased as "HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan located south of WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan."

Since WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan doesn't exist, the answer should be no, because there's no such place.

That might be too literal. Perhaps the user meant Williamsburg in Brooklyn.

To be precise, I should say no, because Williamsburg is not in Manhattan.

If I assume it's a mistake and they mean the actual Williamsburg in Brooklyn, then is Hillman Houses south of Williamsburg?

Hillman Houses are in Lower East Side, Manhattan, which is west of Williamsburg and slightly south.

From standard knowledge, the Lower East Side is directly west of Williamsburg, across the East River, and the southern part of Lower East Side is at the same level as the southern part of Williamsburg.

But if I take the centroid or general location, Lower East Side is not south of Williamsburg; it's west.

The question is about north-south direction, not east-west.

So, is Lower East Side south of Williamsburg? No, they are at similar latitudes.

For example, the distance: From Google Maps or memory, the point in Lower East Side (say, near Hillman Houses at 40.718° N) and a point in Williamsburg (say, 40.716° N for some parts), they are very close.

But overall, the bulk of Williamsburg is north of the southern Manhattan.

This is tricky. Perhaps it's not south.

Upon thinking, the southernmost point of Manhattan is Battery Park at 40.70° N, and Williamsburg starts at around 40.71° N, so parts of Manhattan are south of Williamsburg.

But Hillman Houses are at about 40.718° N, and Williamsburg's southern part is at about 40.70° N as well? No.

Let's clarify: The East River separates them, and Lower East Side is at the same latitude as Williamsburg.

In fact, upon double-check, the Lower East Side is approximately at the same latitude as the central part of Williamsburg.

So, Hillman Houses are not south of Williamsburg; they are roughly at the same latitude, with Williamsburg being east.

Therefore, it's not located south of it.

To be accurate, for the question "located south of," it means entirely or generally south, which it's not.

Since the question specifies "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which doesn't exist, the answer is no.

I think the safest answer is no, because the location as stated doesn't exist.

So, my final reasoning: Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, so HILLMAN HOUSES cannot be south of a non-existent location in Manhattan. Therefore, the answer is No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations mentioned:**
   - HILLMAN HOUSES: This refers to the Hillman Housing Project, which is a public housing development located in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. Its approximate coordinates are around 40.718° N latitude.
   - WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan: Williamsburg is a well-known neighborhood, but it is located in Brooklyn, New York, not Manhattan. There is no neighborhood or area officially named Williamsburg in Manhattan. This could be a misunderstanding or typo in the query.

2. **Assess the validity of the comparison:**
   - Since the query specifies "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," we must evaluate based on that exact phrasing. If Williamsburg does not exist in Manhattan, it's impossible to compare the relative positions of HILLMAN HOUSES (in Manhattan) and a non-existent "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan."
   - For context, the actual Williamsburg in Brooklyn is situated across the East River from Manhattan's Lower East Side. Its latitude ranges from approximately 40.70° N to 40.72° N, similar to parts of the Lower East Side.

3. **Determine geographical relationship (if assuming a correction):**
   - If we hypothetically interpret "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" as a reference to the actual Williamsburg in Brooklyn, we can compare latitudes:
     - HILLMAN HOUSES (Lower East Side, Manhattan) is at about 40.718° N.
     - The actual Williamsburg (Brooklyn) is at roughly the same latitude (around 40.71° N to 40.72° N for its central areas).
     - Locations at similar latitudes are not considered "south of" each other; they are roughly aligned north-south. Therefore, HILLMAN HOUSES is not south of Williamsburg—it is west of it across the East River.
   - However, this interpretation contradicts the query's specification of "Manhattan," so it may not apply.

4. **Address the core issue:**
   - The query as stated is based on an inaccurate premise because "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" does not exist. Without a valid reference point in Manhattan, we cannot confirm that HILLMAN HOUSES is south of it.
   - In geographical terms, for one location to be "south of" another, it must be at a lower latitude. Since the comparison involves a non-existent location, the statement cannot be verified as true.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the query's wording, the answer must be "No" because there is no "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" to compare against.

### Final Answer:
No
