*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI located west of The Ort Institute, IL?"

I need to determine the geographical locations of these two places and compare their positions.

Key elements:

- University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI: This is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

- The Ort Institute, IL: This is in Illinois. I'm not familiar with "The Ort Institute." It might be a typo or an unfamiliar name. Could it be "The Art Institute" or something else? Upon quick reflection, I recall the Art Institute of Chicago in Illinois. Maybe it's a misspelling of that. For now, I'll assume it's in Illinois, as specified.

The question says "The Ort Institute, IL," so I'll treat it as a location in Illinois. To be precise, I need to know where in Illinois it is. Since it's not specified, I might need to assume a major city or the most likely one. If it's "The Ort Institute," it could be fictional or misspelled, but for this exercise, I'll proceed with it being in Illinois.

Common sense: Illinois is a state, and without a specific city, I should consider the general location. But to compare east-west, I need more detail.

Perhaps "The Ort Institute" is meant to be "The Art Institute of Chicago," which is in Chicago, Illinois. That seems plausible.

So, let's assume:

- University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

- The Ort Institute is in Chicago, Illinois (as a reasonable assumption).

Now, I need to compare their longitudes to see if Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

Recall approximate locations:

- Sheboygan, Wisconsin: It's on the western shore of Lake Michigan, north of Milwaukee. Its longitude is around 87.7° W.

- Chicago, Illinois: It's on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan. Its longitude is approximately 87.6° W to 87.7° W. Chicago is at about 87.62° W.

More precisely:

- Sheboygan, WI: Latitude 43.75° N, Longitude 87.71° W

- Chicago, IL: Latitude 41.88° N, Longitude 87.62° W

Comparing longitudes:

- Sheboygan: 87.71° W

- Chicago: 87.62° W

In the Western Hemisphere, a higher degree of longitude (e.g., 87.71° W vs. 87.62° W) means further west because longitude increases as you go west.

Longitude is measured from the Prime Meridian, so 87.71° W is west of 87.62° W. Yes, because 87.71 is greater than 87.62, so Sheboygan at 87.71° W is further west than Chicago at 87.62° W.

To clarify:

- Lines of longitude: 87.62° W is east of 87.71° W.

No: In the western hemisphere, a longitude of 87.71° W is west of 87.62° W because it's a larger angle from the Prime Meridian.

For example, 90° W is west of 80° W.

So, yes: 87.71° W is west of 87.62° W.

Therefore, Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

So, University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is located west of The Ort Institute (assuming in Chicago, IL).

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify locations:

   - University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan: Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

   - The Ort Institute: Assumed to be in Illinois, likely Chicago.

2. Find approximate longitudes:

   - Sheboygan, WI: ~87.71° W

   - Chicago, IL: ~87.62° W

3. Compare: 87.71° W > 87.62° W, so Sheboygan is further west.

4. Conclusion: Yes, it is located west of The Ort Institute.

I should confirm if "The Ort Institute" is indeed in Chicago. Upon second thought, if it's not, this could be wrong. But based on the question, it's the best assumption.

If "The Ort Institute" is in a different part of Illinois, say, further west like in Rockford or East St. Louis, that could change it. But since it's not specified, I'll stick with Chicago as the most prominent.

Finally, the answer should be Yes or No. Based on this, Yes.

Below is my step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI, is located west of The Ort Institute, IL. I'll base this on geographical data, including approximate longitudes, as east-west positioning is determined by longitude lines.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations:**
   - University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Sheboygan is a city on the western shore of Lake Michigan.
   - The Ort Institute, IL, is specified as being in Illinois. However, "The Ort Institute" does not appear to be a well-known or standard institution. It might be a typo, misspelling, or less common reference. For this analysis, I'll assume it refers to a location in Illinois, and the most reasonable assumption based on common institutions is that it could be something like the Art Institute (e.g., the Art Institute of Chicago). Thus, I'll use Chicago, Illinois, as a proxy for The Ort Institute's location, as it's a prominent institution in the state and aligns with the query's context.

2. **Gather geographical coordinates:**
   - Sheboygan, Wisconsin: Approximate coordinates are 43.75° N latitude and 87.71° W longitude.
   - Chicago, Illinois (assuming for The Ort Institute): Approximate coordinates are 41.88° N latitude and 87.62° W longitude.
   - Note: Longitude is the key factor for east-west comparison. In the Western Hemisphere, a higher longitude value (e.g., 87.71° W) indicates a position further west compared to a lower one (e.g., 87.62° W).

3. **Compare longitudes:**
   - Sheboygan's longitude: 87.71° W
   - Chicago's longitude: 87.62° W
   - Since 87.71° W is greater than 87.62° W, Sheboygan is located further west than Chicago. In other words, if you travel from Chicago toward Sheboygan, you are moving westward.

4. **Consider potential variations:**
   - If The Ort Institute is not in Chicago but in another part of Illinois (e.g., further west like in Rockford or Springfield), the answer could change. For instance:
     - Rockford, IL (western Illinois): ~89.09° W – In this case, Sheboygan would be east of Rockford, making the answer "No."
     - However, without specific details, Chicago is a reasonable default assumption based on prominence.
   - This analysis is based on approximate values, which are sufficient for a general east-west comparison but not precise for exact measurements.

5. **Conclusion based on the assumption:**
   - Using the assumption that The Ort Institute is in Chicago, IL, Sheboygan, WI, is indeed west of it.

### Final Answer:
Yes
