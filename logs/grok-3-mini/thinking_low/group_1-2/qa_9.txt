*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Did William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey die later than Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy?" I need to answer with Yes or No, and show my step-by-step reasoning.

I need to recall or look up the death dates of these two historical figures. Since I'm an AI, I have access to general knowledge.

Let me think about William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. He was a Norman nobleman, involved in the Norman Conquest. I believe he died in 1088.

Now, Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy. She was a French noblewoman. I think she was married to Peter I of Savoy and died in 1097.

I need to confirm these dates accurately.

From my knowledge:

- William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, was born around 1030-1040 and died on June 24, 1088.

- Agnes of Aquitaine was the daughter of William VIII, Duke of Aquitaine. She married Peter I of Savoy and died on November 6, 1097.

If William died in 1088 and Agnes died in 1097, then yes, William died earlier than Agnes, so he did not die later than her.

The question is: "Did William de Warenne die later than Agnes?" If William died in 1088 and Agnes in 1097, then 1088 is before 1097, so William died earlier. Therefore, the answer is No.

I should double-check the dates to ensure accuracy.

Upon second thought, is Agnes of Aquitaine the correct person? There might be confusion with names. Agnes of Aquitaine could refer to different people. Let me clarify.

Actually, Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy, was indeed the wife of Peter I of Savoy, and she died in 1097.

And William de Warenne died in 1088.

Yes, that seems correct.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the death date of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey.

   - From historical records, he died on 24 June 1088.

2. Identify the death date of Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy.

   - She died on 6 November 1097.

3. Compare the two dates.

   - 1088 is earlier than 1097.

4. Determine if William died later than Agnes.

   - Since 1088 < 1097, William died before Agnes.

5. Therefore, the answer is No.

Final answer should be straightforward: Yes or No.

So, my response will be:

- Step-by-step reasoning as above.

- Final answer: No.
