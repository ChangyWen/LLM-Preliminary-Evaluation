*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is 97233, OR located west of 98580, WA?" I need to determine if the location with ZIP code 97233 in Oregon is west of the location with ZIP code 98580 in Washington. I should provide a step-by-step reasoning process and end with a final answer of "Yes" or "No".

Key elements:
- 97233 is in OR (Oregon)
- 98580 is in WA (Washington)

I need to compare their geographical positions, specifically if 97233, OR is west of 98580, WA.

To do this, I should recall or look up the general locations of these ZIP codes.

From my knowledge:
- Oregon (OR) is on the West Coast of the USA.
- Washington (WA) is also on the West Coast, directly north of Oregon.

More precisely:
- ZIP code 97233: I believe this is in Portland, Oregon. Portland is in the northwest part of Oregon.
- ZIP code 98580: This might be in Washington. Let me think – 98580 sounds like it's in the Olympia area or nearby. Upon double-checking my knowledge, 98580 is in Washington, specifically in the Tumwater or Olympia region, which is in western Washington.

General geography:
- Oregon is south of Washington.
- Portland, OR (where 97233 is) is in the northern part of Oregon, near the border with Washington.
- Olympia, WA (where 98580 is) is in the southwestern part of Washington, also near the border.

To be accurate:
- Portland, OR is at approximately 45.5° N latitude and 122.6° W longitude.
- Olympia, WA is at about 47.0° N latitude and 122.9° W longitude.

Longitude determines east-west position:
- West is indicated by higher longitude values in the Western Hemisphere (e.g., 122.9° W is west of 122.6° W).

Longitude increases as you go west in the Western Hemisphere. So, a higher number like 122.9° W is further west than 122.6° W.

Standard convention: Longitude is measured from 0° at Greenwich, and in the west, it's negative or denoted as W. So, 122.9° W is west of 122.6° W because 122.9 is a larger number, meaning further west.

For example:
- New York is around 74° W.
- Los Angeles is around 118° W, which is west of New York.

So, yes, higher longitude values in the west mean further west.

For Portland, OR: Approximately 122.68° W
For Olympia, WA: Approximately 122.90° W

I need to confirm these:
- Actual for Portland: Around 122.67° W
- For Olympia: Around 122.89° W

So, 122.89° W (Olympia) is greater than 122.67° W (Portland), meaning Olympia is further west than Portland.

Therefore, Portland, OR (97233) is east of Olympia, WA (98580).

The question is: Is 97233, OR located west of 98580, WA?

If Portland is east of Olympia, then 97233, OR is not west of 98580, WA; it's east of it.

To clarify:
- If A is west of B, that means A has a higher longitude value than B in the west.

So, for 98580, WA (Olympia, ~122.89° W) and 97233, OR (Portland, ~122.67° W), since 122.67° W is less than 122.89° W, Portland is east of Olympia.

Therefore, 97233, OR is east of 98580, WA, not west.

So, the answer should be "No".

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the locations:
   - 97233 is a ZIP code in Portland, Oregon.
   - 98580 is a ZIP code in Tumwater or Olympia, Washington.

2. Determine the approximate longitudes:
   - Portland, OR: Approximately 122.67° W
   - Olympia, WA: Approximately 122.89° W

3. Compare longitudes:
   - A location with longitude 122.89° W is west of a location with 122.67° W.

4. Therefore, 97233, OR (122.67° W) is east of 98580, WA (122.89° W).

5. So, 97233, OR is not located west of 98580, WA.

Final answer: No

**************************************** Content ***************************************
Below is my step-by-step reasoning process to determine if the location with ZIP code 97233 in Oregon (OR) is west of the location with ZIP code 98580 in Washington (WA). I'll base this on general geographical knowledge of the United States, including approximate longitudes, as longitude is the key factor for east-west comparisons.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations of the ZIP codes:**
   - ZIP code 97233 is located in Gresham, which is a suburb of Portland, Oregon. Portland is in the northwestern part of Oregon.
   - ZIP code 98580 is located in Tumwater, which is near Olympia, the capital of Washington. This area is in the southwestern part of Washington state.

2. **Understand the geography of Oregon and Washington:**
   - Oregon is directly south of Washington, and both states are on the West Coast of the United States.
   - To determine if one location is west of another, we compare their longitudes. Longitude lines run north-south, and in the Western Hemisphere, a higher longitude value (e.g., 122.9° W) indicates a position further west compared to a lower one (e.g., 122.6° W).

3. **Approximate the longitudes:**
   - Based on standard geographical data:
     - Portland, OR (where 97233 is located) has an approximate longitude of 122.67° W.
     - Tumwater/Olympia, WA (where 98580 is located) has an approximate longitude of 122.89° W.
   - Note: These are rough averages for the areas, but they are sufficient for a relative east-west comparison.

4. **Compare the longitudes:**
   - 122.89° W (98580, WA) is greater than 122.67° W (97233, OR).
   - In the Western Hemisphere, a higher longitude value means the location is further west. Therefore, 98580, WA is west of 97233, OR.
   - This means 97233, OR is actually east of 98580, WA, not west of it.

5. **Consider any other factors:**
   - While latitude (north-south position) could affect overall distance, the question specifically asks about east-west positioning, so longitude is the primary metric.
   - Both locations are relatively close to each other across the state border, but the longitude comparison confirms the relative positions.

### Final Answer:
No
