*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV located east of Pine Flat Dam, CA?"

I need to determine the geographical locations of these two places and compare their positions.

Key elements:
- St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church is in NV, which is Nevada.
- Pine Flat Dam is in CA, which is California.

I need to know the exact or approximate locations:
- St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church: I believe this is in Virginia City, Nevada. Virginia City is a historic town in Nevada, known for its mining history, and there's a church by that name there.
- Pine Flat Dam: This is in California, specifically in Fresno County, on the Kings River. It's a reservoir in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Now, to compare if one is east of the other:
- Nevada is generally east of California. California is on the west coast, and Nevada is inland to the east.
- More precisely, Virginia City, NV, is in western Nevada, near the border with California.
- Pine Flat Dam is in central California, in the Sierra Nevada range, which is east of the Central Valley but still in California.

Let me visualize a map:
- California: West coast state.
  - Pine Flat Dam is in eastern Fresno County, which is in the central part of California, near the Sierra Nevada mountains.
- Nevada: East of California.
  - Virginia City, NV, is in western Nevada, close to Lake Tahoe, which is on the border between California and Nevada.

Lake Tahoe is straddled by both states, with the western part in California and the eastern in Nevada. Virginia City is northeast of Lake Tahoe, in Nevada.

So, roughly:
- Pine Flat Dam is southeast of Sacramento, in the Sierra Nevada.
- Virginia City is east of the Sierra Nevada, in Nevada.

Is Virginia City east of Pine Flat Dam?
- Pine Flat Dam is in the Sierra Nevada mountains, which run north-south through eastern California.
- Virginia City is on the other side of the Sierra Nevada, in Nevada.

From Pine Flat Dam, which is in California, going east would take you over the Sierra Nevada into Nevada, where Virginia City is located.

Let me confirm approximate coordinates:
- Pine Flat Dam: Around 36.8° N, 119.1° W (Fresno area).
- Virginia City, NV: Around 39.3° N, 119.6° W.

Virginia City is at about 39.31° N, 119.65° W.
Pine Flat Dam is at about 36.85° N, 119.07° W.

To determine if one is east of the other, I need to compare longitudes, since east-west is along lines of longitude.

Longitude:
- Pine Flat Dam: 119.07° W
- Virginia City: 119.65° W

119.65° W is west of 119.07° W because higher degrees west mean further west.

Longitude increases westward in the Western Hemisphere. So, 119.65° W is further west than 119.07° W.

Standard longitude: Lower numbers (closer to 0) are east, higher numbers west.

In the Western Hemisphere, longitudes are negative or denoted as W, and a higher number like 120° W is west of 119° W.

So:
- 119.07° W is at 119.07 degrees west.
- 119.65° W is at 119.65 degrees west, which is further west than 119.07° W.

Therefore, Virginia City at 119.65° W is west of Pine Flat Dam at 119.07° W.

That means St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church in Virginia City, NV, is west of Pine Flat Dam, CA, not east.

Is that accurate? Let me double-check the locations.

Pine Flat Dam is in Fresno County, CA, which is around 119° W, but let's confirm:
Fresno is at about 119.77° W for the city, but Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno, so actually, Fresno is at 119.77° W, and Pine Flat Dam is further east, so lower longitude number.

Longitude decreases as you go east in the west.

Standard: Going east, longitude decreases (from e.g., 120° W to 119° W).

Upon second thought:
- The Pacific coast is around 124° W, and it goes east to 114° W or so for the eastern border of California.

More precisely:
- Los Angeles is about 118° W.
- San Francisco is about 122° W.
- Fresno is approximately 119.8° W.
- Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno, so it should be around 119.0° W or less.

Earlier I said 119.07° W, which is east of 119.8° W.

Yes: 119.07° W is east of 119.8° W because 119.07 is less than 119.8, so closer to the Prime Meridian in terms of absolute value, but since it's W, lower number means east.

To clarify: In the Western Hemisphere, a longitude of 119° W is east of 120° W.

So, for Pine Flat Dam: If it's at 119.07° W, and Virginia City at 119.65° W, then 119.07° W is east of 119.65° W.

No:
- 119.65° W is west of 119.07° W because 119.65 > 119.07, so it's further west.

Yes: For example, 120° W is west of 119° W.

So, 119.65° W is west of 119.07° W.

Therefore, Virginia City (119.65° W) is west of Pine Flat Dam (119.07° W).

But that can't be right because Nevada is east of California.

Virginia City is in Nevada, which is east of California, but let's check the longitudes again.

I think I have the longitudes wrong for Virginia City.

Upon second thought, Reno, NV, is at about 119.81° W, and Virginia City is near Reno, so around 119.65° W sounds right, but is that east or west of Pine Flat Dam?

Pine Flat Dam is in California, east of Fresno. Fresno is at 119.78° W, and Pine Flat Dam is at approximately 119.07° W, which is east of Fresno because the Sierra Nevada is east, so lower longitude number.

Yes, so Pine Flat Dam at 119.07° W is east of Fresno at 119.78° W.

Virginia City is at 119.65° W, which is west of Pine Flat Dam at 119.07° W, because 119.65 > 119.07.

That would mean Virginia City is west of Pine Flat Dam, but that doesn't make sense geographically.

Perhaps I have the longitude for Pine Flat Dam wrong.

Let me think again. Upon double-checking my knowledge, I believe Pine Flat Dam is at about 36.85° N, 119.07° W, and Virginia City is at 39.31° N, 119.65° W.

So, comparing longitudes: 119.07° W vs 119.65° W.

Since 119.65° W is greater than 119.07° W, 119.65° W is further west.

So, Virginia City is at 119.65° W, which is west of 119.07° W (Pine Flat Dam).

But that means St. Mary’s in the Mountains is west of Pine Flat Dam.

Is that accurate? Let's confirm with a map in mind.

Actually, the Sierra Nevada runs north-south, and Pine Flat Dam is in the southern Sierra, while Virginia City is north of Lake Tahoe, which is in the northern Sierra.

So, Lake Tahoe is at about 119.9° W for the Nevada side.

Perhaps I need to accept that based on the numbers, Virginia City is west of Pine Flat Dam.

But that seems counterintuitive because Nevada is east of California.

No: For the northern part, Reno and Virginia City are east of the Sierra Nevada, while Pine Flat Dam is in the Sierra Nevada in California.

Let's clarify: The Sierra Nevada is in California, so east of the Sierra is Nevada.

For example, the eastern slope of the Sierra in the north is where Reno is.

So, for the latitude of Reno (around 39° N), the Sierra crest is at about 119.5° W or so, and Reno is at 119.8° W, which is east of the crest.

I think I have it: The Sierra crest at the latitude of Lake Tahoe (39° N) is around 120° W on the west side, but let's get this straight.

Upon correction, San Francisco is at 122° W, Sacramento at 121° W, Tahoe at about 120° W, and Reno at 119.8° W, so Reno is east of Tahoe.

Pine Flat Dam is at 36.85° N, which is south, near Fresno at 36.7° N, 119.7° W, and Pine Flat is east of that, so at 119.07° W, which is east of Fresno's 119.7° W.

For Virginia City at 39.31° N, 119.65° W, and the Sierra crest at that latitude is around 119.5° W or so, so Virginia City at 119.65° W is east of the crest.

To compare directly, since they are at different latitudes, "east of" is not straightforward, but the question likely means in terms of longitude, assuming the same latitude or generally.

Since Virginia City is at 119.65° W and Pine Flat Dam at 119.07° W, and 119.65° W is west of 119.07° W, so St. Mary’s is west of Pine Flat Dam.

That means the answer is No, it's not east.

Perhaps the question implies overall direction.

Maybe I should conclude based on the longitude comparison.

So, step-by-step:
1. Locate St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church: Virginia City, NV, approximately 39.31° N, 119.65° W.
2. Locate Pine Flat Dam: Fresno County, CA, approximately 36.85° N, 119.07° W.
3. Compare longitudes: 119.65° W vs 119.07° W.
4. Since 119.65° W is greater than 119.07° W, Virginia City is further west than Pine Flat Dam.
5. Therefore, St. Mary’s is west of Pine Flat Dam, not east.

So, the final answer is No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
Below is my step-by-step reasoning process to determine whether St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church in NV is located east of Pine Flat Dam in CA. I'll base this on geographical data, including approximate coordinates, to ensure accuracy.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations:**
   - St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church is located in Virginia City, Nevada (NV). Virginia City is a historic town in western Nevada.
     - Approximate coordinates: 39.31° N, 119.65° W.
   - Pine Flat Dam is located in Fresno County, California (CA), on the Kings River in the Sierra Nevada mountains.
     - Approximate coordinates: 36.85° N, 119.07° W.

2. **Understand the concept of "east" in geography:**
   - To determine if one location is east of another, we primarily compare their longitudes (east-west lines). In the Western Hemisphere, lower longitude values (e.g., 119° W) indicate positions further east compared to higher values (e.g., 120° W). For example, 119.07° W is east of 119.65° W.
   - Note that latitudes (north-south) differ here (39.31° N vs. 36.85° N), so we're not directly on the same parallel, but longitude is the key factor for east-west comparison.

3. **Compare the longitudes:**
   - St. Mary’s in the Mountains: 119.65° W.
   - Pine Flat Dam: 119.07° W.
   - Since 119.65° W is a higher number than 119.07° W, Virginia City (and thus the church) is further west than Pine Flat Dam.

4. **Consider broader geographical context:**
   - Nevada is generally east of California, but the specific locations matter. Virginia City is in western Nevada, near the California border and east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Pine Flat Dam is in eastern California, within the Sierra Nevada.
   - However, based on the longitude comparison, Virginia City is actually west of Pine Flat Dam, not east. This might seem counterintuitive at first, but it's due to the precise positioning: Pine Flat Dam is further east in California than Virginia City is in Nevada.

5. **Conclusion from analysis:**
   - Since the longitude of St. Mary’s in the Mountains (119.65° W) is west of Pine Flat Dam's longitude (119.07° W), the church is not located east of the dam.

### Final Answer:
No
