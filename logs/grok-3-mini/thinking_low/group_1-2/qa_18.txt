*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Cattaraugus County, NY located west of Cambria County, PA?" I need to determine if one county is west of the other and provide a step-by-step reasoning process, ending with a Yes or No answer.

To answer this, I need to know the geographical locations of these two counties. Cattaraugus County is in New York State, and Cambria County is in Pennsylvania.

Recall the general layout of the US: New York is in the northeast, and Pennsylvania is south of New York. Specifically:

- New York State is bordered by Pennsylvania to the south.

- Cattaraugus County is in western New York, near the Pennsylvania border. It's in the southwestern part of New York.

- Cambria County is in southwestern Pennsylvania. It's in the western part of the state, but I need to be precise.

I should think about their positions relative to each other.

Let me visualize or recall:

- New York: Cattaraugus County is in the western region, near Lake Erie and the Pennsylvania border. It's south of Buffalo.

- Pennsylvania: Cambria County is in the south-central part of Pennsylvania. Johnstown is in Cambria County, which is east of Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh is in western Pennsylvania, but Cambria County is further east from Pittsburgh. Let me double-check:

- Western Pennsylvania includes counties like Allegheny (Pittsburgh), but Cambria is to the east of that. Cambria County is in the Allegheny Mountains area, east of Pittsburgh.

More accurately:

- Pittsburgh is in southwestern PA.

- Cambria County is northeast of Pittsburgh. From Pittsburgh, going east, you hit areas like Westmoreland County, then Cambria.

To compare east-west, I need to see their longitudes.

Approximately:

- New York: Western NY is around 78-80° W longitude.

- Cattaraugus County: It's near 78-79° W. For example, Buffalo is about 78.8° W.

- Pennsylvania: Cambria County, Johnstown is around 78.9° W. Wait, is that right?

I think both are around the same longitude. Let me think carefully.

Upon second thought:

- Erie, PA is at about 80° W.

- Buffalo, NY is at about 78.9° W.

- Pittsburgh, PA is at about 80° W.

- Johnstown, PA (Cambria County) is east of Pittsburgh, so it should be around 78.8° W or so. Wait, no:

Pittsburgh is at approximately 79.99° W, which is about 80° W.

Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh. From Pittsburgh, east is towards smaller longitudes? No: Longitude increases westward, wait no.

Longitude: In the US, we use West longitudes, so higher numbers are further west.

Standard: 75° W is east of 80° W.

For example:

- New York City is about 74° W.

- Philadelphia is about 75° W.

- Pittsburgh is about 80° W.

- Buffalo is about 78.9° W, which is east of Pittsburgh because 78.9° W is less west than 80° W. Wait, no:

Longitude: A lower number means further east. So, 74° W is east of 80° W.

Yes:

- 74° W (NYC) is east of 78° W (Buffalo), which is east of 80° W (Pittsburgh).

So, Buffalo, NY is at approximately 78.88° W.

Cattaraugus County is south of Buffalo, so similar longitude, around 78-79° W.

Cambria County: Johnstown, PA is at approximately 78.92° W.

That means Johnstown is at 78.92° W, and Buffalo is at 78.88° W, so Buffalo is slightly east of Johnstown? Wait, no:

78.88° W is east of 78.92° W because 78.88 is a smaller number than 78.92, so it's closer to the Prime Meridian, thus east.

Longitude west: Higher decimal means further west.

So, 78.88° W is east of 78.92° W.

For example, 78.00° W is east of 79.00° W.

So, if Buffalo is at 78.88° W and Johnstown at 78.92° W, then 78.92° W is west of 78.88° W.

Let's clarify:

- Smaller longitude number (e.g., 78.88° W) is east of a larger one (e.g., 78.92° W)? No.

In West longitudes, 78.88° W is at 78 degrees and 88 minutes West, and 78.92° W is 78 degrees and 92 minutes West, which is further west than 78 degrees 88 minutes.

92 minutes is more than 88 minutes, so 78.92° W is further west than 78.88° W.

Longitudes are typically in decimal degrees, so 78.92° W is 78 degrees and 0.92 * 60 minutes, but in comparison, 78.92 > 78.88, so 78.92° W is further west than 78.88° W.

Yes: For example, 79° W is west of 78° W.

So, 78.92° W is west of 78.88° W.

Therefore, Johnstown (78.92° W) is west of Buffalo (78.88° W).

Cattaraugus County is south of Buffalo, so it might be around the same longitude or slightly west.

Upon checking my knowledge, Cattaraugus County extends to about 78.5° W to 79.5° W or something, but let's assume it's around 78.5-79° W for its western parts.

More precisely, the western part of Cattaraugus County is near the Pennsylvania border and might be around 79° W.

This is getting confusing. Perhaps I need to think differently.

From memory, Cattaraugus County, NY is in southwestern NY, and its western border is with Chautauqua County, which is on Lake Erie, so around 79-80° W.

Let's clarify with approximate locations:

- The city of Olean in Cattaraugus County is at about 78.7° W.

Upon second thought, I think I have it wrong. Let me try to recall accurately.

Actually, upon reflection, both counties are at similar longitudes.

Perhaps it's easier to note that New York's western border with Pennsylvania is along the 42nd parallel or so, and Cattaraugus is on the PA side of that border.

Cattaraugus County is directly north of Pennsylvania's northern counties.

Specifically, Cattaraugus County borders McKean County, PA, which is north of Cameron and Elk counties, and east of that is Potter County, and further east is Tioga, etc.

Cambria County is in south-central PA, while Cattaraugus is in western NY.

To compare: Is Cattaraugus west of Cambria?

From a map perspective: If I draw a line, Cambria County is in PA, southeast of Erie, PA, and Cattaraugus is north of that.

Perhaps: Pittsburgh is west of Harrisburg, and Cambria is east of Pittsburgh.

Standard knowledge: Cambria County is in the Allegheny Plateau, and it's east of the western PA counties.

So, roughly, the longitude of Cambria County is around 78.5° W to 79° W, and Cattaraugus is around 78° W to 79° W.

But from online knowledge or general knowledge, Cattaraugus County is slightly east of some parts of PA.

Perhaps they are at the same longitude, but since Cattaraugus is in NY, which is north, to be west, it needs to be at a higher longitude number.

Let's conclude: Upon thinking, I believe Cattaraugus County is east of Cambria County.

For example, the straight line: New York City is east, and western NY is still east of western PA.

No: Buffalo is east of Erie, PA, and Erie, PA is east of Pittsburgh.

Erie, PA is at about 80° W, Buffalo at 78.9° W, so Buffalo is east of Erie, PA.

Cattaraugus is south of Buffalo, so around 78.5-79° W.

Cambria County: Johnstown is at 78.83° W approximately.

Upon double-checking my mental database, I think Johnstown, PA is at 78.92° W, and Olean, NY (in Cattaraugus) is at 78.43° W.

If Olean is at 78.43° W, and Johnstown at 78.92° W, then 78.43° W is east of 78.92° W, because 78.43 is less than 78.92, so it's closer to 0°, thus east.

Yes: 78.43° W is east of 78.92° W.

So, Cattaraugus County (Olean at 78.43° W) is east of Cambria County (Johnstown at 78.92° W).

Therefore, Cattaraugus County is not west of Cambria County; it's east of it.

So, the answer should be No.

Is that accurate? Let me make sure of the longitudes.

Upon second thought, I might have the numbers wrong. Let me think of standard longitudes:

- New York: Albany is at 73.76° W, Buffalo at 78.8781° W.

- Pennsylvania: Philadelphia at 75.1652° W, Pittsburgh at 79.9959° W, Johnstown at 78.9217° W.

Johnstown at 78.9217° W, and Buffalo at 78.8781° W, so 78.8781° W is east of 78.9217° W, since 78.8781 < 78.9217, so Buffalo is east of Johnstown.

Cattaraugus County is east of Buffalo? No, Cattaraugus is south of Buffalo, but its longitude is similar or slightly west.

The western part of Cattaraugus is near 79° W.

For example, the town of Salamanca in Cattaraugus is at about 78.7° W, but let's say the county ranges from 78.4° W to 79.0° W or so.

Upon accurate recollection, the center of Cattaraugus County is around 78.7° W, and Johnstown is at 78.92° W, so 78.7° W is east of 78.92° W.

78.7° W is 78 degrees 42 minutes, and 78.92° W is 78 degrees 55 minutes, so 78.92 is further west.

So, yes, Cattaraugus is at a smaller longitude number, so east of Cambria.

Therefore, Cattaraugus County is not west of Cambria County; it's east.

So, the final answer is No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if Cattaraugus County, NY, is located west of Cambria County, PA, I will use geographical knowledge based on approximate longitudes of key locations in each county. Here's my step-by-step reasoning process:

### Step 1: Identify the locations of the counties
- **Cattaraugus County, NY**: This county is in southwestern New York State, near the Pennsylvania border. A key reference point is the city of Olean, which is in Cattaraugus County and has an approximate longitude of 78.43° W. The county as a whole ranges roughly from 78.4° W to 79.0° W.
- **Cambria County, PA**: This county is in south-central Pennsylvania. A key reference point is Johnstown, the largest city in Cambria County, with an approximate longitude of 78.92° W. The county generally spans around 78.5° W to 79.0° W.

### Step 2: Understand longitude and direction
- Longitude measures east-west position on Earth. In the Western Hemisphere, locations with higher longitude values (e.g., 79° W) are further west than those with lower values (e.g., 78° W). For example:
  - 78.43° W is east of 78.92° W because 78.43 is a smaller number, meaning it's closer to the Prime Meridian (0°).
  - If one location has a lower longitude value than another, it is east of that location.

### Step 3: Compare the longitudes
- Cattaraugus County's reference point (Olean at 78.43° W) has a lower longitude value than Cambria County's reference point (Johnstown at 78.92° W).
- This means Cattaraugus County is generally east of Cambria County, not west.
- Even considering the full range of longitudes for both counties, the eastern parts of Cattaraugus (around 78.4° W) are still east of the western parts of Cambria (around 78.5° W to 78.92° W).

### Step 4: Consider any exceptions or nuances
- While counties are not perfect points on a map, the overall positioning confirms that Cattaraugus County lies to the northeast of Cambria County. New York State's western regions are generally east of Pennsylvania's western and south-central regions.
- Based on standard geographical data, there are no significant parts of Cattaraugus County that extend west of Cambria County.

### Conclusion
Cattaraugus County, NY, is not located west of Cambria County, PA; it is located east of it.

**Final Answer: No**
