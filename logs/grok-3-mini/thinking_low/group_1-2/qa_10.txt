*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Was Dream Theater’s Pull Me Under released earlier than Beastie Boys’s Jimmy James? Show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

I need to compare the release dates of two songs:

1. Dream Theater’s "Pull Me Under"

2. Beastie Boys’s "Jimmy James"

I should recall or look up the release dates. As an AI, I have access to general knowledge up to my last training data. Let's assume I know the following based on common knowledge:

- "Pull Me Under" by Dream Theater is from their album "Images and Words," which was released in 1992.

- Specifically, "Pull Me Under" was released as a single in 1992.

- "Jimmy James" by Beastie Boys is from their album "Check Your Head," which was released in 1992.

Both are from 1992? I need to be more precise.

Let me double-check:

- Dream Theater's album "Images and Words" was released on July 7, 1992. "Pull Me Under" is the lead single from that album, so it was likely released around the same time or slightly before.

- Beastie Boys' "Check Your Head" was released on April 21, 1992. "Jimmy James" is a track from that album, and it might have been released as a single later.

For singles, the release date might differ from the album date.

Upon more accurate recollection:

- "Pull Me Under" by Dream Theater was released as a single in September 1992.

I need to be precise. Let me think:

Actually, standard knowledge:

- "Images and Words" by Dream Theater was released on July 7, 1992, and "Pull Me Under" was the first single, promoted around that time.

- For Beastie Boys, "Check Your Head" was released on April 21, 1992, and "Jimmy James" was released as a single on July 14, 1992.

Is that correct? Let me verify my internal knowledge.

Upon second thought:

- "Jimmy James" was indeed released as a single from "Check Your Head." The single for "Jimmy James" was released in 1992, but I need the exact date.

From what I recall:

- Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James" single was released in July 1992.

More specifically, I believe the album "Check Your Head" came out in April 1992, and singles were released subsequently.

Let me clarify:

After a quick mental search:

- "So What'cha Want" was a single from "Check Your Head" released in June 1992.

- "Jimmy James" was released as a single later in 1992, possibly August or September.

This is getting fuzzy. I need to be accurate.

Standard sources:

- Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under" single was released in 1992, but let's say it's from the album in July 1992.

Perhaps I should use approximate dates.

Upon better recollection:

- "Images and Words" by Dream Theater: July 7, 1992

- "Pull Me Under" as a single: It was released to promote the album, so around July 1992.

- "Check Your Head" by Beastie Boys: April 21, 1992

- "Jimmy James" as a single: I believe it was released on July 13, 1992, in the UK, or something like that. Wait, no.

Actually, upon thinking, "Jimmy James" was not the first single. The first single from "Check Your Head" was "Pass the Mic" or "So What'cha Want."

This is confusing. Let me think differently.

From reliable memory:

- Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James" was released as a single in August 1992.

I need to confirm.

Upon standard knowledge, "Jimmy James" single was released in 1992, but let's assume it's after the album.

To be precise, if the album was in April, and singles follow, it's likely "Jimmy James" was released later in the year.

I found a conflict in my knowledge. Let me straighten this out.

After thinking, I recall that "Pass the Mic" was the first single in April 1992, "So What'cha Want" in June 1992, and "Jimmy James" in August 1992.

Yes, that's it.

So, "Jimmy James" single by Beastie Boys was released on August 10, 1992, in the US or something like that.

For Dream Theater, "Pull Me Under" was released as a single in September 1992 in some markets, but the album was in July.

This is tricky. Let's clarify.

Upon double-checking my knowledge:

- Dream Theater's "Images and Words" was released on July 7, 1992 in the US.

- "Pull Me Under" was the lead single, and it was released prior to the album to promote it, but in the US, it might have been around the same time.

Actually, upon accurate recollection, "Pull Me Under" was released as a single in 1992, but the exact date is not always specified. However, it's generally considered part of the 1992 release with the album.

For comparison, if "Jimmy James" single was in August 1992, and "Pull Me Under" was in July or earlier, then "Pull Me Under" was earlier.

Let's get the exact dates.

From my knowledge:

- Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James" single was released on July 14, 1992, in the UK, and perhaps later in the US.

This is getting complicated with regions.

Perhaps it's simpler to compare the album release dates, but the question is about the songs, which could mean the single releases.

The question says "released," which typically means the single release if it's a single, or the album if that's how it's known.

To be precise, let's assume:

- "Pull Me Under" was released as a single in September 1992.

I think I have it wrong.

Upon correct recollection:

- Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under" was released as a single in the US in 1992, but the exact date is not widely known, but the album was July 7, 1992.

- For Beastie Boys, "Jimmy James" was released as a single on August 3, 1992, in the US.

After thinking, I believe "Jimmy James" single was released in 1992, but let's say it's after July.

To make a decision, from standard sources:

Upon final thought, "Pull Me Under" from Dream Theater was released in 1992, and it's from the album in July, so the song was available in July 1992.

"Jimmy James" is from an album in April 1992, so the song was available in April 1992.

The question is about the songs' release, which for album tracks, is the album release date.

The question specifies "Dream Theater’s Pull Me Under" and "Beastie Boys’s Jimmy James," which are songs, so likely the date they were first released, which is the album date.

So, "Check Your Head" was released on April 21, 1992, so "Jimmy James" was released on that date.

"Images and Words" on July 7, 1992, so "Pull Me Under" on that date.

Therefore, "Jimmy James" was released earlier than "Pull Me Under."

Is that accurate? For songs on albums, the release date is the album's release date.

So, April 21, 1992 for "Jimmy James," and July 7, 1992 for "Pull Me Under."

Thus, "Pull Me Under" was released later.

The question is: "Was Dream Theater’s Pull Me Under released earlier than Beastie Boys’s Jimmy James?"

If "Pull Me Under" is July 7, 1992, and "Jimmy James" is April 21, 1992, then no, "Pull Me Under" was not released earlier; it was later.

So, the answer should be No.

I thought about singles. Did "Pull Me Under" have a single release before the album? I don't think so; it was released with the album.

For "Jimmy James," it was on the album first.

So, yes, "Jimmy James" was released first.

Final reasoning:

1. Determine the release date of "Pull Me Under" by Dream Theater: From the album "Images and Words," released on July 7, 1992.

2. Determine the release date of "Jimmy James" by Beastie Boys: From the album "Check Your Head," released on April 21, 1992.

3. Compare the dates: April 21, 1992 is earlier than July 7, 1992.

4. Therefore, "Pull Me Under" was not released earlier than "Jimmy James"; it was released later.

So, the final answer is No.
