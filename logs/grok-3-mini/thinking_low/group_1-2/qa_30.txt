*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Lake Vico located west of Pragser Wildsee?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to know where these lakes are located. I'm not immediately familiar with them, so I'll recall or think about their geographical positions.

- Lake Vico: I believe this is in Italy. Specifically, it's in the Lazio region, near Rome. Lake Vico is a volcanic lake in the Cimini Mountains.

- Pragser Wildsee: This sounds like it's in the Alps. I think it's in Italy as well, in the South Tyrol region. Pragser Wildsee is also known as Lake Braies, which is in the Dolomites, northern Italy.

Both are in Italy, but in different parts. Lake Vico is in central Italy, while Pragser Wildsee is in the north.

To determine if Lake Vico is west of Pragser Wildsee, I need to compare their east-west positions.

Let me visualize a map of Italy:

- Northern Italy: Pragser Wildsee is in the Dolomites, which are in the northeast part of Italy, near the Austrian border.

- Central Italy: Lake Vico is near Viterbo, which is northwest of Rome, so roughly in the west-central part.

More precisely:

- Pragser Wildsee (Lake Braies) is located at approximately 46.7° N latitude and 12.1° E longitude.

- Lake Vico is at about 42.4° N latitude and 12.1° E longitude. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Actually, upon second thought:

- Lake Vico is in the province of Viterbo, which is around 42.42° N and 12.07° E.

- Pragser Wildsee is in South Tyrol, around 46.69° N and 12.08° E.

Both have similar longitudes? Let me confirm that.

From my knowledge:

- Rome is at about 12.5° E.

- Viterbo, near Lake Vico, is slightly west of Rome, so around 12.0° E.

- South Tyrol: Bolzano is at about 11.3° E, and Pragser Wildsee is further east, I think around 12.0° E or so. Wait, no.

Let me correct that. Upon thinking, Pragser Wildsee is near the town of Braies, which is at approximately 46.7° N and 12.0° E.

Actually, looking it up in my mental map:

- Pragser Wildsee: 46.6917° N, 12.0728° E

- Lake Vico: 42.4150° N, 12.0722° E

They have almost the same longitude! Both are around 12.07° E.

If they have the same longitude, that means they are on the same meridian, so one is directly north or south of the other, not east or west.

Lake Vico is at 42.4° N, and Pragser Wildsee is at 46.7° N, so Pragser Wildsee is north of Lake Vico.

The question is about west: "Is Lake Vico located west of Pragser Wildsee?"

If they have the same longitude, Lake Vico is not west of Pragser Wildsee; it's directly south.

To be precise: If two points have the same longitude, the one with the lower latitude is south of the other.

So, Lake Vico (south) is not west of Pragser Wildsee (north).

Therefore, the answer should be No.

Is their longitude exactly the same? Let me make sure.

Upon double-checking my knowledge:

- Lake Vico: Approximately 42.42° N, 12.08° E

- Pragser Wildsee: 46.69° N, 12.08° E

Yes, very close. In fact, they are almost on the same line of longitude.

So, Lake Vico is south of Pragser Wildsee, not west.

If anything, Pragser Wildsee is north of Lake Vico.

The question specifically asks if Lake Vico is west of Pragser Wildsee, which it is not.

To confirm: West means having a lower longitude value.

Longitude increases eastward. So, if Lake Vico has a longitude less than Pragser Wildsee, it would be west.

But from what I have, both are around 12.08° E, so same longitude.

Therefore, it's not west; it's south.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations of the lakes:**
   - Lake Vico is located in central Italy, specifically in the Lazio region near the town of Caprarola, in the Cimini Mountains. Its approximate coordinates are 42.42° N latitude and 12.08° E longitude.
   - Pragser Wildsee (also known as Lake Braies) is located in northern Italy, in the South Tyrol region of the Dolomites. Its approximate coordinates are 46.69° N latitude and 12.08° E longitude.

2. **Compare the longitudes:**
   - Longitude determines east-west position. Lake Vico is at approximately 12.08° E, and Pragser Wildsee is also at approximately 12.08° E.
   - Since both lakes have nearly identical longitudes, they are aligned along the same meridian (a line of longitude). This means one is directly north or south of the other, not east or west.

3. **Determine the relative direction:**
   - Lake Vico is at 42.42° N, while Pragser Wildsee is at 46.69° N. The higher latitude of Pragser Wildsee indicates it is north of Lake Vico.
   - Therefore, Lake Vico is south of Pragser Wildsee, not west.

4. **Answer the specific question:**
   - The question asks if Lake Vico is located west of Pragser Wildsee. Based on the longitude comparison, Lake Vico is not west; it is directly south.

### Final Answer:
No
