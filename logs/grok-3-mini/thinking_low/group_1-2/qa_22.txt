*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Dal-Tex Building, TX located south of Lake Martin, AL?" I need to determine if this is true and provide step-by-step reasoning.

Key elements:
- Dal-Tex Building, TX: This seems like a location in Texas. I'm not immediately familiar with it, but it might be a building or a place in Texas.
- Lake Martin, AL: This is a lake in Alabama.

I need to compare their geographical positions: Is the Dal-Tex Building in Texas south of Lake Martin in Alabama?

Step 1: Verify the locations.
   - Lake Martin is a reservoir in Alabama, near Alexander City, in the eastern part of the state.
   - Dal-Tex Building: This might be a reference to the Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, Texas. I recall that in the context of the JFK assassination, there's a Dal-Tex Building in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, TX. So, I'll assume it's in Dallas, Texas.

Step 2: Determine the geographical coordinates or general positions.
   - Texas is a large state in the southern United States.
   - Dallas, TX, is in north-central Texas, roughly at about 32.7767° N latitude.
   - Alabama is in the southeastern United States.
   - Lake Martin, AL, is in east-central Alabama, around 32.9° N latitude (Alexander City is approximately at 32.944° N).

I need to compare latitudes because "south of" typically means lower latitude in the Northern Hemisphere.

- Dallas, TX: Approximately 32.78° N
- Lake Martin, AL: Alexander City, AL, is about 32.94° N

Dallas is at 32.78° N, and Alexander City is at 32.94° N. That means Alexander City is slightly north of Dallas.

Latitude increases as you go north, so 32.94° N is north of 32.78° N.

Therefore, Dallas, TX (32.78° N) is south of Alexander City, AL (32.94° N).

The question is: Is Dal-Tex Building, TX (in Dallas) located south of Lake Martin, AL?

If Dallas is at a lower latitude than Lake Martin, then yes, it's south of it.

Longitude might matter for exact positioning, but for a general "south of," we primarily look at latitude.

- Dallas, TX: Longitude about 96.80° W
- Alexander City, AL: Longitude about 85.93° W

Dallas is further west than Alabama. So, to be precisely south, we need to consider if a point directly south of Lake Martin would reach Dallas.

However, for broad terms, if one place has a lower latitude, it's generally south, regardless of longitude.

Since Dallas is at 32.78° N and Lake Martin at 32.94° N, Dallas is south of Lake Martin.

32.78° N is south of 32.94° N, yes.

So, step-by-step:

1. Identify locations:
   - Dal-Tex Building: Assumed in Dallas, TX (32.78° N, 96.80° W)
   - Lake Martin: In Alexander City, AL (32.94° N, 85.93° W)

2. Compare latitudes:
   - Latitude of Dal-Tex Building: ~32.78° N
   - Latitude of Lake Martin: ~32.94° N
   - Since 32.78° N < 32.94° N, Dal-Tex Building is at a lower latitude, meaning it's south.

3. Consider the overall geography:
   - Texas and Alabama are both in the south, but Dallas is slightly south of central Alabama.

Therefore, yes, Dal-Tex Building in TX is located south of Lake Martin in AL.

Final answer should be Yes or No. Based on this, it's Yes.

Below is my step-by-step reasoning process to answer the query: "Is Dal-Tex Building, TX located south of Lake Martin, AL?"

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations:**
   - Dal-Tex Building, TX: This likely refers to the Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, Texas. It is a historic building located in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, at approximately 32.78° N latitude and 96.80° W longitude.
   - Lake Martin, AL: This is a reservoir in east-central Alabama, near Alexander City. Its approximate location is around 32.94° N latitude and 85.93° W longitude.

2. **Understand the concept of "south of":**
   - In geography, determining if one location is south of another primarily involves comparing their latitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere, a lower latitude value indicates a more southern position. Longitude can provide additional context for precise directions, but for a general "south of" query, latitude is the key factor.

3. **Compare the latitudes:**
   - Dal-Tex Building (Dallas, TX): Approximately 32.78° N.
   - Lake Martin (Alexander City, AL): Approximately 32.94° N.
   - Since 32.78° N is less than 32.94° N, Dallas, TX, is at a lower latitude than Lake Martin, AL. This means Dallas is south of Lake Martin.

4. **Consider longitude and overall geography:**
   - Longitude of Dal-Tex Building: 96.80° W (further west).
   - Longitude of Lake Martin: 85.93° W (further east).
   - While Dallas is west of Lake Martin, the latitude comparison still holds for determining a general south-north relationship. A line drawn directly south from Lake Martin would pass through areas south of its latitude, including Dallas.

5. **Account for any potential ambiguities:**
   - The Dal-Tex Building is specifically tied to Dallas, TX, based on historical and geographical references. If this were a different "Dal-Tex Building" in another part of Texas, it could alter the result, but no such alternative is commonly known.
   - Based on standard geographical data, the conclusion remains consistent.

### Final Answer:
Yes
