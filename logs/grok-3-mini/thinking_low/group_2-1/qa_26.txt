*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Was the discovery of penicillin before the discovery of DNA structure?" I need to answer with a yes or no, and show my step-by-step reasoning.

Key events:

- Discovery of penicillin: This was by Alexander Fleming in 1928. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum inhibited bacterial growth.

- Discovery of DNA structure: This refers to the double helix structure of DNA, discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953.

Now, compare the dates:

- Penicillin: 1928

- DNA structure: 1953

1928 is before 1953, so yes, the discovery of penicillin was before the discovery of DNA structure.

Is there any ambiguity? What exactly is meant by "discovery of DNA structure"? DNA was discovered earlier by Friedrich Miescher in 1869, but the question likely means the double helix model, as that's the landmark discovery.

The question specifies "DNA structure," which typically refers to Watson and Crick's work.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall the key dates:

   - Penicillin: Discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming.

   - DNA structure: The double helix was proposed in 1953 by Watson and Crick.

2. Compare the years: 1928 vs. 1953.

3. Determine the order: 1928 comes before 1953.

4. Therefore, the discovery of penicillin was before the discovery of DNA structure.

Final answer: Yes.

I should ensure there are no tricks. Was penicillin's discovery later? No, Fleming's work was in 1928, and it was widely recognized then, even if mass production came later.

For DNA, while Rosalind Franklin and others contributed, the structure was published in 1953.

So, straightforward.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the key events and their dates:**
   - The discovery of penicillin is attributed to Alexander Fleming, who observed its antibacterial properties in 1928. This is when the mold Penicillium notatum was found to inhibit bacterial growth, marking the initial discovery.
   
   - The discovery of DNA structure refers to the double helix model of DNA, which was proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. This is based on their work, along with contributions from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, and is the landmark event for understanding DNA's structure.

2. **Compare the dates:**
   - Penicillin: 1928
   - DNA structure: 1953
   
   Since 1928 is earlier than 1953, the discovery of penicillin occurred first.

3. **Consider potential ambiguities:**
   - DNA was first isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869, but the question specifically asks about the "discovery of DNA structure," which commonly refers to the double helix model from 1953, not the initial isolation.
   - Penicillin's discovery in 1928 is well-established as the starting point, even though its widespread use and development came later (e.g., during World War II).

4. **Draw a conclusion:**
   - Based on the timeline, the discovery of penicillin predates the discovery of DNA structure.

### Final Answer:
Yes
