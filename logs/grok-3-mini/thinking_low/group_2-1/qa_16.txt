*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the boiling point of water higher than the freezing point of water?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer as Yes or No.

Step 1: Recall what the boiling point and freezing point of water are.

- The boiling point of water is the temperature at which water turns from a liquid to a gas. For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), this is 100 degrees Celsius.

- The freezing point of water is the temperature at which water turns from a liquid to a solid. For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, this is 0 degrees Celsius.

Step 2: Compare the two temperatures.

- Boiling point: 100°C

- Freezing point: 0°C

- Is 100°C higher than 0°C? Yes, it is.

Step 3: Consider if there are any conditions or exceptions.

- The question doesn't specify any pressure or impurities, so I'll assume standard conditions. Under standard conditions, water boils at 100°C and freezes at 0°C.

- In general, for most substances, the boiling point is higher than the freezing point because boiling requires more energy to overcome intermolecular forces completely, while freezing is just the point where the liquid starts to solidify.

Step 4: Ensure the reasoning is straightforward.

- Step-by-step process:

  1. Identify the boiling point of water: 100°C at 1 atm.

  2. Identify the freezing point of water: 0°C at 1 atm.

  3. Compare: 100°C > 0°C.

  4. Therefore, yes, the boiling point is higher.

Step 5: Final answer should be just "Yes" or "No", as per the instructions.

So, my final answer is Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Define the boiling point of water**: The boiling point is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a gas. Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), this is 100°C (212°F).

2. **Define the freezing point of water**: The freezing point is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a solid. Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), this is 0°C (32°F).

3. **Compare the two temperatures**: The boiling point of water (100°C) is greater than the freezing point of water (0°C).

4. **Consider standard conditions**: The question does not specify any unusual conditions like high pressure or impurities, so we assume standard conditions where these values apply.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, the boiling point is indeed higher than the freezing point.

### Final Answer:  
Yes
