*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the melting point of ice lower than the boiling point of water?"

I need to recall what these terms mean. Ice is the solid form of water, so the melting point of ice is the temperature at which ice turns into liquid water. For water, that's 0 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.

The boiling point of water is the temperature at which liquid water turns into vapor, which is 100 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure.

So, melting point of ice: 0°C

Boiling point of water: 100°C

Is 0°C lower than 100°C? Yes, obviously.

I should ensure there are no tricks. Is this under standard conditions? The question doesn't specify, but typically, we assume standard pressure unless stated otherwise.

Ice and water are both H2O, so we're talking about the same substance in different states.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the melting point of ice: It's the temperature where solid water (ice) becomes liquid water. At 1 atm pressure, this is 0°C.

2. Identify the boiling point of water: It's the temperature where liquid water becomes gas (steam). At 1 atm pressure, this is 100°C.

3. Compare the two temperatures: 0°C and 100°C.

4. Determine if 0°C is lower than 100°C: Yes, because 0 is less than 100.

5. Therefore, the melting point of ice is lower than the boiling point of water.

Final answer should be "Yes" as per the instructions.

The question says: "Show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

So, I'll structure my response accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Define the terms**:  
   - The melting point of ice is the temperature at which solid ice (H₂O) changes to liquid water. Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), this occurs at 0°C.  
   - The boiling point of water is the temperature at which liquid water (H₂O) changes to water vapor (gas). Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), this occurs at 100°C.

2. **Compare the values**:  
   - Melting point of ice: 0°C.  
   - Boiling point of water: 100°C.  
   - To determine if one is lower than the other, compare the numerical values: 0°C is less than 100°C.

3. **Consider conditions**:  
   - These values are based on standard conditions (1 atm pressure). The question does not specify otherwise, so we assume standard conditions apply. Under these conditions, the comparison holds true.

4. **Draw a conclusion**:  
   - Since 0°C is lower than 100°C, the melting point of ice is indeed lower than the boiling point of water.

### Final Answer:  
Yes
