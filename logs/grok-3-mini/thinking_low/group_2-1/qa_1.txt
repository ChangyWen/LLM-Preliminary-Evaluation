*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is a blue whale heavier than an elephant?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Step 1: Understand the question. It's comparing the weight of a blue whale and an elephant. I need to recall or know the approximate weights of these animals.

Step 2: Recall facts about blue whales. Blue whales are the largest animals on Earth. An adult blue whale can weigh up to 200 tons. More precisely, I think it's around 100 to 150 tons for a full-grown one, but let's confirm my knowledge: The heaviest blue whale ever recorded was about 190 tons, but typically, they weigh between 50 to 150 tons.

Step 3: Recall facts about elephants. Elephants are the largest land animals. An adult African elephant, the largest type, can weigh up to about 6 to 7 tons. More accurately, male African elephants can weigh up to 6,000 to 7,000 kilograms, which is 6 to 7 metric tons.

Step 4: Convert units for comparison. Weights are often in tons or kilograms. 1 ton is 1,000 kilograms, but I need to be consistent.

- Blue whale: Up to 150,000 kg (150 tons).

- Elephant: Up to 7,000 kg (7 tons).

Clearly, 150,000 kg is much greater than 7,000 kg.

Step 5: Make the comparison. Is 150 tons greater than 7 tons? Yes, obviously.

Step 6: Consider if there's any trick. Is there a possibility that a small blue whale is lighter than a large elephant? The question says "a blue whale" and "an elephant," which typically implies a typical adult of each. Even the smallest adult blue whales are much heavier than the largest elephants.

For example, a newborn blue whale can weigh around 2-3 tons, which is still comparable to an adult elephant, but the question likely means an adult blue whale.

To be thorough:

- Smallest adult blue whale: Probably around 50 tons.

- Largest elephant: About 7 tons.

So, still, yes.

Step 7: Structure the response. The user asked for step-by-step reasoning and a final answer (Yes or No).

My response should include:

- Step-by-step explanation.

- End with "Yes" or "No".

Final Answer: Yes, because a blue whale is heavier than an elephant.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the animals and their general sizes**: We're comparing a blue whale (the largest animal on Earth) and an elephant (the largest land animal). To answer this, I need to compare their typical weights.

2. **Recall the weight of a blue whale**: Adult blue whales are massive. A full-grown blue whale can weigh between 50 to 150 metric tons (1 metric ton = 1,000 kg). For example, the average adult blue whale weighs about 100 tons, and some can reach up to 190 tons.

3. **Recall the weight of an elephant**: Elephants vary by species, but the largest is the African elephant. An adult male African elephant typically weighs between 4 to 7 metric tons, with the heaviest recorded at around 7 tons.

4. **Make a direct comparison**: 
   - Blue whale: Minimum adult weight is about 50 tons.
   - Elephant: Maximum weight is about 7 tons.
   - Clearly, 50 tons (or more) is greater than 7 tons. Even if we consider the smallest adult blue whale (around 50 tons), it is still much heavier than the largest elephant.

5. **Consider edge cases**: The question doesn't specify "adult" or "young," but it implies typical representatives. A newborn blue whale might weigh 2-3 tons, which could be lighter than a large adult elephant (up to 7 tons). However, based on standard comparisons, "a blue whale" generally refers to an adult, which is always heavier.

6. **Conclude the comparison**: Based on the weights, a blue whale is consistently heavier than an elephant in most, if not all, practical scenarios.

### Final Answer: Yes
