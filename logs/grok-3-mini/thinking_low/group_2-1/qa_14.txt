*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Does a blue whale have a larger heart than an elephant?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Key elements: Compare the heart size of a blue whale and an elephant. Larger likely means in terms of physical size, like volume or weight.

Step 1: Recall basic facts about these animals.
- Blue whale: It's the largest animal on Earth. It can grow up to 100 feet long and weigh up to 200 tons.
- Elephant: The largest land animal. African elephants can weigh up to 14 tons and be about 13 feet tall.

Step 2: Think about heart size in relation to body size.
- Heart size generally scales with body size. Larger animals have larger hearts to pump blood through their bodies.
- Since the blue whale is much larger than an elephant, its heart should be larger.

Step 3: Look for specific data if possible.
- From my knowledge: The blue whale has the largest heart of any animal. I think it's about the size of a small car, weighing around 400-600 pounds (180-270 kg).
- For an elephant: An African elephant's heart weighs about 30-40 pounds (13-18 kg).

Step 4: Verify the comparison.
- Blue whale heart: Approximately 400 pounds.
- Elephant heart: Approximately 30-40 pounds.
- Clearly, 400 pounds is much larger than 30-40 pounds.

Step 5: Consider if there's any trick or exception.
- Is there any context where an elephant's heart might be considered larger? For example, if we're talking about heart rate or efficiency, but the question is straightforward: "larger heart," which I interpret as physical size.
- No, the blue whale's heart is definitively larger.

Step 6: Structure the response.
- The user asked for step-by-step reasoning, so I need to outline my thought process clearly.
- End with a final answer: Yes or No.

Final Answer: Yes, because the blue whale is significantly larger, and its heart is proportionally and absolutely larger than that of an elephant.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The query asks whether the heart of a blue whale is larger than that of an elephant. "Larger" typically refers to physical size, such as weight or volume, rather than other metrics like heart rate or efficiency. I need to compare the two based on reliable biological knowledge.

2. **Recall Key Facts About the Animals**:
   - Blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, growing up to 100 feet (30 meters) long and weighing up to 200 tons (about 181 metric tonnes).
   - Elephants, specifically African elephants (the largest land species), can weigh up to 14 tons (about 12.7 metric tonnes) and stand about 13 feet (4 meters) tall.
   - Heart size generally correlates with body size, as larger animals need larger hearts to pump blood effectively through their bodies.

3. **Gather Specific Data on Heart Sizes**:
   - Based on scientific sources, the blue whale has the largest heart of any animal. Its heart can weigh approximately 400-600 pounds (180-270 kg) and is about the size of a small car.
   - For an elephant, the heart of an African elephant weighs around 30-40 pounds (13-18 kg).

4. **Make the Comparison**:
   - Blue whale heart weight: 400-600 pounds.
   - Elephant heart weight: 30-40 pounds.
   - The blue whale's heart is clearly much larger in absolute terms (e.g., 400 pounds vs. 30 pounds).

5. **Consider Any Exceptions or Nuances**:
   - Heart size might scale differently in some animals due to factors like metabolism or environment, but in this case, the blue whale's massive body size makes its heart proportionally and absolutely larger.
   - There's no evidence or scenario where an elephant's heart would be larger than a blue whale's.

6. **Conclude Based on Evidence**:
   - Given the significant difference in heart weights, the answer is straightforward.

### Final Answer: Yes
