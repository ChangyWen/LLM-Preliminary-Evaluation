*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the wavelength of red light longer than that of blue light?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer as "Yes" or "No".

Step 1: Recall what wavelength means in the context of light. Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave. For visible light, different colors correspond to different wavelengths.

Step 2: Remember the visible light spectrum. The visible spectrum ranges from about 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers. Red light is at the longer end, and blue light is at the shorter end.

Step 3: Specific values: Red light has wavelengths around 620-750 nm, while blue light has wavelengths around 450-495 nm. So, clearly, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

Step 4: Why is this the case? In the electromagnetic spectrum, as wavelength increases, frequency decreases, and vice versa. Red light has a lower frequency than blue light, which means it has a longer wavelength.

Step 5: Double-check for any exceptions. In standard physics, for visible light, red always has a longer wavelength than blue. There's no context where this might not hold true.

Step 6: Structure my response. The user asked for step-by-step reasoning, so I should outline it clearly, then end with the final answer.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Light is an electromagnetic wave, and its color is determined by its wavelength.

- The visible spectrum goes from violet (shortest wavelength) to red (longest wavelength).

- Blue light is towards the violet end, so it has a shorter wavelength.

- Red light is at the other end, so it has a longer wavelength.

- Therefore, yes, the wavelength of red light is longer than that of blue light.

Final answer: Yes.

Make sure the response is concise and directly addresses the query.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the concept of wavelength**: Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks of a wave. In the context of visible light, different colors correspond to different wavelengths, with the visible spectrum ranging from about 400 nm (nanometers) to 700 nm.

2. **Recall the visible light spectrum**: The colors of visible light are arranged in order of increasing wavelength: violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. This means violet and blue light have shorter wavelengths, while red light has a longer wavelength.

3. **Compare specific wavelengths**: 
   - Blue light typically has wavelengths in the range of 450–495 nm.
   - Red light typically has wavelengths in the range of 620–750 nm.
   - Comparing these ranges, red light's wavelengths (e.g., 620–750 nm) are clearly longer than blue light's wavelengths (e.g., 450–495 nm).

4. **Consider the physics principle**: In the electromagnetic spectrum, longer wavelengths correspond to lower frequencies and lower energy. Red light has a lower frequency than blue light, which aligns with it having a longer wavelength.

5. **Verify for exceptions**: In standard physics and optics, this relationship holds true for visible light under normal conditions. There are no exceptions in the context of typical red and blue light.

6. **Conclusion based on the above**: Since the wavelength of red light is in the range of 620–750 nm and blue light is in the range of 450–495 nm, red light indeed has a longer wavelength.

### Final Answer:
Yes
