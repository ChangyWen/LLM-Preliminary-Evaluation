*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon less than that on Earth?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer as "Yes" or "No".

Step 1: Recall what acceleration due to gravity means. It's the rate at which an object accelerates when falling freely under gravity. On Earth, it's approximately 9.8 m/s².

Step 2: Think about the Moon. The Moon has less mass than Earth, and gravity depends on the mass of the planet and the distance from its center.

Step 3: The formula for gravitational acceleration is from Newton's law of universal gravitation: g = G * M / R², where:
   - G is the gravitational constant,
   - M is the mass of the planet,
   - R is the radius of the planet.

Step 4: Compare Earth and Moon:
   - Earth's mass (M_earth) is about 5.97 × 10^24 kg.
   - Moon's mass (M_moon) is about 7.35 × 10^22 kg, which is much smaller than Earth's.
   - Earth's radius (R_earth) is about 6,371 km.
   - Moon's radius (R_moon) is about 1,737 km, which is smaller than Earth's.

Step 5: Plug into the formula:
   - For Earth: g_earth = G * M_earth / R_earth²
   - For Moon: g_moon = G * M_moon / R_moon²

   Since M_moon is much smaller than M_earth, but R_moon is also smaller than R_earth, I need to see which effect dominates.

Step 6: Calculate roughly:
   - The ratio g_moon / g_earth = (M_moon / M_earth) * (R_earth / R_moon)²

   M_moon / M_earth ≈ 7.35e22 / 5.97e24 = about 0.0123 (so about 1.23% of Earth's mass)

   R_earth / R_moon ≈ 6371 / 1737 ≈ 3.67

   So, (R_earth / R_moon)² ≈ (3.67)² ≈ 13.47

   Therefore, g_moon / g_earth ≈ 0.0123 * 13.47 ≈ 0.165

   So, g_moon ≈ 0.165 * g_earth ≈ 0.165 * 9.8 ≈ 1.62 m/s²

Step 7: The actual value for Moon's gravity is about 1.62 m/s², which is indeed less than Earth's 9.8 m/s².

Step 8: Conclusion: Yes, the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is less than that on Earth.

Final answer: Yes

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the concept of acceleration due to gravity**:  
   The acceleration due to gravity, denoted as \(g\), is the rate at which an object accelerates when falling freely under gravity. It depends on the mass of the celestial body and the distance from its center, as described by Newton's law of universal gravitation:  
   \[
   g = \frac{G \cdot M}{R^2}
   \]  
   where:  
   - \(G\) is the gravitational constant (\(6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}\)),  
   - \(M\) is the mass of the body (e.g., Earth or Moon),  
   - \(R\) is the radius of the body.

2. **Compare key values for Earth and the Moon**:  
   - Earth's mass (\(M_{\text{Earth}}\)) is approximately \(5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}\).  
   - Moon's mass (\(M_{\text{Moon}}\)) is approximately \(7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg}\), which is about 1.23% of Earth's mass.  
   - Earth's radius (\(R_{\text{Earth}}\)) is approximately \(6,371 \, \text{km}\).  
   - Moon's radius (\(R_{\text{Moon}}\)) is approximately \(1,737 \, \text{km}\), which is about 27% of Earth's radius.

3. **Calculate and compare \(g\) values**:  
   - For Earth, \(g_{\text{Earth}}\) is approximately \(9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\).  
   - For the Moon, we can estimate \(g_{\text{Moon}}\) using the ratio:  
     \[
     \frac{g_{\text{Moon}}}{g_{\text{Earth}}} = \frac{M_{\text{Moon}}}{M_{\text{Earth}}} \cdot \left(\frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{Moon}}}\right)^2
     \]  
     - \( \frac{M_{\text{Moon}}}{M_{\text{Earth}}} \approx 0.0123 \)  
     - \( \frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{Moon}}} \approx \frac{6371}{1737} \approx 3.67 \)  
     - \( \left(\frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{Moon}}}\right)^2 \approx (3.67)^2 \approx 13.47 \)  
     - Therefore, \( \frac{g_{\text{Moon}}}{g_{\text{Earth}}} \approx 0.0123 \times 13.47 \approx 0.165 \)  
     - So, \( g_{\text{Moon}} \approx 0.165 \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \approx 1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).  

   The actual measured value for the Moon's gravity is about \(1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2\).

4. **Make the comparison**:  
   - Earth's \(g\) is \(9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\).  
   - Moon's \(g\) is \(1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2\).  
   - Clearly, \(1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2 < 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\).

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The lower mass of the Moon compared to Earth has a greater effect on reducing gravity than the smaller radius has in increasing it, resulting in a lower acceleration due to gravity on the Moon.

### Final Answer:  
Yes
