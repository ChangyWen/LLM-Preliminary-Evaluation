*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is a peregrine falcon faster than an eagle?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Key elements:
- Compare the speed of a peregrine falcon and an eagle.
- I know that "eagle" is a general term; there are many species of eagles, like the bald eagle, golden eagle, etc. Their speeds vary.
- The peregrine falcon is a specific bird known for its speed.

From my knowledge:
- The peregrine falcon is the fastest bird in the world. It can reach speeds over 200 mph (320 km/h) during its hunting stoop (dive).
- Eagles are generally fast flyers, but not as fast as the peregrine falcon. For example:
  - The golden eagle can fly at around 150 km/h (93 mph) in level flight.
  - The bald eagle might reach up to 48 km/h (30 mph) in normal flight, but can dive faster, perhaps up to 112 km/h (70 mph).
  - Even the fastest eagles don't match the peregrine falcon's top speed.

To be precise, I should compare the fastest recorded speeds:
- Peregrine falcon: Up to 389 km/h (242 mph) in a dive.
- Eagles: The golden eagle is one of the fastest, with speeds up to 240-320 km/h (150-200 mph) in a dive, but I need to verify that.

Upon double-checking my knowledge:
- Actual speeds: Peregrine falcon's top speed is about 320 km/h in a dive.
- Golden eagle: Maximum speed is around 240-320 km/h in a stoop, but commonly cited as up to 200 km/h.
- Most sources say the peregrine falcon is faster than any eagle.

Is there any eagle faster than a peregrine falcon? From what I know, no. The peregrine falcon holds the record for the fastest bird.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the birds: Peregrine falcon vs. a general eagle. Since "eagle" isn't specified, I should consider the fastest eagle for a fair comparison.
2. Recall speeds:
   - Peregrine falcon: Fastest recorded speed in a dive is about 389 km/h, but typically 200-300 km/h.
   - Fastest eagle: Golden eagle, with speeds up to 240 km/h in a dive.
3. Compare: 389 km/h (peregrine) vs. 240 km/h (golden eagle). So, yes, peregrine is faster.
4. Even if we take average speeds, peregrine falcons are known to be faster in their hunting dives.
5. Conclusion: Based on general knowledge, the peregrine falcon is faster than any species of eagle.

Final answer should be Yes or No. Based on this, it's Yes.

Is there any context where an eagle might be faster? For example, in level flight? But the question doesn't specify, so we're likely talking about top speeds.

To be thorough:
- In level flight, peregrine falcons fly at about 65-90 km/h, while golden eagles can fly at 45-75 km/h, so even then, peregrine might be faster.
- But the question is about overall speed, and peregrine is renowned for its speed.

So, my reasoning leads to Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the birds and their speeds**: 
   - The peregrine falcon is a specific species known for its exceptional speed, particularly during its hunting dive (called a stoop). Its top speed is recorded at around 320–389 km/h (200–242 mph), making it the fastest bird in the world.
   - "Eagle" is a general term that refers to various species, such as the golden eagle, bald eagle, or African fish eagle. Their speeds vary, but the fastest eagle is typically the golden eagle, which can reach up to 240–320 km/h (150–200 mph) in a dive. Other eagles, like the bald eagle, are slower, with top speeds around 48–112 km/h (30–70 mph) in flight or dives.

2. **Compare the top speeds**:
   - Peregrine falcon: Up to 389 km/h in a dive.
   - Fastest eagle (e.g., golden eagle): Up to 320 km/h in a dive, but most reliable sources cite it closer to 240 km/h.
   - Even in the best case for eagles, the peregrine falcon's maximum speed exceeds that of any known eagle species.

3. **Consider context and variations**:
   - Speed can depend on factors like whether we're talking about level flight or dives. In level flight, peregrine falcons fly at about 65–90 km/h, while golden eagles fly at 45–75 km/h. However, the question doesn't specify, so we focus on overall or top speeds, where the peregrine falcon consistently outperforms.
   - No eagle species is documented to exceed the peregrine falcon's speed in any reliable records.

4. **Draw a conclusion**:
   - Based on the available data, the peregrine falcon is faster than any species of eagle in terms of maximum speed.

### Final Answer:  
Yes
