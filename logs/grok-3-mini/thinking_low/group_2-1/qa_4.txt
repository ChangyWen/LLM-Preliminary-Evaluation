*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Does the United States have a larger population than Canada?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Step 1: Recall the population figures. From my knowledge, the United States has a population of around 331 million people as of my last update. Canada has a population of about 38 million. These are approximate figures, but they're based on reliable data.

Step 2: Compare the two. Is 331 million larger than 38 million? Obviously, yes. 331 million is much greater than 38 million.

Step 3: Ensure the data is current. Population figures can change, but as of 2023, these numbers are accurate. The US is the third most populous country in the world, while Canada is much smaller in terms of population.

Step 4: Consider any caveats. Is there any chance that Canada's population has surged recently to overtake the US? Unlikely, as the US has a much larger land area and higher birth rates, immigration, etc. No recent events suggest otherwise.

Step 5: Structure the response. The user asked for a step-by-step reasoning process, so I need to outline my thoughts clearly, then end with the final answer.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- First, state the known populations.

- Second, perform the comparison.

- Third, conclude based on the comparison.

Final answer: Yes.

Make sure the response is neutral and factual.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Recall population data**: Based on reliable and up-to-date sources (as of my last knowledge update in 2023), the estimated population of the United States is approximately 331 million people. For Canada, the estimated population is around 38 million people. These figures are derived from sources like the U.S. Census Bureau and Statistics Canada.

2. **Compare the figures**: I need to determine if the U.S. population (331 million) is greater than Canada's population (38 million). Numerically, 331 million is clearly larger than 38 million.

3. **Consider potential factors**: Population numbers can fluctuate due to factors like birth rates, death rates, immigration, and emigration. However, there are no recent events or data trends (as of 2023) that suggest Canada's population has surpassed or is close to surpassing that of the United States. The U.S. has consistently had a much larger population for decades.

4. **Verify the context**: The question is straightforward, asking for a direct comparison. Based on the data, the United States has a significantly larger population.

5. **Conclusion**: After comparing the populations, the answer is affirmative.

### Final Answer:
Yes
