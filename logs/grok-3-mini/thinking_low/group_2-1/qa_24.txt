*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Does a day on Venus last longer than a day on Earth?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

What is a "day" in this context? Typically, a day refers to the time it takes for a planet to rotate once on its axis. So, we're talking about the length of a solar day or the sidereal day.

For Earth, a solar day is 24 hours, which is the time from noon to noon.

For Venus, I need to recall its rotation period. Venus has a very slow rotation. It rotates once every 243 Earth days, and it's retrograde, meaning it rotates in the opposite direction to its orbit.

Is that the sidereal day or the solar day? The sidereal day is the time it takes to rotate once relative to the stars, which for Venus is about 243 Earth days.

But for a solar day, which is what people usually mean by "day," it's the time from noon to noon, considering the planet's orbit.

Venus's solar day is actually shorter than its sidereal day because of its orbital motion.

Let me think carefully. On Earth, the solar day is slightly longer than the sidereal day because Earth is orbiting the Sun.

For Venus, since it rotates retrograde, the solar day might be different.

I remember that on Venus, a solar day (from sunrise to sunrise) is about 117 Earth days.

Yes, that's right. Venus's sidereal rotation period is 243 Earth days (retrograde), and its orbital period is about 225 Earth days.

The formula for the solar day is: 1 / (1 / sidereal day - 1 / orbital period)

More precisely, for a planet, the length of the solar day is 1 / (1 / sidereal day ± 1 / orbital period), depending on the direction.

Since Venus rotates retrograde, the solar day is shorter.

Let me calculate it roughly.

Sidereal day of Venus: 243 Earth days (retrograde)

Orbital period: 224.7 Earth days

Because it's retrograde, the rotation and orbit are in opposite directions, so they add up in effect.

The formula for solar day T_solar = 1 / (1 / T_sidereal + 1 / T_orbital) for retrograde rotation.

Generally, for prograde: 1 / T_solar = 1 / T_sidereal - 1 / T_orbital

For retrograde: 1 / T_solar = 1 / T_sidereal + 1 / T_orbital, since they are in opposite directions.

Let’s say T_sidereal = 243 days (positive for retrograde, but we need to be careful with signs).

Standardly, for Venus:

T_solar = T_sidereal * T_orbital / (T_orbital - T_sidereal) or something. I need to get this right.

I know from memory that a day on Venus (solar day) is 116.75 Earth days.

Yes, that's the fact: Venus's solar day is approximately 117 Earth days.

Whereas Earth's solar day is 1 Earth day.

So, clearly, 117 Earth days is longer than 1 Earth day.

Therefore, yes, a day on Venus lasts longer than a day on Earth.

Is that accurate? Let me double-check.

Earth's day: 24 hours = 1 day.

Venus's solar day: about 5832 hours, which is 116.75 * 24 hours, yes.

So, definitely longer.

Some people might confuse it with the year. Venus's year is 225 days, which is shorter than Earth's year, but the day is longer.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Define what a "day" means: Typically, the solar day, from noon to noon.

2. For Earth: Solar day = 24 hours.

3. For Venus: Solar day ≈ 117 Earth days.

4. Compare: 117 Earth days > 1 Earth day.

5. Therefore, yes.

Final answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Define a "day"**: In this context, a "day" refers to the solar day, which is the time it takes for a planet to rotate once on its axis relative to the Sun (e.g., from noon to noon). This is the most common way people think of a day.

2. **Earth's day**: Earth's solar day is approximately 24 hours. This is the length of time it takes for Earth to rotate once on its axis while accounting for its orbit around the Sun.

3. **Venus's day**: Venus has a sidereal rotation period (time to rotate once relative to the stars) of about 243 Earth days, and it rotates in a retrograde direction (opposite to its orbit). However, the solar day on Venus is the time from one sunrise to the next, which is approximately 116.75 Earth days. This is calculated by considering both Venus's rotation and its orbital period of about 224.7 Earth days.

4. **Comparison**: Now, compare the lengths:
   - Earth's solar day: 1 Earth day (24 hours).
   - Venus's solar day: 116.75 Earth days.
   - Clearly, 116.75 Earth days is much longer than 1 Earth day.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the solar day lengths, a day on Venus is longer than a day on Earth.

### Final Answer:
Yes
