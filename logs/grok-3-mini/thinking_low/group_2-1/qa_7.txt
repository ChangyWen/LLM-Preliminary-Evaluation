*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is a cheetah faster than a lion?" I need to provide a step-by-step reasoning process and end with a final answer of "Yes" or "No."

Key elements:
- Compare the speed of a cheetah and a lion.
- Use factual knowledge about animal speeds.
- Structure my response with steps.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Recall the top speeds of both animals.
   - Cheetah: Known as the fastest land animal. Its top speed is around 60-70 miles per hour (about 97-112 km/h).
   - Lion: A big cat, but not as fast as a cheetah. Lions can run up to about 35-50 miles per hour (about 56-80 km/h).

2. Verify these facts mentally:
   - Cheetah: Yes, it's documented that cheetahs can reach speeds up to 70 mph in short bursts.
   - Lion: Lions are sprinters too, but their maximum speed is lower, around 50 mph.

3. Compare the speeds:
   - Cheetah's speed: Up to 70 mph.
   - Lion's speed: Up to 50 mph.
   - Clearly, 70 mph > 50 mph, so cheetah is faster.

4. Consider any caveats:
   - Speed can vary by individual, terrain, etc., but generally, based on average top speeds, cheetah is faster.
   - The question is straightforward, so no need for exceptions unless specified.

5. Structure the response:
   - Start with step 1: State what I'm comparing.
   - Step 2: Provide the speeds.
   - Step 3: Compare them.
   - Step 4: Conclude with the answer.

Final answer: Based on the comparison, the answer is "Yes."

Ensure the response is neutral and factual.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Identify the key elements of the question**: The query asks whether a cheetah is faster than a lion. To answer this, I need to compare the top speeds of these two animals based on reliable biological and zoological data.

2. **Recall and verify the top speeds**:
   - Cheetah: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is widely recognized as the fastest land animal. Its top speed is approximately 60-70 miles per hour (mph) (about 97-112 kilometers per hour, or km/h), achieved in short bursts during hunts.
   - Lion: The lion (Panthera leo) is a powerful predator but not as specialized for speed as the cheetah. Its top speed is estimated to be around 35-50 mph (about 56-80 km/h), also in short sprints.

3. **Compare the speeds**:
   - The cheetah's maximum speed (up to 70 mph) is higher than the lion's maximum speed (up to 50 mph).
   - Even at the lower end of the cheetah's range (60 mph), it still exceeds the lion's top speed.

4. **Consider any relevant factors**:
   - These speeds are based on average data from wildlife studies and are not absolute for every individual animal, as factors like age, health, terrain, and motivation can affect performance.
   - However, in general comparisons, the cheetah is consistently faster due to its evolutionary adaptations for high-speed chases.

5. **Draw a conclusion**:
   - Based on the established top speeds, the cheetah is indeed faster than the lion.

### Final Answer: Yes
