*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Did Albert Einstein die later than Isaac Newton?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Step 1: Recall the birth and death dates of both individuals.

- Isaac Newton was born in 1643 and died in 1727.

- Albert Einstein was born in 1879 and died in 1955.

I should double-check these dates to ensure accuracy.

- Newton: Born December 25, 1642 (Julian calendar) or January 4, 1643 (Gregorian), and died March 20 or 31, 1727. Commonly accepted as 1642-1727.

- Einstein: Born March 14, 1879, and died April 18, 1955.

So, Newton's death year: 1727

Einstein's death year: 1955

Step 2: Compare the death years.

- 1955 is later than 1727.

Therefore, Einstein died later than Newton.

Step 3: Ensure there are no tricks or edge cases.

- The question is about who died later, so we're only comparing death dates.

- No need to consider exact dates within the year since the years are different and 1955 > 1727.

Step 4: Structure the response as requested.

- The user asked for step-by-step reasoning and a final answer (Yes or No).

So, my response should include:

- Step-by-step reasoning.

- End with "Yes" or "No".

Final Answer: Yes, because Einstein died in 1955, which is after Newton's death in 1727.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the key information needed**: To determine if Albert Einstein died later than Isaac Newton, I need to compare their dates of death.

2. **Recall the death dates**:
   - Isaac Newton was born in 1642 or 1643 (depending on the calendar) and died on March 31, 1727 (using the Gregorian calendar, which is the standard reference).
   - Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, and died on April 18, 1955.

3. **Compare the years of death**:
   - Newton's year of death: 1727.
   - Einstein's year of death: 1955.
   - Since 1955 is greater than 1727, Einstein's death occurred later.

4. **Consider any potential nuances**:
   - The question is about the order of their deaths, not the exact dates within the year. Even if we looked at the full dates, Einstein's death in April 1955 is still after Newton's in March 1727.
   - There are no historical disputes about these death dates that would alter the comparison.

5. **Draw a conclusion**:
   - Based on the comparison, Einstein died later than Newton.

### Final Answer: Yes
