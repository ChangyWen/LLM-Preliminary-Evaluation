*********************************** End of Inputs **************************************




*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Mount Everest taller than K2?" I need to reason step by step and end with a final answer of "Yes" or "No".

Step 1: Recall the heights of the mountains.
   - Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world. Its height is approximately 8,848 meters above sea level.
   - K2 is the second-highest mountain. Its height is about 8,611 meters above sea level.

Step 2: Compare the heights.
   - Everest: 8,848 meters
   - K2: 8,611 meters
   - Clearly, 8,848 > 8,611, so Everest is taller.

Step 3: Consider if there's any nuance.
   - The question is about height, which typically means elevation above sea level. There might be discussions about rock height or prominence, but the standard comparison is based on elevation.
   - No recent changes or disputes that I know of that would alter this fact.

Step 4: Structure the response.
   - The user asked for a step-by-step reasoning process.
   - I need to show my thought process clearly.
   - End with the final answer: "Yes" or "No".

Step 5: Final answer.
   - Since Everest is taller than K2, the answer is "Yes".

Organize the response:
- Start with step 1: State what I know about Everest.
- Step 2: State what I know about K2.
- Step 3: Direct comparison.
- Step 4: Conclusion.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the key information about the mountains**:  
   I know that Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, with an official height of approximately 8,848 meters above sea level, as measured by surveys and confirmed by organizations like the Nepal government and National Geographic.

2. **Compare with K2**:  
   K2, also known as Mount Godwin-Austen, is the second-highest mountain in the world. Its height is approximately 8,611 meters above sea level, based on standard measurements.

3. **Perform the direct comparison**:  
   - Mount Everest: 8,848 meters  
   - K2: 8,611 meters  
   Since 8,848 meters is greater than 8,611 meters, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

4. **Consider any potential nuances**:  
   Height comparisons are typically based on elevation above sea level. While there can be debates about other factors (like rock height or prominence), the standard metric for "taller" refers to the elevation I mentioned, and no credible sources dispute that Everest is higher.

5. **Reach a conclusion**:  
   Based on the heights, Mount Everest is indeed taller than K2.

### Final Answer:  
Yes
