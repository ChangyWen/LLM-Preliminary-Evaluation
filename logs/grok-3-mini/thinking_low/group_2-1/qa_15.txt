*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the speed of light faster than the speed of sound?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer as "Yes" or "No".

Step 1: Recall the speeds.
   - The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (km/s), or about 186,282 miles per second.
   - The speed of sound in air at room temperature is about 343 meters per second (m/s), which is 0.343 km/s.

Step 2: Compare the two speeds.
   - Speed of light: 299,792 km/s
   - Speed of sound: 0.343 km/s
   - Clearly, 299,792 km/s is much greater than 0.343 km/s.

Step 3: Consider any conditions.
   - The speed of light is constant in a vacuum, but it slows down in mediums like water or glass. However, the question doesn't specify a medium, so we assume the standard comparison: light in vacuum vs. sound in air.
   - Even in other mediums, the speed of light is still faster than the speed of sound. For example, in air, light travels at nearly 299,792 km/s, while sound is 0.343 km/s.

Step 4: Think about why this is true.
   - Light is an electromagnetic wave and travels through the vacuum of space at its maximum speed.
   - Sound is a mechanical wave that requires a medium to travel through, like air, water, or solids, and its speed depends on the medium's properties.

Step 5: Ensure the reasoning is step-by-step as requested.
   - Step 1: State the known speeds.
   - Step 2: Direct comparison.
   - Step 3: Address any potential caveats.
   - Step 4: Provide context if needed.
   - Step 5: Conclude with the answer.

Final Answer: Based on the comparison, yes, the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the speeds involved**:  
   The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (km/s). This is a fundamental constant in physics, denoted as 'c'.  
   The speed of sound varies depending on the medium, but in dry air at room temperature (around 20Â°C), it is approximately 343 meters per second (m/s), which is equivalent to 0.343 km/s.

2. **Convert units for direct comparison (if needed)**:  
   To compare easily, both speeds are in km/s:  
   - Speed of light: 299,792 km/s  
   - Speed of sound: 0.343 km/s  

3. **Perform the comparison**:  
   Compare the numerical values: 299,792 km/s (light) vs. 0.343 km/s (sound).  
   Clearly, 299,792 km/s is much greater than 0.343 km/s.

4. **Consider any conditions or exceptions**:  
   - The speed of light is fastest in a vacuum, but it slows down in denser mediums like water or glass (e.g., about 225,000 km/s in water). However, even in these mediums, it is still faster than the speed of sound in the same medium (e.g., sound in water is about 1,480 m/s or 1.48 km/s).  
   - The speed of sound depends on the medium and temperature (e.g., it's faster in solids than in gases), but under standard conditions, it is always significantly slower than the speed of light.

5. **Conclude based on the evidence**:  
   In all practical scenarios, the speed of light is greater than the speed of sound.

### Final Answer:  
Yes
