*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the atomic number of oxygen higher than that of carbon?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer as "Yes" or "No".

Step 1: Recall what atomic number means. The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element. It's also the position of the element in the periodic table.

Step 2: Remember the atomic numbers of carbon and oxygen.

- Carbon is element number 6. So, atomic number of carbon is 6.

- Oxygen is element number 8. So, atomic number of oxygen is 8.

Step 3: Compare the two atomic numbers.

- Atomic number of oxygen: 8

- Atomic number of carbon: 6

Is 8 higher than 6? Yes, it is.

Step 4: Ensure there's no trick here. The question is straightforward. It's about atomic numbers, not atomic mass or anything else.

Step 5: Structure my response as per the instructions: Show step-by-step reasoning and end with the final answer (Yes or No).

Final Answer: Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the concept of atomic number**: The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element. It determines the element's position in the periodic table.

2. **Recall the atomic number of carbon**: Carbon is the 6th element in the periodic table, so its atomic number is 6.

3. **Recall the atomic number of oxygen**: Oxygen is the 8th element in the periodic table, so its atomic number is 8.

4. **Compare the atomic numbers**: We need to compare 8 (oxygen) and 6 (carbon). Since 8 is greater than 6, the atomic number of oxygen is higher than that of carbon.

5. **Verify the comparison**: There are no exceptions or special cases here, as atomic numbers are fixed and based on the standard periodic table.

### Final Answer:  
Yes
