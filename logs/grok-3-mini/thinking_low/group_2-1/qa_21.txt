*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Japan located east of China?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of "Yes" or "No."

Step 1: Understand the geographical positions.
   - China is in East Asia, with its eastern coast along the Pacific Ocean.
   - Japan is an island nation in the Pacific Ocean, east of the Asian mainland.

Step 2: Recall basic geography.
   - If I look at a map of Asia, China is on the continent, and Japan is to the east of it, separated by the East China Sea.
   - For example, major cities: Beijing in China is at about 116° E longitude, and Tokyo in Japan is at about 139° E longitude. So, Tokyo is further east than Beijing.

Step 3: Consider the overall location.
   - The question is about Japan as a whole versus China as a whole. Japan's main islands are all east of China's eastern border.
   - China's easternmost point is around 135° E (e.g., near Vladivostok, but that's actually Russia; wait, no, China's easternmost is in Heilongjiang or along the coast).
   - Actually, China's easternmost longitude is about 135° E in the east, and Japan's starts from around 123° E for its westernmost islands, but the main islands like Honshu are further east.
   - To simplify: Generally, Japan is east of China.

Step 4: Address any exceptions.
   - Is there any part of Japan west of China? No, Japan is entirely east of China. The Ryukyu Islands are south, but still east of Taiwan, which is part of China (though politically disputed).
   - So, overall, yes, Japan is east of China.

Step 5: Think about the question's simplicity.
   - This is a straightforward geographical question. No need for political nuances unless specified.

Step 6: Structure the response.
   - The user asked for step-by-step reasoning, so I need to outline my thought process clearly.
   - End with a final answer: Yes or No.

Final Answer: Based on my reasoning, the answer is Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the question**: The query asks whether Japan is located east of China. This is a geographical question, so I'll base my reasoning on standard world maps, longitude lines, and general knowledge of East Asia.

2. **Recall the geographical positions**:
   - China is a large country in East Asia, with its mainland extending from approximately 73° E to 135° E longitude. Its eastern border is along the Pacific Ocean, including the East China Sea.
   - Japan is an archipelago (a chain of islands) in the Pacific Ocean. Its main islands (like Honshu, where Tokyo is located) range from about 123° E to 146° E longitude.

3. **Compare the locations**:
   - If we look at a standard map, China's easternmost points (e.g., along its coastline in provinces like Shandong or Zhejiang) are west of Japan's westernmost major islands.
   - For example:
     - Beijing, China, is at approximately 116° E.
     - Tokyo, Japan, is at approximately 139° E.
   - This means that Japan's primary landmasses are further east than China's eastern borders.

4. **Consider any exceptions**:
   - Japan's southern islands (like the Ryukyu Islands) are south of China but still east of the Chinese mainland.
   - There are no parts of Japan that extend west of China's longitude; the entire country is situated to the east, separated by the East China Sea.

5. **Verify with general knowledge**:
   - In geographical terms, when we say "east of," we mean relative to the standard orientation of maps (with east to the right). Based on this, Japan is indeed east of China.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - After comparing the longitudes and considering the overall positions, Japan is located east of China.

### Final Answer: Yes
