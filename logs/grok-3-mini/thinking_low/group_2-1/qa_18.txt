*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the distance from Earth to the Sun greater than the distance from Earth to the Moon?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Step 1: Recall the actual distances.
   - The average distance from Earth to the Sun is about 149,600,000 kilometers, or 1 astronomical unit (AU).
   - The average distance from Earth to the Moon is about 384,400 kilometers.

Step 2: Compare the two distances.
   - Earth to Sun: 149,600,000 km
   - Earth to Moon: 384,400 km
   - Clearly, 149,600,000 km is much larger than 384,400 km.

Step 3: Perform a simple calculation to confirm.
   - Divide the distance to the Sun by the distance to the Moon: 149,600,000 / 384,400 ≈ 389.2
   - This means the distance to the Sun is about 389 times greater than to the Moon.

Step 4: Ensure there are no tricks or exceptions.
   - The question uses average distances, which are standard for such comparisons.
   - Distances can vary slightly due to orbits, but the Sun is always vastly farther away than the Moon.

Step 5: Conclude the answer.
   - Based on the comparison, yes, the distance from Earth to the Sun is greater than from Earth to the Moon.

Final Answer: Yes

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the distances involved:**
   - The average distance from Earth to the Sun is approximately 149,600,000 kilometers (this is also known as 1 astronomical unit, or AU).
   - The average distance from Earth to the Moon is approximately 384,400 kilometers.

2. **Compare the two distances:**
   - We need to determine if 149,600,000 km (Earth to Sun) is greater than 384,400 km (Earth to Moon).
   - Numerically, 149,600,000 km is clearly larger than 384,400 km.

3. **Perform a simple calculation for confirmation:**
   - Divide the distance to the Sun by the distance to the Moon:  
     149,600,000 km ÷ 384,400 km ≈ 389.2  
     This means the distance to the Sun is about 389 times greater than the distance to the Moon.

4. **Consider any variations:**
   - Distances can vary slightly due to the elliptical shapes of orbits (e.g., the Moon's distance from Earth ranges from about 363,000 km to 405,000 km, and Earth's distance from the Sun varies slightly throughout the year).
   - However, even at their closest points, the Earth-to-Sun distance is still vastly greater than the Earth-to-Moon distance.

5. **Draw a conclusion:**
   - Based on the standard average distances and the comparison, the distance from Earth to the Sun is indeed greater than the distance from Earth to the Moon.

### Final Answer:  
Yes
