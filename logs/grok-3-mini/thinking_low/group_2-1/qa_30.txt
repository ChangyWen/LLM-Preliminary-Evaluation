*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the average human lifespan longer than that of a dog?" I need to reason step by step and end with a final answer of "Yes" or "No."

Key elements:
- Average human lifespan
- Average dog lifespan
- Compare the two

Step 1: Recall or estimate average lifespans.
- For humans: The global average lifespan is around 72-73 years. According to reliable sources like the World Health Organization, it's approximately 73 years.
- For dogs: This varies by breed and size, but the average lifespan for dogs is generally 10-13 years. Smaller dogs live longer (up to 15-20 years), while larger ones live shorter (7-10 years). A commonly cited average is about 10-12 years.

I should use general knowledge based on facts. Let's confirm:
- Human average: Around 72.6 years globally (as per recent data).
- Dog average: The American Kennel Club or similar sources say 10-13 years is standard.

Step 2: Compare the two.
- Human: ~73 years
- Dog: ~10-13 years
- Clearly, 73 years is greater than 10-13 years.

Step 3: Consider any caveats.
- Is there any type of dog that lives longer? Some small breeds like Chihuahuas can live up to 20 years, but that's not the average.
- For humans, lifespans vary by country, but the global average is still much higher.
- The question says "a dog," which I interpret as the average dog, not a specific one.

Step 4: Ensure the reasoning is step-by-step as requested.
- Step 1: State what the average human lifespan is.
- Step 2: State what the average dog lifespan is.
- Step 3: Compare them.
- Step 4: Conclude with yes or no.

Step 5: Final answer should be just "Yes" or "No," as specified.

Structure my response:
- Begin with reasoning.
- End with the final answer.

Final reasoning:
- Average human lifespan: Approximately 73 years.
- Average dog lifespan: Approximately 10-13 years.
- Since 73 > 13 (the upper end for dogs), the answer is yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Define the key terms**: The question asks about the *average human lifespan* compared to the *average dog lifespan*. I need to use reliable estimates based on general knowledge and data from sources like the World Health Organization (WHO) for humans and veterinary organizations for dogs.

2. **Determine the average human lifespan**: According to the WHO and other global health data, the global average lifespan for humans is approximately 73 years. This figure can vary by region (e.g., higher in developed countries like Japan, around 84 years, and lower in some developing regions), but the worldwide average is around 72-73 years.

3. **Determine the average dog lifespan**: The lifespan of dogs varies significantly by breed, size, and care, but according to sources like the American Kennel Club (AKC) and veterinary studies, the average lifespan for dogs is generally 10-13 years. Smaller breeds (e.g., Chihuahuas) may live up to 15-20 years, while larger breeds (e.g., Great Danes) may live only 7-10 years. The commonly accepted average across all breeds is about 10-12 years.

4. **Compare the two averages**: 
   - Human average: ~73 years
   - Dog average: ~10-13 years
   - Clearly, 73 years is greater than 13 years (the upper end of the dog average). Even if we consider the higher end for dogs, the human lifespan is still longer.

5. **Consider any exceptions or limitations**: While some dogs (e.g., very small or well-cared-for breeds) might outlive certain humans in specific cases, the question is about averages. On average, humans live longer than dogs due to factors like better healthcare, diet, and evolutionary differences.

6. **Draw a conclusion**: Based on the comparison, the average human lifespan is longer than the average dog lifespan.

### Final Answer: Yes
