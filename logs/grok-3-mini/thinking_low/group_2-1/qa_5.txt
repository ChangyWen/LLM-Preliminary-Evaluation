*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Russia larger in area than Australia?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Step 1: Recall the land areas of Russia and Australia.

From my knowledge:
- Russia is the largest country in the world by land area.
- Its total area is approximately 17,098,242 square kilometers.
- Australia is the sixth largest country by land area.
- Its total area is about 7,692,024 square kilometers.

I should double-check these figures to ensure accuracy. Based on standard geographical facts:
- Russia's land area: Around 17 million square kilometers.
- Australia's land area: Around 7.6 million square kilometers.

Yes, that's correct.

Step 2: Compare the two areas.

- Russia: 17,098,242 km²
- Australia: 7,692,024 km²

Clearly, 17,098,242 km² is greater than 7,692,024 km².

Step 3: Consider any caveats.

- Is this comparing total area or land area only? The question says "larger in area," which typically means total land area, including inland water bodies.
- Russia includes vast territories in Europe and Asia, while Australia is a continent and a country.
- No need to consider exclusive economic zones; it's about land area.

Step 4: Ensure the data is reliable.

I'm basing this on widely accepted facts from sources like the CIA World Factbook or Wikipedia. For example:
- Russia: 17,098,246 km² (total area)
- Australia: 7,741,220 km² (sometimes listed differently, but generally around 7.6-7.7 million km²)

Upon second thought, I should use precise figures:
- Official figures might vary slightly, but Russia is indisputably larger.

Step 5: Structure the response.

The user asked for step-by-step reasoning, so I need to outline it clearly:
1. State the areas.
2. Compare them.
3. Conclude.

Final answer: Yes, because Russia's area is larger.

Step 6: Phrase the response.

- Start with reasoning.
- End with "Yes" or "No".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the areas of the countries**: 
   - Russia's total land area is approximately 17,098,242 square kilometers (km²). This makes it the largest country in the world by land area.
   - Australia's total land area is approximately 7,692,024 square kilometers (km²). It is the sixth-largest country by land area.

2. **Compare the areas**:
   - To determine if Russia is larger, I compare the two figures: 17,098,242 km² (Russia) vs. 7,692,024 km² (Australia).
   - 17,098,242 km² is greater than 7,692,024 km².

3. **Consider any relevant factors**:
   - The comparison is based on total land area, which includes land and inland water bodies but excludes maritime claims.
   - There are no significant disputes or alternative measurements that would change this conclusion, as these figures are widely accepted from reliable sources like the CIA World Factbook and official geographical data.

4. **Draw a conclusion**:
   - Since Russia's area is larger than Australia's, the answer is affirmative.

### Final Answer: Yes
