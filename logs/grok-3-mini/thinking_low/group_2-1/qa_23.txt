*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the pH of lemon juice lower than that of water?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer as "Yes" or "No".

Step 1: Understand pH. pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. It's defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration: pH = -log[H+]. A lower pH means a higher concentration of H+ ions, which means the solution is more acidic.

Step 2: Know the pH of water. Pure water is neutral, with a pH of 7 at 25°C. This is because water auto-ionizes to produce equal amounts of H+ and OH- ions.

Step 3: Know the pH of lemon juice. Lemon juice is acidic due to the citric acid it contains. From general knowledge, the pH of lemon juice is around 2 to 3, which is much lower than 7.

Step 4: Compare the two. If lemon juice has a pH of about 2-3 and water has a pH of 7, then 2-3 is less than 7. Therefore, the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water.

Step 5: Consider any caveats. The question says "water," which I assume means pure water. If it's tap water, it might be slightly acidic or basic, but typically, we refer to pure water in such contexts. Even tap water is around 6-8, still higher than lemon juice's pH.

Step 6: Ensure the reasoning is step-by-step as requested:

- Define pH.

- State pH of water.

- State pH of lemon juice.

- Compare the values.

- Conclude.

Final answer: Based on the comparison, yes, the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand pH**: pH is a scale used to measure the acidity or basicity of a solution. It is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration: pH = -log[H+]. A lower pH value indicates a higher concentration of hydrogen ions (H+), meaning the solution is more acidic. For example, a pH below 7 is acidic, a pH of 7 is neutral, and a pH above 7 is basic.

2. **pH of water**: Pure water is neutral at room temperature (around 25°C) because it has an equal concentration of H+ and OH- ions from auto-ionization. The pH of pure water is approximately 7. (Note: Tap water might vary slightly due to impurities, but the question likely refers to pure water.)

3. **pH of lemon juice**: Lemon juice contains citric acid, which makes it acidic. The typical pH of lemon juice ranges from about 2 to 3, depending on factors like ripeness and concentration.

4. **Comparison**: To determine if the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water, compare the values:
   - pH of lemon juice: 2–3
   - pH of water: 7
   - Since 2–3 is less than 7, the pH of lemon juice is lower.

5. **Conclusion**: A lower pH means lemon juice is more acidic than water, confirming the comparison.

### Final Answer:
Yes
