*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Australia larger in area than Russia?" I need to compare the land areas of Australia and Russia.

I recall that Russia is the largest country in the world by land area. Australia is the sixth largest. Let me double-check my knowledge.

From what I know:

- Russia's total area is about 17,098,242 square kilometers.

- Australia's total area is about 7,692,024 square kilometers.

These are approximate figures, but they should be accurate enough for this comparison.

Is Australia including its territories? Australia is a continent and a country, so its area is the mainland plus Tasmania and other islands.

Russia spans across Europe and Asia, making it vast.

To confirm:

- Russia: Approximately 17 million square km.

- Australia: Approximately 7.7 million square km.

Clearly, 7.7 million is less than 17 million, so Australia is smaller.

The question is about area, which I assume means total land area. Sometimes people might confuse with exclusive economic zones, but that's not standard for country comparisons.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall the approximate land areas:

   - Russia: 17,098,242 km²

   - Australia: 7,692,024 km²

2. Compare the two numbers: 7,692,024 < 17,098,242

3. Therefore, Australia is not larger than Russia; Russia is larger.

4. The answer should be "No".

I should ensure there are no tricks. Is there any way Australia could be considered larger? For example, if we include Antarctica claims, but Australia doesn't claim Antarctica; it's the Australian Antarctic Territory, which isn't part of Australia's sovereign area.

No, for standard comparisons, Russia is definitively larger.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Identify the key information needed**: To answer whether Australia is larger in area than Russia, I need to compare the total land areas of both countries. This typically refers to their official land areas as recognized internationally.

2. **Recall reliable data on land areas**:
   - Russia's total land area is approximately 17,098,242 square kilometers (km²). It is the largest country in the world by land area.
   - Australia's total land area is approximately 7,692,024 square kilometers (km²). It is the sixth-largest country by land area.

3. **Compare the figures**:
   - Russia's area: 17,098,242 km²
   - Australia's area: 7,692,024 km²
   - Performing a direct comparison: 7,692,024 km² (Australia) is less than 17,098,242 km² (Russia).

4. **Consider any potential nuances**:
   - The comparison is based on total land area, which includes mainland and associated islands but excludes territorial waters or exclusive economic zones.
   - There are no special cases (e.g., disputed territories) that would alter this comparison for standard geographical purposes. Australia's area does not include any Antarctic claims as part of its sovereign territory.

5. **Draw a conclusion**: Based on the comparison, Australia is smaller in area than Russia.

### Final Answer:
No.
