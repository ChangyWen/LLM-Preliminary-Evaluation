*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the average lifespan of a dog longer than that of a human?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Key elements:
- Average lifespan of a dog
- Average lifespan of a human
- Compare the two

From my knowledge:
- The average lifespan of a human is around 70 to 80 years, depending on the country. For example, in developed countries, it's about 70-85 years. Globally, it's approximately 73 years according to recent data.
- For dogs, the average lifespan varies by breed, but generally, it's much shorter. Small dogs might live 12-15 years, medium dogs 10-13 years, and large dogs 7-10 years. The overall average for dogs is around 10-13 years.

I should use reliable estimates:
- Human average lifespan: According to the World Health Organization, the global average life expectancy at birth is about 73 years.
- Dog average lifespan: Various sources like the American Kennel Club state that the average lifespan for dogs is 10-13 years.

Comparing these:
- 10-13 years (dogs) vs. 73 years (humans)
- Clearly, 10-13 is less than 73.

Is there any context where dogs live longer? Like, in rare cases or specific breeds? No, even the longest-living dogs don't exceed 20-25 years, which is still far less than humans.

The question specifies "average lifespan," so I should stick to averages, not exceptions.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Recall the average lifespan of humans: Approximately 73 years globally.
2. Recall the average lifespan of dogs: Approximately 10-13 years.
3. Compare the two values: 10-13 years < 73 years.
4. Therefore, the average lifespan of a dog is not longer than that of a human.

Final answer should be: No.

Make sure the response is structured as requested:
- Show step-by-step reasoning.
- End with the final answer (Yes or No).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Define the key terms**: The question asks about the *average lifespan*, which refers to the typical length of life for a species based on reliable data. I'll compare the global average lifespan of dogs and humans.

2. **Gather data on human lifespan**: According to sources like the World Health Organization (WHO), the global average life expectancy for humans is approximately 73 years. This varies by region (e.g., higher in developed countries like Japan at around 84 years, and lower in some developing regions), but the worldwide average is around 73 years.

3. **Gather data on dog lifespan**: The average lifespan of dogs depends on factors like breed, size, and care, but generally, it's much shorter. Small breeds (e.g., Chihuahuas) may live 12-15 years, medium breeds (e.g., Beagles) about 10-13 years, and large breeds (e.g., Great Danes) about 7-10 years. According to organizations like the American Kennel Club (AKC), the overall average lifespan for dogs is estimated to be 10-13 years.

4. **Compare the two averages**: 
   - Human average: ~73 years.
   - Dog average: ~10-13 years.
   - Clearly, 10-13 years is less than 73 years.

5. **Consider any exceptions or nuances**: While some dogs (e.g., very small breeds or exceptionally well-cared-for ones) might live up to 15-20 years in rare cases, this doesn't change the average. Even the longest-lived dogs don't approach human lifespans. The question is about averages, so outliers aren't relevant.

6. **Draw a conclusion**: Based on the comparison, the average lifespan of a dog is shorter than that of a human.

### Final Answer: No
