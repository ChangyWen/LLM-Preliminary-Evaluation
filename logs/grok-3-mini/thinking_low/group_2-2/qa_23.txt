*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Recall what pH means. pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. It's defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration: pH = -log[H+]. Lower pH values mean more acidic (higher [H+]), and higher pH values mean more basic (lower [H+]).

Pure water is neutral, so its pH is 7 at 25°C.

Lemon juice is acidic because it contains citric acid. The pH of lemon juice is typically around 2 to 3. I think it's about 2.2 to 2.4 for fresh lemon juice.

So, comparing the two:

- pH of water: 7

- pH of lemon juice: approximately 2-3

Is 7 lower than 2-3? No, 7 is greater than 2-3. A lower pH means more acidic, so lemon juice has a lower pH than water.

The question is: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?" That means, is pH_water < pH_lemon juice?

From above, pH_water = 7, pH_lemon juice ≈ 2-3, so 7 is not less than 2-3; it's greater.

Therefore, the answer should be No.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand pH: Lower pH indicates a more acidic solution.

2. pH of pure water: 7 (neutral).

3. pH of lemon juice: Acidic, typically 2-3.

4. Compare: Is 7 < 2-3? No, 7 > 2-3.

5. So, the pH of water is not lower than that of lemon juice.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand pH**: pH is a scale that measures the acidity or basicity of a solution. It is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration (pH = -log[H+]). A lower pH value indicates a more acidic solution, while a higher pH value indicates a more basic (or less acidic) solution. The neutral pH is 7.

2. **pH of water**: Pure water is neutral at room temperature (around 25°C), so its pH is 7.

3. **pH of lemon juice**: Lemon juice is acidic due to the presence of citric acid. The typical pH of lemon juice ranges from about 2 to 3, depending on factors like ripeness and concentration. For example, fresh lemon juice is often around 2.2 to 2.4.

4. **Compare the pH values**: 
   - pH of water: 7
   - pH of lemon juice: Approximately 2-3
   - The question asks if the pH of water (7) is lower than the pH of lemon juice (2-3). Numerically, 7 is greater than 2-3, so the pH of water is not lower.

5. **Conclusion**: Since the pH of water (7) is higher than the pH of lemon juice (2-3), the statement "the pH of water is lower than that of lemon juice" is false.

### Final Answer:
No
