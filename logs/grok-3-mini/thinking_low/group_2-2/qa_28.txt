*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is an eagle faster than a peregrine falcon?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Key elements: Compare the speed of an eagle and a peregrine falcon. I should recall or know the typical speeds of these birds.

From my knowledge:

- Peregrine falcons are known for being the fastest birds in the world. They can reach speeds over 200 mph during their hunting dives, called stoops.

- Eagles are fast too, but not as fast as peregrine falcons. The fastest eagles, like the golden eagle, can fly at around 30-50 mph in level flight, and maybe up to 100 mph in dives, but that's still less than the peregrine.

I need to be precise. Let me double-check my facts:

- Peregrine falcon: Top speed in dive is about 240 mph (386 km/h).

- Eagles: For example, the bald eagle can fly at 30-35 mph, and dive at up to 100 mph. Golden eagles might reach 150-200 mph in a dive, but I'm not sure. Upon second thought, I think golden eagles can dive at speeds up to 150 mph, but still not matching the peregrine.

Actually, reliable sources say:

- Peregrine falcon: Up to 242 mph (389 km/h) in a dive.

- Golden eagle: Up to 150 mph (240 km/h) in a dive.

- Other eagles are slower.

So, generally, the peregrine falcon is faster than any eagle.

The question doesn't specify which eagle, but I think it's safe to assume it's comparing typical eagles to the peregrine falcon.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the speeds:

   - Peregrine falcon: Known as the fastest bird, with speeds exceeding 200 mph in dives.

   - Eagles: Various species, but the fastest is probably the golden eagle at around 150 mph.

2. Compare the two: Is the eagle's top speed greater than the peregrine falcon's? No, because even the fastest eagle is slower than the peregrine.

3. Consider context: Speed can mean different things, like cruising speed vs. diving speed. The question doesn't specify, but typically, when comparing bird speeds, we refer to their maximum speeds.

4. Conclusion: Based on this, an eagle is not faster than a peregrine falcon.

Final answer should be: No.

Is there any eagle that might be faster? From what I know, no. The peregrine holds the record.

Alright, structure my response:

- Step 1: State what I know about peregrine falcon's speed.

- Step 2: State what I know about eagles' speeds.

- Step 3: Compare them.

- Step 4: Give the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the question**: The query asks whether an eagle is faster than a peregrine falcon. To answer this, I need to compare the top speeds of these birds. Speed in birds can refer to various types, such as cruising speed or diving speed, but typically, when comparing, we focus on their maximum recorded speeds.

2. **Research and recall key facts on peregrine falcon speed**:
   - The peregrine falcon is widely recognized as the fastest bird in the world.
   - Its top speed is achieved during a hunting dive (called a stoop), where it can reach up to approximately 240 mph (386 km/h). This is based on reliable observations and studies.

3. **Research and recall key facts on eagle speed**:
   - Eagles vary by species, but the fastest eagle is generally considered to be the golden eagle.
   - The golden eagle's top speed is around 150 mph (240 km/h) during a dive. Other eagles, like the bald eagle, are slower, with top speeds of about 30-50 mph in level flight and up to 100 mph in dives.
   - Even the fastest eagle does not exceed the peregrine falcon's speed.

4. **Compare the speeds**:
   - Peregrine falcon: Up to 240 mph.
   - Fastest eagle (e.g., golden eagle): Up to 150 mph.
   - Clearly, the peregrine falcon's maximum speed is higher than that of any known eagle species.

5. **Consider any caveats**:
   - Speed can depend on context (e.g., level flight vs. dive), but the question doesn't specify. Using maximum speeds is the standard for such comparisons.
   - There are no documented cases where an eagle surpasses the peregrine falcon's speed.

6. **Draw a conclusion**:
   - Based on the comparison, an eagle is not faster than a peregrine falcon.

### Final Answer:
No
