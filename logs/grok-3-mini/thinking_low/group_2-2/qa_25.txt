*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth less than that on the Moon?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Step 1: Recall what acceleration due to gravity means. It's the rate at which an object accelerates when falling freely under gravity. On Earth, it's approximately 9.8 m/s². On the Moon, it's much less.

Step 2: Confirm the values. The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is about 9.8 m/s². On the Moon, it's about 1.6 m/s². So, Earth's gravity is stronger than the Moon's.

Step 3: Compare the two. Is 9.8 m/s² less than 1.6 m/s²? No, 9.8 is greater than 1.6.

Step 4: The question asks if Earth's gravity is less than the Moon's. Based on the values, Earth's is greater, so the answer should be No.

Step 5: Make sure I'm not missing anything. Gravity depends on the mass of the planet and its radius. The formula is g = G*M / R², where M is mass and R is radius. Earth has a much larger mass than the Moon, so its g is higher.

Step 6: Double-check the question: "Is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth less than that on the Moon?" So, is Earth's g < Moon's g? No, Earth's g > Moon's g.

Step 7: Final answer should be Yes or No. Based on my reasoning, it's No.

Structure my response:

- Start with step-by-step reasoning.

- End with the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the concept**: Acceleration due to gravity (denoted as \(g\)) is the rate at which an object accelerates when falling freely under gravity. It depends on the mass of the celestial body and its radius, according to the formula \(g = \frac{G \cdot M}{R^2}\), where \(G\) is the gravitational constant, \(M\) is the mass, and \(R\) is the radius.

2. **Recall the values**: 
   - On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately \(9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\).
   - On the Moon, it is approximately \(1.6 \, \text{m/s}^2\).

3. **Compare the values**: We need to determine if Earth's \(g\) (9.8 m/s²) is less than the Moon's \(g\) (1.6 m/s²). Numerically, 9.8 is greater than 1.6.

4. **Reason based on physics**: Earth's greater mass and smaller radius relative to its size result in a stronger gravitational pull compared to the Moon. This is why objects weigh less on the Moon and astronauts can jump higher there.

5. **Answer the question**: The question asks if the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is less than that on the Moon. Based on the comparison, it is not.

### Final Answer:
No
