*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Does Mars have more moons than the Earth?" I need to answer with a step-by-step reasoning process and end with a final answer of "Yes" or "No".

Step 1: Recall the facts about moons of Earth and Mars.

- Earth has 1 moon. It's the only natural satellite orbiting Earth.

- Mars has two moons: Phobos and Deimos.

Step 2: Compare the numbers.

- Number of moons for Earth: 1

- Number of moons for Mars: 2

Since 2 is greater than 1, Mars has more moons than Earth.

Step 3: Ensure accuracy. Are there any recent discoveries or exceptions?

- As of my last knowledge update, Earth still has only one moon.

- Mars has two confirmed moons. No other moons have been discovered for Mars.

Step 4: Structure the response.

- The user asked for a step-by-step reasoning process, so I need to outline my thought process clearly.

- End with the final answer: "Yes" or "No".

Final answer: Yes, because Mars has more moons (2) than Earth (1).

Step 5: Make it clear and concise. Start with reasoning steps and conclude.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the number of moons for each planet:**  
   - Earth has 1 natural satellite, commonly known as the Moon.  
   - Mars has 2 known moons, named Phobos and Deimos.

2. **Compare the numbers:**  
   - Earth's moons: 1  
   - Mars's moons: 2  
   - Since 2 is greater than 1, Mars has more moons than Earth.

3. **Verify based on current knowledge:**  
   - There are no recent discoveries or disputes that change these facts. Earth has only one confirmed moon, and Mars has two.

4. **Conclude the comparison:**  
   - Based on the above, Mars indeed has more moons than Earth.

### Final Answer:  
Yes
