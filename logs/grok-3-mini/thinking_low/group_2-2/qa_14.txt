*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Does an elephant have a larger heart than a blue whale?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Key elements: Compare the size of the heart of an elephant versus a blue whale. "Larger" probably means in terms of physical size, like volume or weight.

Step 1: Recall basic facts about these animals.
- Elephants are the largest land animals. The African elephant can weigh up to about 6-7 tons.
- Blue whales are the largest animals ever, living in the ocean. They can weigh up to 200 tons or more.

Step 2: Think about heart size in relation to body size.
- Generally, larger animals have larger hearts because they need to pump blood through a bigger body. So, the blue whale, being much larger, should have a larger heart.

Step 3: Look for specific data if possible. I should base this on known facts.
- From my knowledge:
  - An elephant's heart weighs about 12-22 kg (for an African elephant).
  - A blue whale's heart can weigh up to 600 kg or more. I've heard it's about the size of a small car.

Step 4: Verify or estimate.
- Elephant: Adult African elephant heart is approximately 12-21 kg.
- Blue whale: The heart of a blue whale is estimated to be around 400-600 kg. I think it's one of the largest hearts in the animal kingdom.

Step 5: Compare the numbers.
- Elephant heart: Let's say 20 kg (average).
- Blue whale heart: 500 kg (conservative estimate).
- Clearly, 500 kg is much larger than 20 kg.

Step 6: Consider if "larger" could mean something else, like in proportion to body size. But the question doesn't specify; it just says "larger heart," which typically means absolute size.

Step 7: Ensure accuracy. Is there any chance an elephant has a larger heart? Unlikely, given the vast size difference.

Step 8: Final answer should be straightforward: Yes or No.
- Based on this, the answer is No, the elephant does not have a larger heart than the blue whale.

Step 9: Structure the response.
- Start with step-by-step reasoning.
- End with the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The query asks whether an elephant has a larger heart than a blue whale, likely referring to the physical size of the heart (e.g., weight or volume). I'll compare the two based on general biological knowledge and available data.

2. **Compare the Animals' Sizes**: 
   - Elephants (e.g., African elephants) are the largest land animals, weighing up to 6-7 tons (6,000-7,000 kg).
   - Blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, weighing up to 150-200 tons (150,000-200,000 kg). This massive size difference suggests that the blue whale's organs, including its heart, would generally be larger to support its body.

3. **Heart Size in Animals**: 
   - Heart size typically scales with body size. Larger animals need larger hearts to pump blood efficiently through their bodies.
   - For elephants: The heart of an adult African elephant weighs approximately 12-22 kg (about 26-49 pounds). This is based on anatomical studies.
   - For blue whales: The heart of a blue whale is estimated to weigh around 400-600 kg (880-1,320 pounds), which is roughly the size of a small car. This is one of the largest hearts in the animal kingdom.

4. **Direct Comparison**:
   - Elephant heart: Up to about 22 kg.
   - Blue whale heart: Up to about 600 kg.
   - Clearly, the blue whale's heart is significantly larger in absolute terms (weight and volume).

5. **Consider Other Factors**:
   - Could "larger" mean something else, like proportional size (e.g., heart weight relative to body weight)? The question doesn't specify, but even proportionally, the blue whale's heart is adapted for its size and isn't smaller. However, since the question seems to imply absolute size, I'll stick to that.
   - There are no known exceptions or anomalies where an elephant's heart would be larger than a blue whale's based on current scientific data.

6. **Conclusion Based on Evidence**: After comparing the estimated heart weights, it's evident that the blue whale has a much larger heart than an elephant.

### Final Answer: No
