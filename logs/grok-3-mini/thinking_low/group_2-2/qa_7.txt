*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is a lion faster than a cheetah?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Key facts I know:
- Cheetahs are known as the fastest land animals.
- The top speed of a cheetah is around 60-70 miles per hour (about 97-112 km/h).
- Lions are fast, but not as fast as cheetahs. Lions can run up to about 35-50 miles per hour (around 56-80 km/h).

I should verify these from reliable knowledge:
- Cheetah: Maximum speed is approximately 58-75 mph, with bursts up to 70 mph.
- Lion: Their sprint speed is about 35-50 mph.

Comparing:
- Cheetah's top speed: 70 mph
- Lion's top speed: 50 mph

So, clearly, 70 mph is greater than 50 mph, meaning the cheetah is faster than the lion.

The question is "Is a lion faster than a cheetah?" So, if the lion's speed is less than the cheetah's, the answer should be No.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the speeds of both animals.
2. Compare the speeds.
3. Determine if the lion's speed is greater than the cheetah's.

Step 1: Research or recall speeds.
   - Cheetah: Up to 70 mph.
   - Lion: Up to 50 mph.

Step 2: Comparison: 50 mph (lion) vs. 70 mph (cheetah). 50 < 70, so lion is slower.

Step 3: Therefore, the lion is not faster than the cheetah.

Final answer: No.

I should ensure there are no caveats. For example, are there any conditions where a lion might be faster? Like, in short bursts or something? But generally, based on standard knowledge, cheetahs are faster.

The question doesn't specify context, so I'll go with the general top speeds.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the top speeds of the animals**:  
   - A cheetah is widely recognized as the fastest land animal. Its top speed is approximately 58-75 miles per hour (mph), with reliable sources often citing around 70 mph in short bursts.  
   - A lion, while agile and a strong hunter, has a top speed of about 35-50 mph, with 50 mph being the upper limit for short sprints.

2. **Compare the speeds**:  
   - Cheetah's top speed: Up to 70 mph.  
   - Lion's top speed: Up to 50 mph.  
   - Since 50 mph (lion) is less than 70 mph (cheetah), the lion's maximum speed is lower than the cheetah's.

3. **Consider any relevant factors**:  
   - Speed can vary based on factors like terrain, age, health, or distance (e.g., cheetahs excel in short, explosive chases, while lions are built for endurance). However, in terms of raw top speed, the cheetah consistently outperforms the lion based on general biological data.

4. **Draw a conclusion**:  
   - The question asks if a lion is faster than a cheetah. Based on the comparison, the lion is not faster.

### Final Answer:  
No
