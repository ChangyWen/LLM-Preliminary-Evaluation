*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the wavelength of blue light longer than that of red light?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer as Yes or No.

Recall what I know about light and wavelengths. Light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. The visible spectrum goes from red to violet, with red having the longest wavelength and violet the shortest.

In the rainbow, the order is red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Red is at one end, and violet at the other. Wavelength decreases from red to violet.

So, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light. Therefore, blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light.

The question asks if the wavelength of blue light is longer than that of red light. Based on that, it should be No.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the visible spectrum: The colors are arranged by wavelength, with red having the longest and violet the shortest.

2. Specific wavelengths: Red light is around 620-750 nanometers, while blue light is around 450-495 nanometers.

3. Compare: 450-495 nm (blue) is less than 620-750 nm (red), so blue has a shorter wavelength.

4. Therefore, the wavelength of blue light is not longer than that of red light.

Final answer should be No.

Make sure I'm not confusing it with frequency. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength; blue light has a higher frequency than red light, which is why it has a shorter wavelength.

Yes, I'm confident.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the concept of light and wavelength**: Light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and visible light consists of different colors, each with a specific wavelength. Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks of a wave and is measured in nanometers (nm).

2. **Recall the visible spectrum**: The visible spectrum ranges from approximately 400 nm to 700 nm. Colors are arranged in order of decreasing wavelength: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. This means red light has the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum, and violet has the shortest.

3. **Identify the wavelengths of blue and red light**:
   - Red light typically has wavelengths in the range of 620–750 nm.
   - Blue light typically has wavelengths in the range of 450–495 nm.

4. **Compare the wavelengths**:
   - The wavelength of blue light (450–495 nm) is shorter than the wavelength of red light (620–750 nm).
   - Therefore, blue light does not have a longer wavelength than red light; it has a shorter one.

5. **Conclusion based on the comparison**: The question asks if the wavelength of blue light is longer than that of red light. From the above, this is not the case.

### Final Answer:
No
