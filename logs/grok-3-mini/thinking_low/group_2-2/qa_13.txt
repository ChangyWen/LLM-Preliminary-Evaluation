*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the Berlin Wall longer than the Great Wall of China?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Key facts I know:
- The Great Wall of China is one of the longest structures in the world. It's often cited as being around 21,000 kilometers long, but that's the total length including all branches. The actual built-up wall is shorter.
- More accurately, the Great Wall of China is approximately 21,196 kilometers (about 13,171 miles) in total length, but that's the sum of all sections. The visible or main wall is around 8,850 kilometers.
- The Berlin Wall was a barrier in Berlin, Germany, that divided East and West Berlin. It was built in 1961 and fell in 1989. Its length was much shorter.
- The Berlin Wall was about 155 kilometers (96 miles) long, including the inner and outer walls and the death strip.

I should confirm these lengths:
- Great Wall of China: Official estimates vary, but it's generally accepted as over 20,000 km for the entire system, with the main wall being around 5,500 to 6,000 km of actual wall.
- Upon double-checking my knowledge: The Great Wall is about 21,000 km including all fortifications, but the connected wall is shorter. For comparison, it's vastly longer than the Berlin Wall.
- Berlin Wall: It was 155 km long, but only about 43 km went around West Berlin, with the rest being fences and barriers.

Clearly, the Great Wall of China is much longer than the Berlin Wall.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Recall the lengths:
   - Great Wall of China: Approximately 21,000 km.
   - Berlin Wall: Approximately 155 km.

2. Compare the two: 21,000 km vs. 155 km. 21,000 is greater than 155.

3. Therefore, the Berlin Wall is not longer than the Great Wall of China.

Final answer should be: No.

I need to ensure I'm not missing anything. Is there any way the Berlin Wall could be considered longer? For example, if we include metaphorical or modern extensions, but no, the question is straightforward about the physical walls.

Also, the question says "the Berlin Wall" and "the Great Wall of China," so we're talking about the historical structures.

So, my reasoning process:
- Step 1: Identify the lengths of both walls.
- Step 2: Compare the lengths.
- Step 3: Determine if Berlin Wall > Great Wall of China.
- Conclusion: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the lengths of the walls**:  
   - The Great Wall of China is one of the longest structures ever built. Its total length, including all branches and sections, is approximately 21,000 kilometers (about 13,000 miles). Even the main connected sections are estimated to be around 8,850 kilometers.
   - The Berlin Wall, which divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989, was much shorter. Its total length, including the main wall, fences, and barriers, was about 155 kilometers (around 96 miles).

2. **Compare the lengths**:  
   - Great Wall of China: ~21,000 km (or at least ~8,850 km for the primary structure).  
   - Berlin Wall: ~155 km.  
   - Clearly, 155 km is much less than 21,000 km (or even 8,850 km).

3. **Determine the answer**:  
   - The question asks if the Berlin Wall is longer than the Great Wall of China. Based on the comparison, the Berlin Wall is shorter.

### Final Answer:  
No
