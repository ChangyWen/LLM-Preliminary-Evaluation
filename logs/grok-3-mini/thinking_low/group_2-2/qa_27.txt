*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the boiling point of water lower than the melting point of ice?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer as Yes or No.

Key concepts:
- Boiling point of water: This is the temperature at which water turns from liquid to gas. At standard atmospheric pressure, it's 100°C.
- Melting point of ice: This is the temperature at which ice turns from solid to liquid. At standard atmospheric pressure, it's 0°C.

So, boiling point of water is 100°C, and melting point of ice is 0°C.

Is 100°C lower than 0°C? No, 100°C is higher than 0°C.

The question says "boiling point of water" and "melting point of ice." Water and ice are both H2O, so under the same conditions, the boiling point should be higher than the melting point for any substance.

For water, the phase change points are:
- Melting point (ice to water): 0°C
- Boiling point (water to steam): 100°C

So, clearly, 100°C > 0°C, meaning the boiling point is not lower; it's higher.

Is there any context where this might not be true? For example, at different pressures. But the question doesn't specify, so I assume standard conditions.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the boiling point of water: 100°C at 1 atm.
2. Identify the melting point of ice: 0°C at 1 atm.
3. Compare the two values: Is 100°C < 0°C? No.
4. Therefore, the boiling point is not lower than the melting point.

Final answer should be No.

The question is straightforward: "Is the boiling point of water lower than the melting point of ice?" Based on standard knowledge, it's No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Define the key terms:**
   - The boiling point of water is the temperature at which liquid water turns into vapor (gas). Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), this is 100°C.
   - The melting point of ice is the temperature at which solid ice turns into liquid water. Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), this is 0°C.

2. **Compare the values:**
   - Boiling point of water: 100°C.
   - Melting point of ice: 0°C.
   - Now, determine if 100°C is lower than 0°C. No, 100°C is greater than 0°C.

3. **Consider any conditions:**
   - The question does not specify unusual conditions like high pressure or altitude, so we assume standard conditions (1 atm). Under these conditions, the boiling point is always higher than the melting point for water.

4. **Conclusion based on comparison:**
   - Since the boiling point (100°C) is not lower than the melting point (0°C), the statement is false.

### Final Answer:
No
