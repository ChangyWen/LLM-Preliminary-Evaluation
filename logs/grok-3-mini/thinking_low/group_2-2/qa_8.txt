First, the question is: "Is the Gobi Desert hotter than the Sahara Desert?" I need to provide a step-by-step reasoning process and end with a final answer of "Yes" or "No."

Key elements: Compare the temperatures of the Gobi Desert and the Sahara Desert. Determine which one is hotter.

Recall what I know about these deserts:

- The Sahara Desert is in North Africa. It's the largest hot desert in the world and known for its extreme heat. It has very high temperatures, especially in summer.

- The Gobi Desert is in Asia, between China and Mongolia. It's a cold desert, meaning it experiences both hot summers and very cold winters. It's not as uniformly hot as the Sahara.

Temperature comparisons:

- Sahara: Average high temperatures can reach up to 50°C (122°F) in summer. It's one of the hottest places on Earth.

- Gobi: Summers can be hot, with temperatures up to 40°C (104°F), but winters are extremely cold, dropping below -40°C (-40°F). So, overall, it's not as hot year-round.

The question is about which is hotter, but it doesn't specify if it's average temperature, summer highs, or what. Generally, when we say a desert is hotter, we mean its peak or average high temperatures.

From reliable sources:

- The highest recorded temperature in the Sahara is around 58°C (136°F) in places like Death Valley, but Death Valley is in the US, not Sahara. Wait, no, the Sahara has records up to 57.7°C in 'Aziziya, Libya, though that might be disputed.

- For the Gobi, the highest temperatures are lower, around 40-45°C.

So, based on that, the Sahara has higher temperatures.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the deserts:** Gobi Desert (Asia) and Sahara Desert (Africa).

2. **Understand their climates:**
   - Sahara: Hot desert climate. Extremely high temperatures in summer, low humidity.
   - Gobi: Cold desert climate. Hot summers but very cold winters.

3. **Compare average temperatures:**
   - Sahara: Average summer highs: 40-50°C.
   - Gobi: Average summer highs: 25-40°C, but with significant drops in winter.

4. **Compare record highs:**
   - Sahara: Highest recorded: about 58°C (disputed, but high).
   - Gobi: Highest recorded: around 45°C or less.

5. **Consider overall heat:** The Sahara is generally considered the hottest desert due to its consistent high temperatures, while the Gobi has a more temperate range.

6. **Conclusion:** Based on this, the Sahara is hotter than the Gobi Desert.

Final answer should be "No," because the Gobi is not hotter than the Sahara.

The question is: "Is the Gobi Desert hotter than the Sahara Desert?" If Sahara is hotter, then the answer is No.

Make sure my reasoning is accurate. I should base this on general knowledge, as I'm an AI trained on data up to 2023.

Yes, I think that's correct.

Below is my step-by-step reasoning process to answer the question: "Is the Gobi Desert hotter than the Sahara Desert?" I'll base this on established geographical and climatic data from reliable sources, such as meteorological records and climate studies.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the deserts and their locations:**
   - The Gobi Desert is located in Asia, primarily in northern China and southern Mongolia. It is classified as a cold desert, meaning it experiences significant seasonal temperature variations, with hot summers and extremely cold winters.
   - The Sahara Desert is located in North Africa and is the world's largest hot desert. It is known for its arid, consistently high temperatures, especially during the summer months.

2. **Examine the climate types:**
   - The Sahara has a hyper-arid climate with very high temperatures year-round, particularly in summer. It is one of the hottest places on Earth due to its low latitude (near the equator), clear skies, and minimal vegetation or water bodies to moderate heat.
   - The Gobi has a cold desert climate (BWk in the Köppen classification), where summers can be warm but winters are bitterly cold. This makes its overall temperature profile less extreme in terms of sustained heat compared to hot deserts like the Sahara.

3. **Compare average temperatures:**
   - **Sahara Desert:** Average summer highs range from 40°C to 50°C (104°F to 122°F) in many areas, with some regions exceeding 50°C. The annual average temperature is around 30°C (86°F).
   - **Gobi Desert:** Average summer highs range from 25°C to 40°C (77°F to 104°F), but the annual average is much lower, around 5°C to 15°C (41°F to 59°F), due to harsh winters where temperatures can drop below -40°C (-40°F).

4. **Compare record high temperatures:**
   - **Sahara Desert:** The highest recorded temperature in the Sahara is approximately 57.7°C (135.9°F) in 'Aziziya, Libya (though this record is sometimes disputed). Other areas, like Death Valley in the broader context of hot deserts, have seen similar extremes, but the Sahara itself is renowned for its heat records.
   - **Gobi Desert:** The highest recorded temperature is around 45°C (113°F) in some areas during summer. This is significantly lower than the Sahara's peaks.

5. **Consider other factors influencing heat:**
   - The Sahara's proximity to the equator and its vast sandy expanses absorb and retain heat efficiently, leading to higher and more consistent temperatures.
   - The Gobi's higher elevation (much of it is above 1,000 meters) and its continental location result in greater temperature fluctuations, including cold winters, which prevent it from being classified as a "hot desert."

6. **Determine overall heat comparison:**
   - Based on average highs, record temperatures, and climatic classifications, the Sahara consistently experiences higher temperatures than the Gobi. While the Gobi can get hot in summer, it does not surpass the Sahara in terms of peak or sustained heat.

### Final Answer:
No
