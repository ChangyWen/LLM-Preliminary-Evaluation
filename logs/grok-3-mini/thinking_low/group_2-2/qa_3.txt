*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?" I need to compare the death years of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein.

Recall the key dates:

- Isaac Newton was born in 1643 and died in 1727.

- Albert Einstein was born in 1879 and died in 1955.

Newton died in 1727, and Einstein died in 1955. So, 1955 is later than 1727.

The question is whether Newton died later than Einstein. That means, is Newton's death date after Einstein's death date?

Newton died in 1727, Einstein in 1955. 1727 is before 1955, so Newton died earlier than Einstein.

The question says: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?" So, if Newton died in 1727 and Einstein in 1955, Newton did not die later; he died earlier.

To confirm:

- Einstein died in 1955.

- Newton died in 1727.

Is 1727 later than 1955? No, 1727 is earlier.

Therefore, the answer should be No.

Now, the user asked for a step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No).

So, structure my response:

1. State the death years.

2. Compare them.

3. Conclude with Yes or No.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- First, recall or state the death year of Isaac Newton: 1727.

- Second, recall or state the death year of Albert Einstein: 1955.

- Third, Compare the two dates: Is 1727 later than 1955? No, 1727 is before 1955.

- Therefore, Newton did not die later than Einstein; he died earlier.

Final answer: No.

Make sure this is accurate. I don't think there's any trick here, like different calendars or something, but for historical figures like this, the dates are standard.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the death year of Isaac Newton**: Isaac Newton, the famous physicist and mathematician, was born in 1643 and died on March 31, 1727.

2. **Identify the death year of Albert Einstein**: Albert Einstein, the renowned theoretical physicist, was born in 1879 and died on April 18, 1955.

3. **Compare the death years**: To determine if Newton died later than Einstein, we compare the dates:
   - Newton's death: 1727
   - Einstein's death: 1955
   - 1727 is earlier than 1955, as 1727 comes before 1955 on the timeline.

4. **Evaluate the question**: The question asks if Newton's death occurred later than Einstein's. Since 1727 is before 1955, Newton did not die later than Einstein; he died earlier.

### Final Answer:
No
