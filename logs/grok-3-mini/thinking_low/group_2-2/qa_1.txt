*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is an elephant heavier than a blue whale?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Key facts I know:
- Elephants are the largest land animals.
- Blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, and they live in the ocean.
- Blue whales can weigh up to 200 tons or more.
- The largest elephants, like African elephants, weigh up to about 6 to 7 tons.

Let me verify those weights:
- An adult male African elephant can weigh between 4,000 to 7,000 kilograms, which is 4 to 7 metric tons.
- A blue whale can weigh up to 150 to 200 metric tons. Some sources say the largest blue whales can reach over 190 tons.

So, clearly, a blue whale is much heavier than an elephant.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Compare the weights of the two animals.
2. State the approximate weights.
3. Determine which one is heavier.
4. Conclude with Yes or No.

Step 1: Identify the weights.
   - Average weight of an elephant: Let's say an African bush elephant, the largest, weighs up to 6,000 kg (6 tons).
   - Average weight of a blue whale: Up to 150,000 kg (150 tons) or more.

Step 2: Compare the numbers.
   - 6 tons vs. 150 tons.
   - 150 tons is 25 times heavier than 6 tons.

Step 3: Based on this, the elephant is not heavier than the blue whale.

Step 4: Final answer should be No.

I should ensure I'm not missing anything. Is there any context where an elephant could be heavier? For example, if we're talking about a baby blue whale, but the question doesn't specify; it just says "a blue whale," which implies a typical adult one.

The question is straightforward: Is an elephant heavier than a blue whale? In general, no.

Make sure my response is clear and follows the instruction: Show step-by-step reasoning and end with Yes or No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the animals and their typical weights**: 
   - An elephant refers to the largest land animal, such as the African bush elephant. The average weight of an adult male African elephant is about 4,000 to 7,000 kilograms (4 to 7 metric tons).
   - A blue whale is the largest animal on Earth. Adult blue whales can weigh between 100,000 to 200,000 kilograms (100 to 200 metric tons), with some individuals reaching even higher.

2. **Compare the weights**:
   - The heaviest elephant weighs around 7 metric tons.
   - The lightest adult blue whale weighs around 100 metric tons.
   - Even the smallest adult blue whales are significantly heavier than the largest elephants, as 100 metric tons is more than 14 times the weight of a 7-ton elephant.

3. **Consider any exceptions**:
   - If we were comparing a newborn blue whale or a very small elephant, the weights might be closer, but the question doesn't specify these cases. It asks about "an elephant" and "a blue whale," which generally implies typical adults.
   - In general terms, no elephant species comes close to the weight of an adult blue whale.

4. **Draw a conclusion**:
   - Based on the weight comparisons, an elephant is not heavier than a blue whale.

### Final Answer: No
