*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?" I need to provide a step-by-step reasoning process and end with a final answer of "Yes" or "No."

I know from general knowledge that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world. Its height is approximately 8,848 meters above sea level. K2 is the second tallest mountain, with a height of about 8,611 meters.

Let me double-check those figures. Yes, Mount Everest is 8,848 meters, and K2 is 8,611 meters. So, clearly, Everest is taller.

The question is about height, which typically means elevation above sea level. So, based on that, K2 is not taller than Everest.

Is there any context where K2 could be considered taller? For example, if we're talking about prominence or from base to peak, but the standard measure is height above sea level.

K2 is in the Karakoram range, and it's known for being more difficult to climb than Everest, but that doesn't affect its height.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall the heights of the mountains.

   - Mount Everest: 8,848 meters.

   - K2: 8,611 meters.

2. Compare the two heights.

   - 8,848 meters > 8,611 meters.

3. Therefore, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

4. The answer should be "No," because K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.

I should ensure my facts are accurate. Upon a quick mental check, yes, those are the standard accepted heights. There might be slight variations due to measurements, but Everest is definitively taller.

Finally, structure my response as requested: step-by-step reasoning and then the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the heights of the mountains**:  
   From reliable geographical data, Mount Everest has an elevation of approximately 8,848 meters above sea level. K2, on the other hand, has an elevation of approximately 8,611 meters above sea level.

2. **Understand the definition of "taller"**:  
   In this context, "taller" refers to the elevation above sea level, which is the standard measure for comparing mountain heights.

3. **Compare the heights**:  
   - Mount Everest: 8,848 meters  
   - K2: 8,611 meters  
   Since 8,848 meters is greater than 8,611 meters, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

4. **Consider any exceptions or alternative measures**:  
   While K2 might be considered more challenging to climb or have a greater prominence in some contexts (e.g., from base to peak), the question specifically asks about height, which is based on elevation above sea level. No alternative measure changes the fact that Everest is taller.

5. **Conclude based on the comparison**:  
   Based on the standard and widely accepted measurements, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.

### Final Answer:  
No
