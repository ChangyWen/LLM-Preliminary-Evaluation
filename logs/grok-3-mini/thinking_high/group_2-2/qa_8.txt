*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the Gobi Desert hotter than the Sahara Desert?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I should recall what I know about these deserts. The Sahara Desert is in Africa and is known as one of the hottest deserts in the world. The Gobi Desert is in Asia, between China and Mongolia, and I think it's colder, but I'm not sure.

To compare their temperatures, I need to think about average temperatures or peak temperatures. Deserts can have extreme variations, so I should consider both high and low temperatures, but the question is about being "hotter," so probably focusing on the highest temperatures or average high temperatures.

Let me recall some facts:

- Sahara Desert: It's famous for high temperatures. I think the highest recorded temperature on Earth was in the Sahara, in Libya, at 57.8°C (136°F) in 1922, but that might be disputed. Generally, it's very hot.

- Gobi Desert: I believe it's a cold desert. It's in a higher latitude and has a continental climate, so it gets very cold in winter and might not be as hot in summer. I think the average high in summer might be around 40°C, but I'm not sure.

I should think about average annual temperatures or summer highs.

From what I remember:

- Sahara: Average high temperatures in summer can reach 40-50°C in many areas. It's arid and receives a lot of sunlight.

- Gobi: It's known for its cold winters, with temperatures dropping below -40°C. In summer, it can get hot, but probably not as hot as the Sahara. I think summer highs in the Gobi are around 25-40°C, but I need to confirm.

I don't have exact numbers, so I should reason based on general knowledge.

Factors that affect temperature:

- Latitude: Sahara is closer to the equator (around 15-30°N), so it gets more direct sunlight. Gobi is farther north (around 40-45°N), so less direct sunlight, leading to cooler temperatures.

- Altitude: Gobi is at a higher elevation in some parts, which can make it cooler. Sahara has varying elevations, but much of it is low-lying.

- Climate type: Sahara is a hot desert climate, while Gobi is a cold desert or steppe climate.

I think the Gobi is classified as a cold desert because of its winter temperatures, whereas Sahara is a hot desert.

Now, to answer if Gobi is hotter: Probably not, because the Sahara is renowned for its extreme heat.

But let's think about specific records.

Highest temperature recorded:

- Sahara: As I said, around 57.8°C in Libya.

- Gobi: I don't think it has such high records. Probably the highest in Gobi is lower.

Average temperatures:

- Sahara: Average high in July (peak summer) can be 40-45°C in many areas.

- Gobi: Average high in July might be 25-30°C in some parts, but could be higher in the lowest areas. I think in the Turpan Depression in China, which is near the Gobi, temperatures can reach 50°C, but is that part of the Gobi?

The Gobi Desert includes areas like the Taklamakan, but typically, Gobi refers to the desert in Mongolia and China. The highest temperatures in that region might not be as high.

Upon second thought, the hottest part of China is the Turpan Basin, which can have temperatures over 50°C, and it's sometimes associated with the Gobi, but technically, Gobi is more central.

To be precise, I should consider the core areas.

Generally, the Sahara is considered hotter.

I can think about why the question might be tricky. Sometimes people might think of average annual temperature, where Gobi could be colder overall.

But the question is "hotter," which implies comparison of heat, so likely maximum or high temperatures.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify key characteristics: Sahara is a hot desert, Gobi is a cold desert.

2. Compare latitudes: Sahara is lower latitude, so hotter.

3. Recall temperature extremes: Sahara has higher recorded highs.

4. Conclusion: Likely, Sahara is hotter.

Final answer should be No, the Gobi is not hotter than the Sahara.

The question is "Is the Gobi Desert hotter than the Sahara Desert?" So if Sahara is hotter, answer is No.

But to be thorough, is there any metric where Gobi could be hotter? For example, if we consider night temperatures or something, but that doesn't make sense for "hotter."

No, I think it's clear.

So, my answer is No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The query asks whether the Gobi Desert is hotter than the Sahara Desert. "Hotter" typically refers to higher temperatures, so I need to compare key temperature metrics, such as average high temperatures, peak recorded temperatures, and general climate characteristics.

2. **Key Characteristics of the Deserts**:
   - **Sahara Desert**: Located in North Africa, it is one of the largest hot deserts in the world. It has a subtropical climate with extremely high temperatures due to its proximity to the equator (latitudes 15-30°N), low elevation in many areas, and minimal cloud cover, leading to intense solar heating.
   - **Gobi Desert**: Located in Asia (spanning parts of Mongolia and China), it is classified as a cold desert. It has a continental climate with significant temperature variations, influenced by its higher latitude (around 40-45°N) and higher elevation in some regions, which results in colder winters and milder summers compared to hot deserts.

3. **Compare Temperature Metrics**:
   - **Average High Temperatures**:
     - Sahara: Summer average highs often range from 40-50°C (104-122°F) in many areas, with some regions exceeding this. For example, in July, temperatures can commonly reach 45°C (113°F).
     - Gobi: Summer average highs are generally lower, typically ranging from 25-40°C (77-104°F), with most areas averaging around 30°C (86°F) in July. The Gobi's climate is moderated by its latitude and elevation, preventing it from reaching the extremes of hot deserts.
   - **Peak Recorded Temperatures**:
     - Sahara: The highest recorded temperature on Earth was in the Sahara (in Libya's Al Azizia, though disputed, around 57.8°C or 136°F in 1922). Even with the dispute, reliable highs in the Sahara often exceed 50°C (122°F).
     - Gobi: The highest recorded temperatures in the Gobi are much lower. For instance, in extreme cases, temperatures might reach 45°C (113°F) in specific low-lying areas like parts of the Turpan Depression (which is sometimes associated with the Gobi region), but this is not typical for the core Gobi Desert. Most records are below 40°C (104°F).
   - **Annual Temperature Range**:
     - Sahara: Consistently hot year-round, with minimal seasonal variation, as it rarely experiences freezing temperatures.
     - Gobi: Experiences extreme seasonal swings, with summer highs possibly reaching 35-40°C (95-104°F) but winter lows dropping below -40°C (-40°F). This makes the Gobi colder overall on an annual basis.

4. **Factors Influencing Temperature**:
   - **Latitude**: The Sahara's lower latitude means it receives more direct sunlight and higher solar radiation, making it hotter. The Gobi's higher latitude results in less intense sunlight and cooler conditions.
   - **Elevation**: Parts of the Gobi are at higher elevations (e.g., up to 1,500 meters or more), which cools temperatures. The Sahara has varied elevation but includes large low-lying areas that amplify heat.
   - **Climate Classification**: The Sahara is a classic "hot desert" (BWh in the Köppen climate system), while the Gobi is often classified as a "cold desert" or steppe (BWk), indicating its colder tendencies.

5. **Overall Comparison**:
   - Based on average highs, peak records, and climate data, the Sahara consistently shows higher temperatures than the Gobi. While the Gobi can get hot in summer, it does not approach the extreme heat of the Sahara. The Gobi is better known for its cold winters, which further emphasizes that it is not a "hot" desert in the same way.

6. **Conclusion**: After comparing the available data and characteristics, the Gobi Desert is not hotter than the Sahara Desert. The Sahara's higher temperatures across various metrics make it one of the hottest places on Earth, while the Gobi is comparatively milder in its heat extremes.

### Final Answer: No
