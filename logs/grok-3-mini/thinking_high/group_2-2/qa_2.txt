First, the question is: "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, but I should confirm the heights to be accurate. From my knowledge, Mount Everest's height is approximately 8,848 meters above sea level. Now, what about K2? I think K2 is the second-highest mountain, so it should be shorter, but I need to recall its height.

I believe K2's height is around 8,611 meters. Let me make sure. Yes, that's what I remember: Everest is 8,848 m, and K2 is 8,611 m. So, comparing the two, 8,848 is greater than 8,611, which means Everest is taller.

But the question is about height, which typically refers to elevation above sea level. So, based on that, K2 is not taller than Everest.

I should consider if there's any context where K2 could be considered taller. For example, sometimes people talk about prominence or other metrics, but the standard comparison is based on elevation above sea level.

Also, I recall that there was a slight adjustment to Everest's height in 2020, when Nepal and China agreed on 8,848.86 meters, but it's still around 8,848 m. K2's height is consistently reported as 8,611 m.

Let me double-check my memory: Everest: 8,848 m, K2: 8,611 m. Difference is about 237 meters, so Everest is taller.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall the standard heights: Mount Everest is 8,848 meters, K2 is 8,611 meters.

2. Compare the two numbers: 8,848 > 8,611.

3. Therefore, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

4. The answer should be No, K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.

The question is "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?" So, if Everest is taller, the answer is No.

I should make sure there's no trick here. Is there any way K2 could be taller? For instance, if we're talking about height from base to peak, but K2 is not on a plateau like some mountains; it's still measured from sea level. Mauna Kea is taller from base to peak, but that's not the standard metric for "taller" in mountain comparisons.

In standard geographical terms, height refers to elevation above sea level, so Everest wins.

Final answer: No.

I need to box it as per the instruction. So, the final answer is No.

To answer the question "Is K2 taller than Mount Everest?", I'll reason step by step based on standard geographical measurements of height, which refer to elevation above sea level.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the heights of the mountains**:  
   - Mount Everest's height is approximately 8,848 meters above sea level (based on the most widely accepted measurement, with a slight update in 2020 to 8,848.86 meters by Nepal and China, but for simplicity, we use 8,848 meters).  
   - K2's height is approximately 8,611 meters above sea level (this is a consistent figure from reliable sources like the United States Geological Survey and other geographical databases).  

2. **Compare the heights**:  
   - Mount Everest: 8,848 meters.  
   - K2: 8,611 meters.  
   - Performing a direct numerical comparison: 8,848 > 8,611. This means Mount Everest is taller than K2 by about 237 meters.  

3. **Consider the definition of "taller"**:  
   - In standard terms, when comparing mountain heights, "taller" refers to elevation above sea level. While other metrics like prominence (how much a mountain rises above its surroundings) or base-to-peak height exist, the question does not specify these. Therefore, we stick to the conventional sea-level elevation comparison.  
   - K2 is often noted as the second-highest mountain in the world by elevation, which supports that it is shorter than Everest.  

4. **Address potential edge cases**:  
   - There are no widely recognized scenarios or alternative measurements (e.g., from different reference points) where K2 would be considered taller than Mount Everest. For example:  
     - If we were discussing base-to-peak height (which considers the mountain's full rise from its base, even if underwater), Mauna Kea in Hawaii would be taller, but K2 is still not comparable in that metric to exceed Everest's sea-level height.  
     - No recent surveys or disputes have changed the fact that Everest is the highest by sea-level elevation.  

5. **Conclusion based on the comparison**:  
   - Since K2's height (8,611 meters) is less than Mount Everest's height (8,848 meters), K2 is not taller than Mount Everest.  

### Final Answer:  
No
