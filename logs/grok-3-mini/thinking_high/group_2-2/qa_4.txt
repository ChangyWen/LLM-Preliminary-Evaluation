*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Does Canada have a larger population than the United States?" I need to answer with a simple Yes or No, but also show my step-by-step reasoning.

I know that the United States has a much larger population than Canada. The US is one of the most populous countries in the world, while Canada is less populated despite its large land area.

Recall some approximate population figures. The US population is around 330 million people. Canada has about 38 million people. These are rough estimates, but they should be sufficient for this comparison.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Compare known populations:**
   - United States: Approximately 331 million (as of recent years).
   - Canada: Approximately 38 million (as of recent years).

2. **Perform a simple comparison:**
   - Is 38 million greater than 331 million? No, clearly not.

3. **Consider if there's any recent change:** Populations can change, but the difference is so large that even with growth, Canada wouldn't surpass the US in the near term. For example, Canada's population growth is steady but not dramatic enough to close such a gap.

4. **Reliable sources:** I should base this on general knowledge. From memory, the US is the third most populous country in the world (after China and India), while Canada is around 38th or so. This reinforces that the US has a larger population.

5. **Edge cases:** Is there any scenario where this might not be true? Like if we're talking about a specific region or time period, but the question seems straightforward and general, so I'll assume it's about current overall populations.

6. **Final decision:** Based on this, the answer should be No.

Now, for the response format: I need to show step-by-step reasoning and end with a clear Yes or No. So, I'll structure my answer accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Recall approximate population figures:** Based on general knowledge and recent estimates, the population of the United States is approximately 331 million people (as of 2023 data from sources like the U.S. Census Bureau). The population of Canada is approximately 38 million people (as of 2023 data from sources like Statistics Canada).

2. **Compare the numbers:** To determine if Canada has a larger population, I compare 38 million (Canada) to 331 million (United States). Clearly, 38 million is less than 331 million.

3. **Consider population trends:** While both countries experience population growth, the United States has a much larger base population and higher overall growth rate due to factors like immigration and birth rates. There is no indication from recent trends that Canada could surpass the United States in population in the foreseeable future.

4. **Account for data reliability:** These figures are based on widely accepted sources and are subject to minor fluctuations, but the difference is so significant (over 8 times larger) that it wouldn't change the outcome even with small adjustments.

5. **Conclusion from comparison:** Canada does not have a larger population than the United States.

### Final Answer: No
