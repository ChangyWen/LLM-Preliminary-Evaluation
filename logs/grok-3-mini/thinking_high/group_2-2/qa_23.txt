*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. It's based on the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). Lower pH means more acidic, higher pH means more basic. Pure water has a pH of 7, which is neutral.

Lemon juice is acidic because it contains citric acid. So, it should have a pH lower than 7. I think lemon juice has a pH around 2 or 3. Yeah, typically, lemon juice pH is about 2.2 to 2.4.

Water is neutral at pH 7, and lemon juice is acidic with pH around 2-3. So, if lemon juice has a lower pH than water, then the answer should be No, because the question is asking if water's pH is lower than lemon juice's.

Let me read the question again: "Is the pH of water lower than that of lemon juice?" So, is pH_water < pH_lemon juice?

pH_water = 7

pH_lemon juice ≈ 2.3 (let's say)

7 is greater than 2.3, so pH_water is not lower; it's higher. Therefore, the answer should be No.

But I should confirm the pH values. Pure water is exactly 7 at 25°C. Lemon juice: yes, it's acidic. Common knowledge is that citrus fruits have low pH. For example, orange juice is around 3.5, lemon is more acidic, so 2-3 is correct.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Define pH: pH measures acidity; lower pH is more acidic.

2. pH of pure water: 7 (neutral).

3. pH of lemon juice: acidic, typically 2-3.

4. Compare: Is 7 < 2-3? No, 7 is greater than 2-3.

5. Therefore, the pH of water is not lower than that of lemon juice.

The question is clear: "lower than", meaning less than.

Also, is there any trick? Like, is the water specified? It just says "water", so I assume pure water. Lemon juice is straightforward.

Final answer should be No.

But let me make sure about the pH of lemon juice. Upon quick recall, yes, it's low. Even if I'm slightly off, say lemon juice pH is 3, water is 7, still 7 > 3.

No chance that lemon juice could have higher pH; it's always acidic.

So, I'm confident.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand pH**: pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution, based on the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). A lower pH indicates a more acidic solution, while a higher pH indicates a more basic (or alkaline) solution. A pH of 7 is neutral.

2. **pH of water**: Pure water at 25°C has a pH of exactly 7, as it is neutral and not acidic or basic.

3. **pH of lemon juice**: Lemon juice is acidic due to the presence of citric acid and other organic acids. Its pH typically ranges from about 2.0 to 2.4, depending on factors like concentration and ripeness. For this comparison, we can use an approximate value of 2.2–2.4.

4. **Compare the pH values**: 
   - pH of water = 7
   - pH of lemon juice ≈ 2.2–2.4
   - The question asks if the pH of water is lower than that of lemon juice, which means we need to check if 7 < 2.2–2.4.
   - Numerically, 7 is greater than 2.2–2.4, so the pH of water is not lower; it is higher.

5. **Conclusion**: Since the pH of water (7) is higher than the pH of lemon juice (approximately 2.2–2.4), the statement "the pH of water is lower than that of lemon juice" is false.

### Final Answer: No
