*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is China located east of Japan?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

Step 1: Understand the geographical positions of China and Japan.

- Japan is an island nation in East Asia. It's known for being in the Pacific Ocean, and its main islands are east of the Asian mainland.

- China is a large country in East Asia, occupying much of the eastern part of the Asian continent. It's on the mainland.

Step 2: Recall the relative positions.

- If I think about a map of Asia, China is on the west side of the Pacific Ocean, while Japan is further east, in the ocean.

- Specifically, Japan is east of China. For example, cities like Tokyo in Japan are east of Beijing in China.

Step 3: Consider directions.

- East means to the right on a standard map where north is up.

- Starting from China, moving east would take you across the East China Sea to Japan.

- The East China Sea is between China and Japan, so Japan is indeed east of China.

Step 4: Double-check with known facts.

- I know that Japan is often described as being east of China. For instance, in historical contexts, Japan is referred to as the "Land of the Rising Sun," which implies it's further east.

- Longitude lines: China spans roughly from about 75°E to 135°E longitude. Japan is around 130°E to 145°E. So, parts of Japan are east of China, but some parts might overlap in longitude.

- China's easternmost point is around 135°E (e.g., Heilongjiang province), and Japan's westernmost point is around 122°E (Okinawa). Actually, Japan's westernmost island is closer to 123°E, and China's eastern coast is around 120°E to 135°E.

- More accurately:

  - China's longitude: Westernmost is about 73°E, easternmost is about 135°E.

  - Japan's longitude: Westernmost is about 123°E (Yonaguni Island), easternmost is about 146°E.

  - So, comparing the mainlands: China's east coast (e.g., Shanghai at 121°E) and Japan's west (e.g., Kyushu at around 130°E). Kyushu is east of Shanghai.

  - Generally, Japan is located to the east of China.

Step 5: Consider the question: "Is China located east of Japan?"

- The question is asking if China is east of Japan, not the other way around.

- From what I recall, Japan is east of China, so China should be west of Japan.

- Therefore, China is not east of Japan; it's west.

Step 6: Confirm with a mental map.

- If I'm in Japan, looking west, I see China across the sea. So, China is to the west of Japan.

- Hence, China is not east of Japan.

Step 7: Final reasoning.

- The relative position: Japan is east of China, so China is west of Japan.

- Answer should be No, China is not located east of Japan.

Step 8: Ensure the answer format.

- The question asks for a Yes or No answer, and to show step-by-step reasoning.

- My final answer is No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the geographical context**: China and Japan are both located in East Asia. China is a large continental country, while Japan is an island nation in the Pacific Ocean.

2. **Recall relative positions**: 
   - Japan is situated to the east of the Asian mainland, separated from China by the East China Sea.
   - China occupies a vast area on the mainland, with its eastern coast facing the Pacific Ocean.

3. **Analyze directions**:
   - On a standard map (with north at the top), moving east from China would cross the East China Sea and reach Japan. This indicates that Japan is east of China.
   - Conversely, if we consider the direction from Japan, China is located to the west across the sea.

4. **Consider longitude for precision**:
   - China's longitude ranges approximately from 73°E (western border) to 135°E (easternmost point).
   - Japan's longitude ranges from about 123°E (westernmost island, e.g., Yonaguni) to 146°E (easternmost point).
   - Comparing key points, such as Shanghai in China (around 121°E) and Kyushu in Japan (around 130°E–131°E), Japan is generally east of China. This means China is west of Japan, not east.

5. **Address the specific question**: The query asks if China is located east of Japan. Based on the above, China is not east of Japan; instead, it is west of Japan.

6. **Conclusion from reasoning**: All evidence from geography, maps, and longitude data confirms that China is not east of Japan.

### Final Answer: No
