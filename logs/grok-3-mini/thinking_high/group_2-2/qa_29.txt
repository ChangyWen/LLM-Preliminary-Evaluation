First, the question is: "Is the wavelength of blue light longer than that of red light?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. The visible light spectrum goes from red to violet, with red having the longest wavelength and violet the shortest.

Red light has a longer wavelength, and blue light is closer to violet, so it should have a shorter wavelength.

Recall the approximate wavelengths: red light is around 650 nanometers, and blue light is around 450 nanometers. So, 650 nm is longer than 450 nm, which means red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

The question is asking if blue light's wavelength is longer than red light's. Based on that, it should be no, because blue has a shorter wavelength.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the visible light spectrum: It ranges from approximately 400 nm to 700 nm.

2. Red light is at the higher end, around 620-750 nm, so longer wavelengths.

3. Blue light is at the lower end, around 450-495 nm, so shorter wavelengths.

4. Therefore, wavelength of blue light (shorter) is not longer than that of red light (longer).

5. So, the answer should be No.

I should make sure there's no trick here. Is there any context where blue light could have a longer wavelength? For example, in different mediums or something? But the question seems to be about standard visible light in vacuum or air, I assume.

Also, confirm the colors: Blue is indeed shorter wavelength than red. In the rainbow, ROYGBIV, red is first, violet last, with blue in between but still shorter than red.

Final answer: No.

The question says "show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)." So I need to present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the visible light spectrum**: Light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and visible light ranges from approximately 400 nanometers (nm) to 700 nm. Different colors correspond to different wavelengths, with red light having longer wavelengths and violet light having shorter wavelengths.

2. **Identify the wavelengths of red and blue light**:
   - Red light typically has wavelengths around 620–750 nm.
   - Blue light typically has wavelengths around 450–495 nm.

3. **Compare the wavelengths**:
   - Red light's wavelength (e.g., 650 nm) is longer than blue light's wavelength (e.g., 450 nm).
   - In the visible spectrum, as you move from red to violet (ROYGBIV order), the wavelength decreases. Blue light is closer to violet, so it has a shorter wavelength than red light.

4. **Answer the specific question**: The query asks if the wavelength of blue light is longer than that of red light. Based on the comparison, blue light's wavelength is shorter, not longer.

5. **Consider any exceptions**: In standard conditions (e.g., in a vacuum or air), this relationship holds true. There are no common scenarios where blue light would have a longer wavelength than red light in the context of visible light.

### Final Answer: No
