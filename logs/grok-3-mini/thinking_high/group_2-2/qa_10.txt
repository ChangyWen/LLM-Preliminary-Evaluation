First, the question is: "Is silver more expensive than gold?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Step 1: Understand the question. It's asking about the price comparison between silver and gold. Typically, when we talk about expense, we mean the market price per unit, like per ounce or per gram.

Step 2: Recall general knowledge. From what I know, gold is generally more expensive than silver. Gold is considered a precious metal with higher value due to its rarity, uses in jewelry, investment, and industry. Silver is also precious but more abundant, so it's usually cheaper.

Step 3: Think about current market prices. As an AI, I should base my answer on general trends, but I can reference typical values. For example, as of my last knowledge update, gold is around $2,000 per ounce, and silver is around $25 per ounce. That means gold is more expensive.

Step 4: Consider if there are any scenarios where silver could be more expensive. Historically, silver has never been consistently more expensive than gold. The gold-to-silver ratio is usually around 50:1 or higher, meaning it takes many ounces of silver to equal the value of one ounce of gold. For instance, if gold is $2,000/oz and silver is $40/oz, the ratio is 50:1, so gold is still more valuable.

Step 5: Check for any exceptions. In some rare cases, due to market fluctuations, the price could temporarily change, but overall, gold is more expensive. The question seems to be asking in a general sense, not specifying a time or condition.

Step 6: Base the answer on facts. I should not make up data. From reliable sources like the World Gold Council or commodity exchanges, gold prices are higher than silver prices per ounce.

Step 7: Step-by-step reasoning summary:
- Gold is rarer than silver.
- Gold has higher industrial and investment demand.
- Historical and current market data show gold is more expensive.
- Therefore, silver is not more expensive than gold.

Step 8: Final answer should be No, because silver is not more expensive than gold.

Step 9: Ensure the answer format is correct. The user asked for "Yes or No" and step-by-step reasoning, which I've done.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the question**: The query asks whether silver is more expensive than gold, which typically refers to their market prices per unit (e.g., per ounce or per gram). Expense is determined by factors like rarity, demand, supply, and historical pricing trends.

2. **Recall general knowledge**: Gold and silver are both precious metals, but gold is generally rarer and has higher demand for uses in jewelry, investment, electronics, and as a store of value. Silver is more abundant and often used in industrial applications, coins, and jewelry, but it is typically less valuable per unit.

3. **Consider market prices**: Based on historical and current trends (as of my last knowledge update in 2023), gold prices are usually much higher than silver prices. For example:
   - Gold often trades around $1,800–$2,500 per troy ounce.
   - Silver typically trades around $20–$30 per troy ounce.
   - This results in a gold-to-silver ratio of about 50:1 or higher, meaning it takes many ounces of silver to match the value of one ounce of gold.

4. **Examine factors influencing price**:
   - **Rarity and supply**: Gold is scarcer in the Earth's crust, making it more valuable. Silver is more plentiful, which keeps its price lower.
   - **Demand**: Gold is often seen as a "safe-haven" asset during economic uncertainty, while silver's demand is more tied to industrial uses (e.g., electronics, solar panels), which can fluctuate but rarely push its price above gold's.
   - **Historical context**: Over centuries, gold has consistently been more expensive than silver. There have been short-term fluctuations (e.g., during market volatility), but silver has never been more expensive than gold on a sustained basis.

5. **Check for exceptions**: In rare cases, such as extreme market conditions (e.g., a silver shortage or gold price crash), silver could theoretically be more expensive temporarily. However, this is not the norm, and based on long-term data, gold remains more expensive.

6. **Conclusion based on evidence**: Drawing from economic data, commodity markets, and general trends, silver is not more expensive than gold in most contexts. The question appears to ask about a general comparison, so I'll base the answer on typical conditions.

### Final Answer: No
