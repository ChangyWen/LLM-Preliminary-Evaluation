*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the average lifespan of a dog longer than that of a human?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Step 1: Understand the key terms. Average lifespan means the typical length of life for dogs and humans. I need to recall or know what these averages are.

Step 2: Recall average lifespans. For humans, the average lifespan is around 70-80 years, depending on the country. For example, in developed countries, it's about 70-85 years. I'll use a general average. Let's say approximately 72 years globally, but it's higher in many places. I should use a standard figure. According to WHO or common knowledge, human average lifespan is around 73 years worldwide, but it varies.

For dogs, the average lifespan depends on the breed. Small dogs live longer, like 15-20 years, while large dogs might live 8-10 years. So, the average across all breeds might be around 10-13 years. I think a common figure is that the average dog lives about 10-12 years.

Step 3: Compare the two. Human average: let's say 70-80 years. Dog average: 10-13 years. Clearly, 10-13 is less than 70-80, so no, dog's lifespan is not longer.

But I should be precise. Let me think about sources. From memory:

- Human global average lifespan: approximately 73 years (as per recent data).

- Dog average lifespan: varies, but according to sources like AKC or general vet info, it's often cited as 10-13 years for mixed breeds, but can be less for larger breeds.

Even the longest-living dogs don't reach human lifespans. The oldest recorded dog lived to 29 years, but that's exceptional. Average is much lower.

Step 4: Consider any caveats. Are there any types of dogs or humans where this might not hold? For example, very small dog breeds like Chihuahuas can live 15-20 years, but still less than human average in many places. Humans in some regions have lower lifespans, like in some developing countries it's around 60 years, but even then, 60 > 13.

The lowest human lifespan in some countries might be around 50-60 years, but dog's maximum average is still lower. For instance, the average lifespan for a dog is rarely above 15 years, and for humans, it's above that in most cases.

Step 5: Final comparison. Typical human lifespan: 70-80 years. Typical dog lifespan: 10-15 years. So, no, dog's lifespan is shorter.

Step 6: Answer format. The question asks for Yes or No, and to show reasoning. So, my final answer should be No.

Step 7: Make sure reasoning is step-by-step.

- Step 1: Identify the averages.

- Human average lifespan: approximately 72-73 years globally.

- Dog average lifespan: approximately 10-13 years, depending on breed.

- Step 2: Compare: 10-13 < 72-73, so no.

- Step 3: Consider extremes: Even long-lived dogs don't average longer than humans.

Final Answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Define the key terms**: The question asks about the *average lifespan*, which refers to the typical length of life for a species. I need to compare the average lifespan of dogs and humans based on reliable general knowledge and data.

2. **Recall average lifespan for humans**: 
   - The global average lifespan for humans is approximately 72-73 years, according to sources like the World Health Organization (WHO). This varies by region; for example, it's higher in developed countries (around 80 years) and lower in some developing regions (around 60-70 years). However, even in the lowest human lifespans, it's rarely below 60 years on average.

3. **Recall average lifespan for dogs**:
   - The average lifespan for dogs depends on factors like breed, size, and care. Small breeds (e.g., Chihuahuas) can live 15-20 years, while large breeds (e.g., Great Danes) often live only 7-10 years. Across all breeds, the average lifespan is commonly cited as 10-13 years by sources like the American Kennel Club (AKC) or veterinary studies. Even with optimal care, the average doesn't exceed 15 years for most dogs.

4. **Compare the two averages**:
   - Human average lifespan: 72-73 years (global estimate).
   - Dog average lifespan: 10-13 years (general estimate).
   - Clearly, 10-13 years is less than 72-73 years. Even considering the upper end of dog lifespans (e.g., 15 years for small breeds) or lower end of human lifespans (e.g., 60 years in some regions), the dog's average is still shorter.

5. **Consider exceptions and edge cases**:
   - The longest-lived dog on record lived to 29 years, but this is an extreme outlier and not representative of the average.
   - Similarly, humans in certain high-mortality areas might have shorter lives, but the global average still exceeds the dog's average.
   - No breed of dog has an average lifespan that approaches or exceeds the human average.

6. **Conclusion based on comparison**: After reviewing the data, the average lifespan of a dog is consistently shorter than that of a human across all standard metrics.

### Final Answer: No
