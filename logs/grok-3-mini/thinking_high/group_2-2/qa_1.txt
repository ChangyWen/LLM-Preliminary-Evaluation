*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is an elephant heavier than a blue whale?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that elephants and blue whales are both large animals, but I think blue whales are the largest animals on Earth. I should confirm that.

Recall some facts: Elephants are the largest land animals. The African elephant is the heaviest, with weights around 5 to 7 tons for adults. A ton is 2,000 pounds, so that's about 10,000 to 14,000 pounds.

Blue whales are marine mammals and are known to be the largest animals ever. I think they can weigh up to 200 tons. That sounds right. Let me make sure.

I remember that the average weight of a blue whale is around 100 to 150 tons, and the largest ones can be up to 200 tons. That's much heavier than an elephant.

To be precise, let's use approximate figures:

- Largest elephant (African bush elephant): up to 6-7 metric tons.

- Blue whale: adults can weigh between 100 to 150 metric tons, with some records up to 190 tons.

A metric ton is 1,000 kilograms, so:

- Elephant: max about 7,000 kg.

- Blue whale: min about 100,000 kg for smaller adults, up to 190,000 kg.

Clearly, even the smallest blue whales are heavier than the largest elephants.

Is there any exception? Are there baby blue whales or something? The question probably refers to adult animals, as is standard in such comparisons.

The question says "an elephant" and "a blue whale," which could be interpreted as typical or average adults.

Even if we consider the heaviest elephant and the lightest blue whale, I think blue whales are still heavier.

What's the weight range for blue whales? Newborn blue whales can weigh up to 2-3 tons, but that's not a full-grown one. The question likely implies adult animals.

Similarly, for elephants, we're talking about adults.

So, adult blue whale vs. adult elephant.

Adult blue whale: minimum weight for a mature blue whale is around 50-70 tons, I think. Let me think.

Upon second thought, I should use reliable knowledge. From what I recall:

- African elephant: up to 6 tons (13,000 pounds).

- Blue whale: average 100 tons, up to 200 tons.

Yes, definitely heavier.

To be thorough, let's compare numbers:

Elephant max weight: approximately 6,000 kg (since 6 metric tons = 6,000 kg).

Blue whale min adult weight: I think it's around 50,000 kg or more. Actually, blue whales can be as small as 70-80 tons for smaller individuals, but still, 70 tons is 70,000 kg, which is way more than 6,000 kg.

70 tons vs. 6 tons â€“ that's a factor of about 11-12 times heavier.

So, no doubt, blue whales are heavier.

The question is "Is an elephant heavier than a blue whale?" So, the answer should be No, because elephants are not heavier; blue whales are heavier.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the animals: Elephant (land animal) and blue whale (marine mammal).

2. Recall general knowledge: Blue whale is the largest animal on Earth.

3. Approximate weights:

   - Elephant: up to 7 tons.

   - Blue whale: up to 200 tons.

4. Compare: 7 tons < 200 tons, so elephant is lighter.

5. Even average weights: Elephant around 5 tons, blue whale around 100 tons.

6. Conclusion: Elephant is not heavier than blue whale.

Final answer should be No.

Is there any trick here? Like, is there a type of elephant or whale I'm missing? No, blue whale is specifically the largest.

Perhaps in terms of density or something, but the question is about weight, which is mass under gravity, so it's straightforward.

I'm confident with this.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the animals and their categories**: 
   - An elephant is a land animal, and the largest species is the African bush elephant.
   - A blue whale is a marine mammal and is widely recognized as the largest animal on Earth.

2. **Recall approximate weights based on general knowledge**:
   - The weight of an adult African elephant (the heaviest elephant species) ranges from about 4 to 7 metric tons (4,000 to 7,000 kg). The average adult elephant weighs around 5 tons.
   - The weight of an adult blue whale ranges from about 50 to 150 metric tons (50,000 to 150,000 kg), with some individuals reaching up to 190 tons. The average adult blue whale weighs around 100 tons.

3. **Compare the weights**:
   - Even the heaviest elephant (up to 7 tons) is significantly lighter than the lightest adult blue whale (starting at around 50 tons).
   - For example:
     - Maximum elephant weight: 7 tons.
     - Minimum adult blue whale weight: 50 tons.
     - This shows a difference of at least 43 tons, or a factor of about 7 times heavier for the blue whale.
   - Using average weights: An average elephant (5 tons) vs. an average blue whale (100 tons) shows an even larger gap.

4. **Consider potential edge cases**:
   - The question likely refers to adult animals, as is standard in such comparisons. If we consider a newborn blue whale (which can weigh 2-3 tons), it might be lighter than a large adult elephant. However, blue whales grow rapidly, and even young adults are much heavier than elephants. Since the question uses "a blue whale" without specifying age, it's reasonable to assume an adult for a fair comparison.
   - There are no known exceptions where an elephant could be heavier than an adult blue whale, as blue whales consistently outweigh elephants in all documented cases.

5. **Draw a conclusion based on the comparison**:
   - Since the maximum weight of an elephant is far less than the minimum weight of an adult blue whale, an elephant is not heavier than a blue whale.

### Final Answer: No
