First, the question is: "Is the freezing point of water higher than the boiling point of water?" I need to answer with a simple Yes or No, but also show my step-by-step reasoning.

I know that water has a freezing point and a boiling point. The freezing point is the temperature at which water turns from liquid to solid, and the boiling point is when it turns from liquid to gas.

From basic science, I recall that for water, the freezing point is 0 degrees Celsius, and the boiling point is 100 degrees Celsius. This is under standard atmospheric pressure.

Now, the question is asking if the freezing point is higher than the boiling point. So, is 0°C higher than 100°C? No, 0 is less than 100, so the freezing point is lower, not higher.

I should confirm if there are any conditions where this might not be true. For example, at different pressures, the boiling point can change. At higher altitudes, water boils at a lower temperature, say around 95°C, but the freezing point also changes slightly with pressure. However, even then, the freezing point is still lower than the boiling point. For water, the freezing point decreases very slightly with decreased pressure, but it's still much lower than the boiling point.

Under standard conditions, freezing point is 0°C and boiling point is 100°C. Even if pressure changes, the boiling point can be less than 100°C, but the freezing point is around 0°C or slightly less, so freezing point is still not higher.

Is there any scenario where freezing point could be higher than boiling point? I don't think so for water. That would imply that water is solid at higher temperatures than it boils, which doesn't make sense physically.

So, in all practical cases, the freezing point is lower than the boiling point.

Therefore, the answer should be No.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall the standard freezing and boiling points of water.

   - Freezing point: 0°C

   - Boiling point: 100°C (at sea level, standard pressure)

2. Compare the two temperatures.

   - Is 0°C > 100°C? No, 0°C < 100°C.

3. Consider if conditions affect this.

   - At different pressures, boiling point changes more significantly than freezing point.

   - Even at low pressure, boiling point might be 70°C or so, but freezing point is still around 0°C or slightly less, so still freezing point < boiling point.

4. Conclude that freezing point is not higher than boiling point.

Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the key terms**: The freezing point of water is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a solid (ice). The boiling point is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a gas (steam). These points are typically measured under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm or 101.3 kPa).

2. **Recall standard values**: Under standard conditions:
   - The freezing point of water is 0°C (32°F).
   - The boiling point of water is 100°C (212°F).

3. **Compare the values**: To determine if the freezing point is higher than the boiling point, compare 0°C and 100°C.
   - 0°C is less than 100°C, so the freezing point is lower, not higher.

4. **Consider variations due to pressure**: The boiling point of water can change with atmospheric pressure. For example:
   - At higher altitudes (lower pressure), the boiling point decreases (e.g., about 95°C at 5,000 feet).
   - At lower altitudes or higher pressure, the boiling point increases (e.g., above 100°C under high pressure).
   - The freezing point also changes slightly with pressure but remains close to 0°C (e.g., it might decrease slightly under very low pressure, but not significantly).
   - Even under varying pressures, the freezing point is always lower than the boiling point for water. For instance, if the boiling point drops to 70°C at very low pressure, the freezing point might be around -1°C or slightly less, but still lower.

5. **Check for any exceptions**: There are no known conditions (e.g., under normal earthly pressures or temperatures) where the freezing point of water could be higher than the boiling point. This would imply that water freezes at a higher temperature than it boils, which is physically impossible and contradicts the phase diagram of water.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the standard values and the behavior under varying conditions, the freezing point of water is not higher than the boiling point.

### Final Answer: No
