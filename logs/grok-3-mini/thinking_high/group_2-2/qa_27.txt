*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the boiling point of water lower than the melting point of ice?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that water and ice are the same substance, H2O, but in different states. Ice is solid water, and when it melts, it becomes liquid water. When liquid water boils, it turns into water vapor.

The melting point of ice is the temperature at which ice turns into liquid water. For pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, that's 0 degrees Celsius.

The boiling point of water is the temperature at which liquid water turns into vapor. Again, for pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, that's 100 degrees Celsius.

Now, the question is asking if the boiling point of water is lower than the melting point of ice. So, is 100°C lower than 0°C? That doesn't make sense because 100 is greater than 0.

Melting point of ice: 0°C

Boiling point of water: 100°C

Is 100°C < 0°C? No, 100°C is greater than 0°C.

The question specifies "water" and "ice," which are typically referred to under standard conditions unless otherwise specified. So, I think it's safe to assume standard pressure.

Even if pressure changes, the boiling point and melting point both change, but the boiling point is always higher than the melting point for a given substance at a given pressure. For water, as pressure increases, the melting point slightly increases, and the boiling point decreases, but they never cross; boiling point is always higher.

At standard pressure, melting point is 0°C, boiling point is 100°C. So, boiling point is higher.

The question is phrased as "boiling point of water lower than melting point of ice." Water and ice are the same substance, so it should be consistent.

Final answer should be No, because 100°C is not lower than 0°C.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the melting point of ice: Under standard conditions, it's 0°C.

2. Identify the boiling point of water: Under standard conditions, it's 100°C.

3. Compare the two values: Is 100°C < 0°C? No.

4. Therefore, the boiling point is not lower than the melting point.

5. Final answer: No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the key terms**:  
   - The melting point of ice is the temperature at which ice (solid water) turns into liquid water.  
   - The boiling point of water is the temperature at which liquid water turns into water vapor (gas).  
   - Both values depend on pressure, but the question does not specify any unusual conditions, so I will assume standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm or 101.3 kPa), which is the common reference point.

2. **Recall standard values**:  
   - At standard atmospheric pressure, the melting point of ice is 0°C (273.15 K).  
   - At the same pressure, the boiling point of water is 100°C (373.15 K).  
   - These values are well-established for pure water.

3. **Compare the two points**:  
   - The question asks if the boiling point of water (100°C) is lower than the melting point of ice (0°C).  
   - Numerically, 100°C is greater than 0°C, not less.  
   - In general, for any substance, the boiling point is always higher than the melting point under the same conditions because boiling involves a phase change from liquid to gas, which requires more energy than melting from solid to liquid.

4. **Consider potential variations**:  
   - If pressure changes, both melting and boiling points can shift. For example:  
     - At higher pressures, the melting point of ice increases slightly, and the boiling point decreases.  
     - However, even under varying pressures, the boiling point of water is never lower than its melting point for the same substance.  
   - Since the question does not mention non-standard conditions, the standard values (0°C and 100°C) are appropriate to use.

5. **Answer the question directly**:  
   - Is 100°C lower than 0°C? No, it is not.

### Final Answer:  
No
