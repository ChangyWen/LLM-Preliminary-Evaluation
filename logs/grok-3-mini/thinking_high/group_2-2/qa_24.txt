*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Does a day on Earth last longer than a day on Venus?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

A "day" can refer to two things: the solar day or the sidereal day. The solar day is the time from noon to noon, based on the Sun's position. The sidereal day is the time it takes for a planet to rotate once on its axis relative to the fixed stars.

In common usage, when we talk about the length of a day on a planet, we usually mean the solar day, because that's what determines our daily cycle of day and night.

For Earth, a solar day is 24 hours.

For Venus, I need to recall its solar day length. Venus has a very slow rotation and also rotates retrograde, meaning it spins in the opposite direction compared to most planets.

I think Venus's sidereal rotation period is about 243 Earth days, and it's retrograde. But the solar day is different because of the orbital motion.

The solar day and sidereal day are related. The solar day is longer than the sidereal day because as the planet rotates, it also orbits the Sun, so it takes a bit longer to have the Sun in the same position.

For Earth, sidereal day is about 23 hours 56 minutes, and solar day is 24 hours.

For Venus, since its rotation is very slow and retrograde, the solar day might be shorter or longer.

Venus's orbital period (year) is about 225 Earth days.

Sidereal rotation period of Venus is 243 Earth days, retrograde.

Because the rotation is retrograde, the solar day calculation might be different.

The formula for solar day length is related to the sidereal day and the orbital period.

The general formula is: 1 / (1 / P_sidereal - 1 / P_orbital) or something like that, but I need to be careful with the signs, especially since Venus rotates retrograde.

For a planet, the length of the solar day (P_solar) can be found from:

1 / P_solar = 1 / P_sidereal - 1 / P_orbital

This assumes prograde rotation. If rotation is retrograde, the sign might change.

If both rotation and orbit are in the same direction, P_solar > P_sidereal.

For retrograde rotation, it might be different.

For Venus, since it rotates retrograde, the Sun would appear to move in the opposite direction in the sky relative to the stars.

I think I've heard that a day on Venus (solar day) is about 117 Earth days.

Venus's sidereal day is 243 Earth days (retrograde).

Orbital period is 224.7 Earth days.

Because rotation is retrograde, the solar day should be shorter.

Let me calculate.

The formula for solar day when rotation and orbit are in opposite directions.

Generally, the solar day P_solar is given by:

P_solar = P_sidereal * P_orbital / (P_orbital - P_sidereal) or something.

Better to use angular speeds.

Angular speed of rotation ω_rot = 360 degrees / P_sidereal

Angular speed of orbit ω_orb = 360 degrees / P_orbital

The apparent motion of the Sun is ω_rot - ω_orb (for prograde).

For the time between two noons, it's the time for the planet to rotate such that it gains 360 degrees relative to the Sun.

The Sun's apparent motion is due to both rotation and orbital motion.

The sidereal rotation rate is ω_sid = 2π / P_sidereal

Orbital rate ω_orb = 2π / P_orbital

For prograde rotation, the solar day P_solar satisfies:

ω_sid - ω_orb = 2π / P_solar

So P_solar = 2π / (ω_sid - ω_orb) = 1 / (1/P_sidereal - 1/P_orbital)

For retrograde rotation, since Venus rotates opposite to its orbit, ω_sid is negative if we take orbit as positive.

Assume orbital motion is prograde, so ω_orb > 0.

For Venus, rotation is retrograde, so ω_sid < 0.

P_sidereal is positive, but direction is opposite.

Typically, P_sidereal is given as positive, but we need to consider the sign.

For Venus, P_sidereal = 243 days (magnitude), retrograde.

P_orbital = 224.7 days.

Since rotation is retrograde, the angular speeds are in opposite directions.

So, the relative angular speed for the Sun is ω_sid (magnitude) + ω_orb, because they are in opposite directions.

Let’s define positive direction as the direction of orbit.

For Venus, orbital angular speed ω_orb = 2π / P_orbital > 0

Rotational angular speed ω_rot = -2π / P_sidereal (since retrograde), so ω_rot = -2π / 243 days

The apparent angular speed of the Sun as seen from the planet is ω_rot - ω_orb (because the Sun's position depends on the difference).

In the inertial frame, the Sun is fixed for this purpose, but for solar day, it's the time for a fixed point on the planet to face the Sun again.

So, the angular speed relative to the Sun is the rotational angular speed minus the orbital angular speed.

More carefully: the time for one solar day is the time to rotate 360 degrees relative to the Sun.

In that time, the planet rotates by angle θ_rot = ω_rot * t

And the orbital motion means the direction to Sun changes by ω_orb * t

For the Sun to be in the same position, the net rotation relative to Sun should be 360 degrees.

So, θ_rot - ω_orb * t = 2π (for prograde), but with signs.

Generally, the condition is that the change in the angle between the planet's meridian and the direction to Sun is 360 degrees.

The direction to Sun changes due to orbital motion.

For a planet, P_solar = 1 / |1/P_sidereal ± 1/P_orbital|, depending on direction.

For Venus, since rotation and orbit are in opposite directions, the solar day is shorter.

Calculation: P_sidereal = 243 days, P_orbital = 224.7 days.

Since retrograde, the formula is P_solar = 1 / (1/P_sidereal + 1/P_orbital) because the signs add up.

ω_relative = |ω_rot| + ω_orb, since opposite directions.

ω_rot magnitude is 2π / 243 per day, ω_orb is 2π / 224.7 per day.

So angular speed relative to Sun is ω_rot_mag + ω_orb (both contributing to the same direction for solar day).

Time for 2π radians is P_solar = 2π / (ω_rot_mag + ω_orb) = 1 / (1/P_sidereal + 1/P_orbital)

Since P_sidereal and P_orbital are both in days.

So P_solar = 1 / (1/243 + 1/224.7)

Let me calculate that.

First, 1/243 ≈ 0.004115226

1/224.7 ≈ 0.004449733

Sum ≈ 0.004115226 + 0.004449733 = 0.008564959

Then P_solar ≈ 1 / 0.008564959 ≈ 116.75 days

Yes, so approximately 117 Earth days for a solar day on Venus.

Now, for Earth, solar day is 24 hours, which is 1 day.

To compare, a day on Earth is 1 Earth day, while on Venus it's about 117 Earth days.

So, clearly, a day on Venus is much longer than on Earth.

The question is: "Does a day on Earth last longer than a day on Venus?"

Earth day: 1 day

Venus day: 117 days

So, Earth day is shorter, Venus day is longer.

If Earth day is 1 day, Venus day is 117 days, so Venus day lasts longer.

The question is: Does Earth day last longer than Venus day?

No, Earth day is shorter.

Let me read the question: "Does a day on Earth last longer than a day on Venus?"

Last longer means duration is greater.

Duration of Earth day: 24 hours

Duration of Venus solar day: about 117 * 24 hours, which is much larger.

So, no, Earth day does not last longer; it's shorter.

But I should confirm if "day" means solar day or sidereal day.

In the context, probably solar day, as that's the common understanding.

But just to be thorough, let's check sidereal days.

Earth sidereal day: about 23.93 hours

Venus sidereal day: 243 Earth days, which is much longer.

Sidereal day on Venus is 243 days, while on Earth it's less than a day.

So, in both cases, whether solar or sidereal, a day on Venus is longer.

For sidereal day:

Earth: ~24 hours

Venus: 243 days ≈ 5832 hours

Much longer.

For solar day:

Earth: 24 hours

Venus: ~117 days ≈ 2808 hours

Still much longer.

So, in either interpretation, a day on Venus is longer than on Earth.

Therefore, the answer to "Does a day on Earth last longer than a day on Venus?" is No.

But let me make sure about the solar day on Venus.

I recall that yes, it's approximately 116.75 Earth days, often rounded to 117.

And it's longer than the sidereal day because of the retrograde rotation.

In this case, since rotation is slow and retrograde, solar day is shorter than sidereal day but still very long.

Sidereal day is 243 days, solar day is 117 days, so solar day is shorter than sidereal day for Venus, which makes sense because of retrograde rotation.

But compared to Earth, both are longer.

Earth solar day: 1 day

Venus solar day: 117 days > 1 day

Yes.

So, final answer should be No.

The question is phrased: "Does a day on Earth last longer than a day on Venus?"

Answer: No.

And I need to box it.

But let me write the step-by-step reasoning.

Step 1: Define what a "day" means. Typically, it refers to the solar day, the time from noon to noon.

Step 2: For Earth, solar day is 24 hours.

Step 3: For Venus, solar day is approximately 117 Earth days.

Step 4: Compare the durations: 24 hours vs. 117 * 24 hours. Clearly, Venus day is longer.

Step 5: Therefore, a day on Earth does not last longer than a day on Venus.

Even if considering sidereal day, same conclusion.

So, final answer is No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To answer the question, "Does a day on Earth last longer than a day on Venus?", I will reason step by step. In this context, "a day" typically refers to the solar day, which is the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky (e.g., from noon to noon). This is the most common understanding of a day, as it relates to the cycle of daylight and darkness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Define the solar day for Earth:**
   - A solar day on Earth is the time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position, which is exactly 24 hours (or 1 Earth day).

2. **Define the solar day for Venus:**
   - Venus has a very slow rotation and rotates retrograde (in the opposite direction to its orbit around the Sun).
   - The sidereal rotation period of Venus (time to rotate once relative to the stars) is approximately 243 Earth days.
   - The orbital period of Venus (time to orbit the Sun) is approximately 224.7 Earth days.
   - Because Venus's rotation is retrograde, the solar day is calculated using the formula for the relative angular speeds:  
     \[
     P_{\text{solar}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{P_{\text{sidereal}}} + \frac{1}{P_{\text{orbital}}}}
     \]
     Substituting the values:  
     \[
     P_{\text{solar}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{243} + \frac{1}{224.7}} \approx \frac{1}{0.004115 + 0.004450} \approx \frac{1}{0.008565} \approx 116.75 \text{ Earth days}
     \]
     This is often rounded to approximately 117 Earth days for simplicity.

3. **Compare the durations:**
   - Earth's solar day: 24 hours (or 1 Earth day).
   - Venus's solar day: approximately 117 Earth days, which is equivalent to about 117 × 24 = 2,808 hours.
   - Clearly, 24 hours (Earth) is much shorter than 2,808 hours (Venus).

4. **Consider alternative interpretations (sidereal day):**
   - If "day" refers to the sidereal day (time to rotate once relative to the stars), the comparison is:
     - Earth's sidereal day: approximately 23.93 hours (slightly less than 24 hours).
     - Venus's sidereal day: 243 Earth days (or about 5,832 hours).
     - Even in this case, Venus's sidereal day is much longer than Earth's.
   - However, since the question likely refers to the solar day (as it is the common understanding of a "day"), the solar day comparison is most relevant.

5. **Conclusion based on the comparison:**
   - A solar day on Earth (24 hours) is shorter than a solar day on Venus (approximately 117 Earth days).
   - Therefore, a day on Earth does not last longer than a day on Venus.

### Final Answer:  
No
