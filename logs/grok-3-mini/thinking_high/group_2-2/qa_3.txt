*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?" I need to answer with a simple Yes or No, but I must show my step-by-step reasoning process.

To answer this, I need to know the death years of both Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein.

I recall that Isaac Newton was a scientist from the 17th and 18th centuries. He was born in 1642 and died in 1727. Yes, that's right.

Albert Einstein was a 20th-century physicist. He was born in 1879 and died in 1955. I think that's correct.

Now, the question is about who died later. So, I need to compare their death years.

Newton died in 1727.

Einstein died in 1955.

1955 is later than 1727, so Einstein died later than Newton.

But the question is: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?"

If Newton died in 1727 and Einstein in 1955, then Newton died earlier, not later. So the answer should be No.

Let me read the question again: "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?"

- Newton died in 1727.

- Einstein died in 1955.

Is 1727 later than 1955? No, 1727 is before 1955.

Therefore, Newton did not die later than Einstein; he died earlier.

So the answer is No.

I should confirm the dates to be sure.

Isaac Newton: Born December 25, 1642 (Julian calendar), died March 20, 1727 (Gregorian calendar). Yes.

Albert Einstein: Born March 14, 1879, died April 18, 1955. Yes.

No doubt about the years.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the death year of Isaac Newton: 1727.

2. Identify the death year of Albert Einstein: 1955.

3. Compare the two years: 1727 vs. 1955.

4. Determine if 1727 is later than 1955: No, it is earlier.

5. Therefore, Isaac Newton did not die later than Albert Einstein.

Final answer: No.

The question asks for "Yes or No", so I should just say No at the end.

Also, ensure that I'm not confusing birth and death dates. The question is clearly about death dates.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To answer the question "Did Isaac Newton die later than Albert Einstein?", I will reason step by step based on historical facts about their lifespans.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify Isaac Newton's death year**: Isaac Newton, the English mathematician and physicist, was born in 1642 and died in 1727. Specifically, he died on March 20, 1727 (using the Gregorian calendar).
   
2. **Identify Albert Einstein's death year**: Albert Einstein, the German-born theoretical physicist, was born in 1879 and died in 1955. Specifically, he died on April 18, 1955.

3. **Compare the death years**: 
   - Newton's death year: 1727.
   - Einstein's death year: 1955.
   - To determine if Newton died later, we compare the years: 1727 is earlier than 1955 because 1727 comes before 1955 on the timeline.

4. **Interpret the question**: The question asks if Isaac Newton died later than Albert Einstein. Based on the comparison, Newton died in 1727, while Einstein died in 1955. Since 1727 is not later than 1955, the answer is no.

### Final Answer: No
