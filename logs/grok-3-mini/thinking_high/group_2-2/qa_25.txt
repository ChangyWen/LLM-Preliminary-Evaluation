First, the question is: "Is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth less than that on the Moon?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Acceleration due to gravity is the rate at which an object accelerates towards the center of a planet when dropped. It's denoted by 'g'.

I know that on Earth, g is approximately 9.8 m/s². On the Moon, it's less because the Moon is smaller and has less mass.

The formula for acceleration due to gravity is g = G * M / R², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and R is the radius of the planet.

For Earth and Moon, G is the same, but M and R are different.

Earth has a larger mass and a larger radius than the Moon. But mass has a bigger effect because it's in the numerator.

I recall that the Moon's gravity is about 1/6th of Earth's. So, if Earth's g is 9.8 m/s², Moon's g should be around 1.63 m/s².

Yes, standard value: Moon's g is approximately 1.62 m/s².

So, comparing: Earth g = 9.8 m/s², Moon g = 1.62 m/s².

Is 9.8 less than 1.62? No, 9.8 is greater than 1.62.

The question is: "Is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth less than that on the Moon?"

So, is Earth's g < Moon's g? 9.8 < 1.62? No, that's false.

Earth's gravity is stronger, so acceleration is higher on Earth.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall the formula: g = G M / R².

2. Earth has greater mass M_earth > M_moon.

3. Earth has greater radius R_earth > R_moon.

4. But since g depends on M/R², we need to see the ratio.

I know from memory that g_moon is less.

Astronauts on the Moon can jump higher, which means less gravity, so lower acceleration due to gravity.

So, Earth's g is greater than Moon's g.

Therefore, is Earth's g less than Moon's g? No.

Final answer should be No.

The question is clear: "less than that on the Moon", meaning is g_earth < g_moon?

Answer is No.

I should box the answer as per instruction.

Also, ensure the reasoning is step-by-step.

Let me write it out.

To determine whether the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is less than that on the Moon, I will reason step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the concept of acceleration due to gravity
- Acceleration due to gravity, denoted as \(g\), is the rate at which an object accelerates toward the center of a celestial body (like a planet or moon) under the influence of gravity.
- The formula for \(g\) is given by \(g = \frac{G \cdot M}{R^2}\), where:
  - \(G\) is the gravitational constant (approximately \(6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}\), which is the same for all bodies),
  - \(M\) is the mass of the celestial body,
  - \(R\) is the radius of the celestial body.

### Step 2: Compare the masses and radii of Earth and the Moon
- Earth's mass (\(M_{\text{Earth}}\)) is approximately \(5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}\).
- Earth's radius (\(R_{\text{Earth}}\)) is approximately \(6.37 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}\).
- The Moon's mass (\(M_{\text{Moon}}\)) is approximately \(7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg}\).
- The Moon's radius (\(R_{\text{Moon}}\)) is approximately \(1.74 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}\).
- From this, we see that:
  - \(M_{\text{Earth}} > M_{\text{Moon}}\) (Earth is much more massive),
  - \(R_{\text{Earth}} > R_{\text{Moon}}\) (Earth is larger in size).

### Step 3: Analyze the effect on \(g\) using the formula
- Since \(g = \frac{G \cdot M}{R^2}\), \(g\) depends on the mass (\(M\)) in the numerator and the square of the radius (\(R^2\)) in the denominator.
- A higher mass increases \(g\), while a larger radius decreases \(g\).
- Earth has a much larger mass than the Moon, but it also has a larger radius. However, the mass difference has a greater impact because mass is directly proportional to \(g\), while radius is inversely proportional and squared.
- Using known values:
  - Earth's \(g\) is approximately \(9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\).
  - The Moon's \(g\) is approximately \(1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2\) (often cited as about \(1/6\) of Earth's gravity).

### Step 4: Compare the values
- Earth's \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\).
- Moon's \(g = 1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2\).
- Is Earth's \(g\) less than the Moon's \(g\)? No, because \(9.8 > 1.62\).

### Step 5: Conclusion
- The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is greater than that on the Moon, not less.

**Final answer: No**
