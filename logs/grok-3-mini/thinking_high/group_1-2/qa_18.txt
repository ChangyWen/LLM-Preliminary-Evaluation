*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Cattaraugus County, NY located west of Cambria County, PA?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their geographical positions. Specifically, I need to find the longitude of both counties and see which one has a lower longitude value, since longitude increases eastward and decreases westward in the Western Hemisphere.

Longitude lines run north-south, and values increase from east to west in the negative direction for the Americas. In the Western Hemisphere, longitudes are negative, with higher negative numbers being further west. For example, -70° is east of -80°, because -70 is greater than -80 numerically, but geographically, -80° is west of -70°.

If longitude A is more negative than longitude B, then A is west of B. For instance, New York City is around -74°, and Los Angeles is around -118°, so -118° is west of -74°.

So, I need the approximate longitudes of Cattaraugus County in New York and Cambria County in Pennsylvania.

I know that New York State is generally east of Pennsylvania. New York is to the north and northeast of Pennsylvania, but parts of western New York might be west or east relative to parts of Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania is a state that spans from about 74.5°W to 80.5°W longitude. Philadelphia is around 75°W, and Pittsburgh is around 80°W. So Pennsylvania goes from roughly east to west.

New York State: New York City is about 74°W, but western New York, like Buffalo, is further west. Buffalo is near Niagara Falls, which is on the border with Canada, and I think Buffalo is around 78.5°W or something like that.

I should recall approximate longitudes.

Let me think about key cities.

For Cattaraugus County, NY: I believe it's in western New York. Cattaraugus County is south of Buffalo, in the Allegheny region. Buffalo is approximately 78.8°W longitude.

Cambria County, PA: That's in western Pennsylvania. Johnstown is in Cambria County, and Pittsburgh is nearby. Pittsburgh is about 80°W longitude.

Pittsburgh is around 80°W, yes. Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh, I think. Pennsylvania: Philadelphia is 75.1°W, Harrisburg is around 76.9°W, Pittsburgh is 79.9°W or about 80°W. So western PA is around 80°W.

Cambria County: Johnstown, PA is located at approximately 78.9°W longitude. I think Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is at the western end, so Cambria County might be a bit east.

Upon second thought, Pennsylvania's western border is with Ohio, and Pittsburgh is near that border. Longitude-wise, Ohio goes to about 84.5°W at its western end, but Pennsylvania's western part is around 80.5°W for the border.

Standard longitudes:

- New York City: 74°W

- Buffalo, NY: approximately 78.8°W

- Pittsburgh, PA: approximately 80.0°W

Cattaraugus County, NY: It's in southwestern New York, bordering Pennsylvania. I think it's around the same longitude as Buffalo or slightly west.

Buffalo is at 78.8°W, and Cattaraugus County is south of Buffalo, but probably similar longitude. Maybe around 78.5° to 79°W.

Cambria County, PA: Johnstown, PA is at about 78.9°W longitude. Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is at 80.0°W, and Johnstown is northeast of Pittsburgh, so it should have a lower longitude number, meaning east.

Longitude decreases as you go east in the negative scale. No: in degrees west, higher number means further west.

Standard: longitude is measured with west being negative, but often we say degrees west.

Pittsburgh, PA: approximately 79.99°W, so about 80°W.

Johnstown, PA: I think it's around 78.83°W or something. Actually, I believe Johnstown is at about 78.9°W, which is less west than Pittsburgh's 80°W, so Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh.

78.9°W is east of 80°W because 78.9 is closer to 0, so less negative if we think in negative degrees.

Let's use numerical values.

Assume longitude in degrees west:

- Pittsburgh, PA: ~80.0°

- Johnstown, PA (Cambria County): Johnstown is located at approximately 78.92°W for latitude and longitude—wait, longitude is about 78.92°W I think, but that can't be right because that would be east of Philadelphia.

I think I have it wrong.

Recall: Philadelphia is 75.16°W, Pittsburgh is 79.98°W, so Pittsburgh is further west.

Cambria County is central Pennsylvania. Johnstown is in the Allegheny Mountains, and it's west of Harrisburg but east of Pittsburgh? No, Pittsburgh is in the west.

Pennsylvania longitude range: from about 74.5°W in the east (Delaware River) to 80.5°W in the west (Ohio border).

Pittsburgh is near 80°W, close to the western border.

Johnstown, PA is southeast of Pittsburgh. Upon thinking, Johnstown is about 40 miles east of Pittsburgh or something? No, Pittsburgh to Johnstown is about 60 miles east, I think.

Actually, Pittsburgh is at 40.44°N, 79.99°W.

Johnstown is at approximately 40.32°N, 78.92°W. 78.92°W is less than 79.99°W, so 78.92°W is east of 79.99°W because smaller degree west means closer to the prime meridian, thus east.

Degrees west: 78.92°W is at 78.92 degrees west, 79.99°W is at 79.99 degrees west, so 79.99 is further west than 78.92.

Numerically, 79.99 > 78.92, so higher number means further west.

So Pittsburgh at 80°W is west of Johnstown at 78.92°W? That doesn't make sense geographically.

I think I have the longitude wrong for Johnstown.

Let me correct that. I believe Johnstown, PA is actually at around 78.9°W, but Pittsburgh is at 80°W, so if Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh, its longitude should be smaller, like 78.9°W vs 80°W, yes, 78.9 is less west, so east.

Confirm with known facts: the prime meridian is 0°, so moving west, longitude increases in the negative direction or we say higher degrees west.

Standard: longitude west of Greenwich.

Philadelphia: 75.17°W

Harrisburg: about 76.88°W

Altoona (near Cambria County): Altoona is in Blair County, adjacent, at about 78.4°W.

Pittsburgh: 79.99°W

Johnstown, PA: upon recollection, Johnstown is at approximately 78.92°W longitude and 40.32°N latitude. 78.92°W is less than 79.99°W, so Johnstown is at 78.92°W, Pittsburgh at 80.0°W, so Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh because 78.92 < 80.0 in degrees west, meaning it's closer to the east.

Yes, that's correct. Pittsburgh is further west.

Now, Cambria County includes Johnstown, so its central longitude is around 78.9°W.

Now, Cattaraugus County, NY: This is in western New York. Buffalo is at 78.88°W, and Cattaraugus County is south of Buffalo, bordering Pennsylvania.

The western part of New York: Buffalo is at 78.88°W, and the state border with Pennsylvania is around there.

New York's westernmost point is near Erie, PA, but New York doesn't go that far west. The border: New York-Pennsylvania border is along 42°N latitude for part, but longitude-wise.

Buffalo is on Lake Erie, and Lake Erie is between, with Pennsylvania's northwest corner at about 80.5°W.

Pennsylvania's western border with Ohio is at approximately 80.5°W longitude.

New York's western border is with Pennsylvania and includes counties like Chautauqua and Cattaraugus.

Chautauqua County is the westernmost in NY, with Jamestown at about 79.2°W or something.

Buffalo, NY: 78.878°W

Cattaraugus County: it spans from about 78.5°W to 79.0°W or so. Olean, a town in Cattaraugus County, is near the Pennsylvania border.

Olean, NY is at approximately 78.7°W longitude.

Now, the Pennsylvania-New York border: at the southern end, it's around 78.5°W to 79.5°W or something.

Perhaps I can think of the approximate centers.

Since both counties border each other or are close, I need to see their relative positions.

Cattaraugus County, NY is directly north of parts of Pennsylvania, including Potter and McKean counties in PA.

Cambria County, PA is further south and east.

Cambria County is in south-central Pennsylvania, while Cattaraugus is in southwestern New York.

So, likely, Cattaraugus is west of Cambria.

Let's get longitudes.

Approximate longitude for Cattaraugus County, NY: let's say the county seat is Little Valley or Olean. Olean is at about 78.43°W (I think, but I'm not sure).

Actually, upon better recollection, Buffalo is 78.88°W, and moving south, longitudes might change slightly.

Generally, western New York longitudes are around 78-79°W.

For Cambria County, PA: Johnstown is at 78.92°W longitude? Earlier I said 78.92, but let's confirm.

I think I have a mistake. Let me think about Pittsburgh: 79.99°W.

Distance from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia: Pittsburgh is west, so higher longitude.

Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh. The longitude of Johnstown: I believe it's around 78.9°W, but that would be 78.9, which is less than 79.99, so yes.

78.9°W is east of 80°W.

Now, for comparison, Buffalo, NY is at 78.88°W, which is very close to Johnstown's 78.92°W? That can't be right because Buffalo and Johnstown are not at the same longitude.

Geographically, Buffalo is north of Erie, PA, and Erie, PA is at about 80.1°W longitude.

Erie, PA is on Lake Erie, western Pennsylvania, longitude approximately 80.08°W.

Buffalo, NY is directly north across the lake, but slightly east or west? Buffalo is at 78.88°W, Erie is at 80.08°W, so Buffalo is east of Erie? That doesn't make sense.

I think I have the longitudes wrong.

Let me correct this.

Standard longitudes:

- New York City: 74.006°W

- Buffalo, NY: 78.878°W (yes)

- Erie, PA: Erie is at approximately 80.085°W

- Pittsburgh, PA: 79.991°W

Erie is west of Pittsburgh? No, Erie is north of Pittsburgh, but longitude-wise, Erie is at 80.085°W, Pittsburgh at 79.991°W, so Erie is slightly west of Pittsburgh? 80.085 > 79.991, so yes, Erie is west of Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh is at 80°W approximately, Erie is at 80.1°W, so Erie is very slightly west.

But distance-wise, Erie is northwest of Pittsburgh.

Now, Johnstown, PA: Johnstown is southeast of Pittsburgh. Johnstown longitude is approximately 78.916°W.

78.916°W for Johnstown.

Compared to Pittsburgh's 79.991°W, 78.916 < 79.991, so Johnjohnstown is east of Pittsburgh.

Yes.

Now, Cattaraugus County, NY: Let's find a point. Olean, NY, in Cattaraugus County, is at approximately 78.43°W longitude (I think it's around there).

Upon thinking, Buffalo is at 78.878°W, and Olean is south, but longitudes might be similar or slightly different.

Actually, moving south from Buffalo, the longitude doesn't change much; it's more latitudinal.

Cattaraugus County spans longitudes from about 78.5°W to 79.0°W or so.

Let's assume the western part.

The New York-Pennsylvania border in that area: the border is not a constant longitude; it's irregular.

But generally, western New York is around 78-79°W, while eastern Pennsylvania is 75-76°W, western PA is 80°W.

Cambria County is in central PA. Johnstown is at 78.92°W, as per standard data.

Cattaraugus County: the county is located between 42°N and 42.5°N, and longitudes from about 78.4°W to 79.0°W.

For example, the town of Salamanca in Cattaraugus County is at approximately 78.71°W.

Let's take average.

Compared to Johnstown at 78.92°W.

If Cattaraugus has points at 78.7°W, that's less than 78.92°W, so west.

78.7°W vs 78.92°W: 78.7 is 78.70, 78.92 is greater, so 78.92°W is further west than 78.70°W? No.

Degrees west: higher number means further west.

So 78.92°W is west of 78.70°W because 78.92 > 78.70.

For example, 80°W is west of 79°W.

So if Johnstown is at 78.92°W, and a point in Cattaraugus is at, say, 78.7°W, then 78.7°W is east of 78.92°W.

That would mean Cattaraugus is east of Cambria, but that can't be right geographically.

I think I have the longitude for Johnstown wrong.

Let me think again.

Upon second thought, I believe Johnstown, PA is at longitude around 78.9°W, but let's confirm with known facts.

Actually, I recall that Philadelphia is 75.2°W, Pittsburgh is 80.0°W, and Johnstown is between them.

Distance: from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh is about 300 miles, longitude difference from 75.2 to 80.0 is 4.8 degrees.

Johnstown is closer to Pittsburgh, but still, let's say it's at about 78.9°W or so.

But for Buffalo, NY at 78.88°W, which is very close.

Buffalo and Johnstown are at similar longitudes, but Buffalo is north, Johnstown is south.

Cattaraugus County is west of Buffalo or east?

Buffalo is in Erie County, Cattaraugus is south and slightly west or east.

Actually, Cattaraugus County is west of Buffalo. No, Buffalo is at the western end, Cattaraugus is south, but the westernmost part of NY is Chautauqua County west of Erie County.

Erie County (Buffalo) is at 78.88°W, Chautauqua County (Jamestown) is at about 79.25°W, so further west.

Cattaraugus County is east of Chautauqua, so around 78.5-79.0°W.

Let's get accurate.

Upon standard knowledge, the longitude of Olean, NY (in Cattaraugus County) is approximately 78.43°W.

Johnstown, PA is at 78.92°W.

78.43°W vs 78.92°W: 78.43 < 78.92, so 78.43°W is east of 78.92°W because smaller degree west means closer to prime meridian.

For example, 78.43°W is less west than 78.92°W, so it's east.

But that would mean Olean is east of Johnstown, but geographically, Olean is in New York, Johnstown in Pennsylvania, and New York is north, but longitudes.

Perhaps I have the numbers wrong.

Let's think about the map.

I know that the Mississippi River is at about 90°W, Chicago at 87.6°W, Detroit at 83.0°W, Cleveland at 81.7°W, Buffalo at 78.9°W approximately.

Buffalo is at 78.88°W.

Pittsburgh is at 80.0°W, so Buffalo is east of Pittsburgh.

Longitude 78.88 vs 80.00, 78.88 < 80.00, so Buffalo is east of Pittsburgh.

Yes.

Now, Johnstown, PA:  I believe Johnstown is at 78.92°W, which is very close to Buffalo's 78.88°W.

In fact, Buffalo at 78.88°W, John  at 78.92°W, so Johnstown is slightly west of Buffalo.

78.92 > 78.88, so 78.92°W is west of 78.88°W.

Yes, so Johnstown is slightly west of Buffalo.

But Cattaraugus County is south of Buffalo, in New York.

The western part of Cattaraugus County borders Chautauqua County, which is further west.

Chautau  County has longitudes up to 79.5°W or so.

Jamestown, NY is at approximately 79.24°W.

Cattaraugus County is east of that, so  perhaps 78.5 to 79.0°W.

For example, the eastern part of Cattaraugus might be at 78.5°W, western part at 79.0°W.

Let's assume the center.

Cattaraug  County longitude range: from about 78.4°W to 79.0°W.

Johnstown, PA at 78.92°W.

So the western part of Cattaraugus is at 79.0°W, which is west of 78.92°W? 79.0 > 78.92, so 79.0°W is west of 78.92°W.

Yes.

For example, if Cattaraugus has points at 79.0°W, and Cambria at 78.92°W, then some parts of Cattaraugus are west of Cambria.

But the question is about the county as a whole. Typically, we compare the approximate locations or centers.

Cambria County is not just Johnstown; it spans a range.

Cambria County longitude range: from about 78.5°W to 79.0°W or something.

Johnstown is at 78.92°W, and the county extends east and west.

Upon thinking, Cambria County is roughly from 78.6°W to 78.9°W or so.

Let's think.

Pittsburgh is at 80.0°W, and Cambria is east of it, so longitudes less.

Actually, the western border of Cambria County is near Ebensburg, etc.

Perhaps the average longitude of Cambria County is around 78.8°W.

For Cattaraugus, average around 78.7°W or 78.8°W.

I need better way.

I can think of the states.

New York State  western border is at about 79.  W for Chautau  County, while Pennsylvania western border is at 80.5°W.

Cattaraugus County is in the  south-western NY, and Cambria is in central PA.

From memory, Cattaraugus County is located west of the 79°W meridian, while Cambria is east.

Let's use a different approach.

I know that the Allegheny River flows through western PA, and Cattaraugus is on the Allegheny Plateau.

Perhaps I can recall that Buffalo is at the same longitude as central PA.

But from standard knowledge, western New York is generally west of eastern PA but east of western PA.

Cambria County is in the ridge and valley province, while Cattaraugus is in the Appalachian Plateau.

Geographically, if I imagine a map, New York is to the north, Pennsylvania to the south, so for the same longitude, NY is north.

But for west-east, Cattaraugus is in the western part of NY, Cambria is in the central part of PA.

Pennsylvania is wider east-west than New York in that region.

New York's width is less.

The longitude of Albany, NY is 73.75°W, Buffalo 78.88°W, so NY spans from 71.5°W to 79.76°W or so.

PA spans from 74.86°W to 80.52°W.

  So PA extends further west.

Cattaraugus County is in the western end of NY, longitude around 78-79°W.

Cambria County is in PA, with longitude around 78-79°W as well.

Specifically, the westernmost point of NY is at about 79.76°W in Chautauqua County.

Cattaraugus County is adjacent, so its western longitude is about 79.0°W, eastern at 78.4°W or something.

Cambria County's western longitude:  it borders Indiana County, and Pittsburgh is west, so Cambria's western border is at about 78.8°W or so.

Upon standard data, the longitude of the center of Cattaraugus County is approximately 78.7°W, and for Cambria County, around 78.8°W or 78.9°W.

I found a way: I can think that Cattaraugus County borders Pennsylvania, and the border is at longitudes where PA's northern counties are.

For example, McKean County, PA is north of Cambria, and McKean is at longitudes around 78.5-78.8°W.

Cambria is south of that, at similar longitudes.

Actually, upon correct recollection, Johnstown, PA is at 78.916°W, and Olean, NY is at 78.429°W for longitude? 78.429°W is less, so east.

I think Olean is at 42.0778°N, 78.4297°W, yes.

Johnstown is at 40.3264°N, 78.9186°W.

So Olean at 78.4297°W, Johnstown at 78.9186°W.

78.4297 < 78.9186, so Olean is at a smaller degree west, so it is east of Johnstown.

78.4297°W is closer to the prime meridian than 78.9186°W, so Olean is east of Johnstown.

But Olean is in New York, Johnstown in Pennsylvania, and New York is north, but longitudes show Olean at 78.43°W, Johnstown at 78.92°W, so Johnstown is further west.

So Cattaraugus County has Olean at 78.43°W, but its western part is further west.

What is the westernmost point of Cattaraugus County? I think it's around 78.8°W or so.

Cattaraugus County longitude range: from about 78.4°W to 79.0°W.

For example, the town of Randolph in Cattaraugus County is at 78.98°W or something.

Upon thinking, the county extends to the west.

Actually, Cattaraugus County's western border is with Chautauqua County, and Chautauqua has longitudes up to 79.5°W.

Cattaraugus is east of that.

From standard data, Cattaraugus County longitudes from approximately 78.4° W to 79.0° W.

Min longitude 78.4°W, max 79.0°W.

Cambria County: min longitude around 78.6°W, max 78.9°W or something.

Johnstown at 78.92°W, and the county extends east to about 78.5°W.

Let's assume the center.

To determine if Cattaraugus is west of Cambria, I need to see if the entire county or the center is west.

Typically, for such questions, we compare the approximate locations.

From Olean at 78.43°W and Johnstown at 78.92°W, but Olean is a point, not the center.

The county seat of Cattaraugus is Little Valley at approximately 42.25°N, 78.80°W.

Little Valley, NY at 42.25°N, 78.80°W.

Cambria County's county seat is Ebensburg at approximately 40.48°N, 78.72°W.

Ebensburg, PA at 40.485°N, 78.724°W.

So longitude of Little Valley: 78.80°W

Longitude of Ebensburg: 78.72°W

78.80 > 78.72, so 78.80°W is west of 78.72°W.

Because higher degree west means further west.

So Little Valley at 78.80°W is west of Ebensburg at 78.72°W.

Therefore, Cattaraugus County (center at 78.80°W) is west of Cambria County (center at 78.72°W).

78.80 > 78.72, yes, so more west.

Numerically larger westward longitude.

Yes.

To confirm, the difference is small, but yes.

Even if I take other points, the western parts.

But based on county seats, which are often used as reference points.

So, yes, Cattaraugus County is located west of Cambria County.

But earlier I thought Johnstown is at 78.92°W, which is west of Ebensburg's 78.72°W? No, Ebensburg is the county seat, probably central.

Johnstown is within Cambria County, at 78.92°W, which is further west than Ebensburg's 78.72°W.

78.92 > 78.72, so Johnstown is west of Ebensburg.

But both are in Cambria County.

Now, for Cattaraugus, Little Valley at 78.80°W.

Compare 78.80°W (Cattaraugus center) and 78.72°W (Cambria center), so 78.80 > 78.72, so Cattaraugus is west.

But Johnstown in Cambria is at 78.92°W, which is even further west, at 78.92°W vs Cattaraugus's 78.80°W.

78.92 > 78.80, so Johnstown is west of Little Valley.

That would mean part of Cambria is west of Cattaraugus.

Johnstown at 78.92°W, Little Valley at 78.80°W, so 78.92 > 78.80, so Johnstown is further west.

So Cambria County has points west of Cattaraugus County.

But the centers: Ebensburg at 78.72°W, Little Valley at 78.80°W.

Perhaps the average.

Geographically, since both counties span similar longitude ranges, but Cambria might extend further west.

Cambria County's westernmost point: I think it goes to about 78.95°W or so.

Cattaraugus's westernmost is around 79.0°W.

Earlier I said Cattaraugus up to 79.0°W.

For example, the village of Randolph, NY in Cattaraugus County is at about 78.98°W.

Johnstown, PA at 78.92°W.

So 78.98 > 78.92, so Randolph is west of Johnstown.

Eastern part of Cattaraugus at 78.4°W, eastern part of Cambria at say 78.6°W.

So overall, Cattaraugus County has longitudes from about 78.4° to 79.0°W, Cambria from about 78.6° to 79.0°W or slightly less.

Upon better estimate, Cambria County's longitude range is from approximately 78.55°W to 78.95°W.

Cattaraugus from 78.40°W to 79.00°W.

So the western parts are similar, but Cattaraugus extends slightly east and west.

But the center or average might be similar.

However, since the question is "located west of", it might be ambiguous, but typically for counties, if the majority or the center is west.

From the county seats: Little Valley at 78.80°W, Ebensburg at 78.72°W, so Little Valley is west.

Difference is small, only 0.08 degrees, about 5 miles or so.

But geographically, since New York is north, and the border, but in terms of east-west, Cattaraugus is slightly west.

I am considering the straight line.

But I think based on longitude, Cattaraugus County is generally west of Cambria County.

To be precise, parts of Cattaraugus are east of parts of Cambria, but overall, the county as a whole is west.

For example, the easternmost of Cattaraugus at 78.4°W is east of westernmost of Cambria at 78.95°W, but the centers are close.

But since the average longitude of Cattaraugus might be higher.

Perhaps it's safer to say yes, based on common understanding.

I can think of the states: western NY is west of central PA.

Cambria County is considered central Pennsylvania, while Cattaraugus is western New York.

And western NY is generally west of central PA.

For example, Buffalo is at same longitude as Harrisburg or something, Harrisburg is at 76.88°W, Buffalo at 78.88°W, so Buffalo is west of Harrisburg.

Cambria is west of Harrisburg, at 78.9°W vs 76.9°W.

But compared to each other.

Perhaps the best is to use the county seat longitudes.

Little Valley: 78.80°W

Ebensburg: 78.72°W

So 78.80 > 78.72, so west.

Moreover, the population centers: Olean at 78.43°W is east, but Johnstown at 78.92°W is west.

But I think for the purpose of this question, it's likely yes.

To confirm, I can think of driving: from Cattaraugus to Cambria, you go southeast, which includes both south and east, so it might not be purely west.

If you go from Cattaraugus County to Cambria County, you are going south and slightly east, so Cambria is east of Cattaraugus.

If you go from a point in Cattaraugus to a point in Cambria, since Cambria is south but at similar or slightly east longitude, but from the numbers, Ebensburg at 78.72°W, Little Valley at 78.80°W, so to go from 78.80 to 78.72, you are going east.

Longitude decreasing means going east.

So from Cattaraugus to Cambria, you are going to a smaller longitude number, so east.

So Cattaraugus is west of Cambria? No.

If Cambria has smaller longitude (78.72°W) than Cattaraugus (78.80°W), then Cambria is east of Cattaraugus.

Longitude: smaller degree west means closer to prime meridian, so east.

So if Ebensburg is at 78.72°W and Little Valley at 78.80°W, then 78.72<W is less west, so east of 78.80°W.

So Eb  at 78.72°W is east of Little Valley at 78.80°W.

So Cambria County center is east of Cattaraugus County center.

That means Cattaraugus is west of Cambria? No: if A is at 78.80°W and B at 78.72°W, then A is west of B, because 78.80 > 78.72 in degrees west.

Yes: 78.80°W is further west than 78.72°W.

For example, 80°W is west of 79°W.

So 78.80°W is west of 78.72°W.

Yes, so Cattaraugus at 78.80°W is west of Cambria at 78.72°W.

Numerically, 78.80 > 78.72, so more west.

Yes.

For Johnstown at 78.92°W, which is in Cambria, 78.92 > 78.80, so Johnstown is west of Little Valley.

So  the western part of Cambria is west of the center of Cattaraugus.

But the eastern part of Cambria is at, say, 78.55°W or so, which is east of 78.80°W.

So it's mixed.

But for the county as a whole, if we take the center, Cattaraugus center at 78.80°W, Cambria center at 78.72°W, so Cattaraugus is west.

Perhaps the question expects a simple answer based on general location.

I think the answer is yes, Cattaraugus is west of Cambria.

To be precise, let's assume the average longitude.

For Cattaraugus, from 78.4 to 79.0, average 78.7°W.

For Cambria, from 78.6 to 78.9, average 78.75°W or so.

Still, 78.7 vs 78.75, 78.7 < 78.75? 78.7 is 78.70, 78.75 is larger, so 78.75°W is west of 78.70°W.

If Cattaraugus average 78.7°W, Cambria average 78.75°W, then Cambria is further west.

I'm confusing myself.

Let's clarify.

If Cattaraugus longitude range 78.4 to 79.0, average (78.4 + 79.0)/2 = 78.7°W.

Cambria: let's say from 78.55 to 78.95, average 78.75°W.

78.75 > 78.7, so 78.75°W is further west than 78.7°W.

So Cambria average longitude is 78.75°W, Cattaraugus 78.7°W, so Cattaraugus is east of Cambria? No.

78.7<W vs 78.75<W, 78.75 is larger number, so more west.

So if Cattaraugus at 78.7°W, Camb  at 78.75°W, then 78.75 > 78.7, so Cambria is west of Cattaraugus.

That can't be right geographically.

Perhaps my range is wrong.

For Cattaraugus County, the longitude range is from about 78.4°W (east) to 79.0°W (west), so min 78.4, max 79.0.

For Cambria, min longitude (east) is about 78.55°W, max (west) 78.95°W.

So min Cattaraugus 78.4, min Cambria 78.55, so 78.4 < 78.55, so  eastern part of Cattaraugus is east of eastern part of Cambria.

Max Cattaraugus 79.0, max Cambria 78.95, 79.0 > 78.95, so western part of Cattaraugus is west of western part of Cambria.

So the counties overlap in longitude, with Cattaraugus extending both further east and further west.

But the center might be similar.

For the question "is located west of", it might not be strictly true, as parts are east and  some are west.

But typically, for such questions, if the main part or center is west, but in this case, it's ambiguous.

However, from the county seats, Little Valley at 78.80, Ebensburg at 78.72, so 78.80 > 78.72, so Cattaraugus center is west.

Moreover, the population of Cattaraugus is more in the west, I think.

Perhaps the answer is yes.

I can think of the state capitals or something.

Albany at 73.75°W, Harrisburg at 76.88°W, but that's not helpful.

I think I'll go with yes.

Final answer: Yes

But to be accurate, let's assume based on the initial reasoning.

So I think the answer is Yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if Cattaraugus County, NY is located west of Cambria County, PA, I will compare their geographical positions using longitude, as longitude determines east-west location. Longitude is measured in degrees west of the Prime Meridian, with higher numerical values indicating further west in the Western Hemisphere.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand Longitude Comparison**: 
   - Longitude values increase as you move west (e.g., 78.80°W is west of 78.72°W because 78.80 > 78.72).
   - I will use the approximate longitudes of the county seats as reference points, as they are often used to represent the central location of a county. The county seat of Cattaraugus County is Little Valley, NY, and for Cambria County, it is Ebensburg, PA.

2. **Locate the County Seats and Their Longitudes**:
   - Little Valley, NY (Cattaraugus County seat): Approximately 78.80°W.
   - Ebensburg, PA (Cambria County seat): Approximately 78.72°W.

3. **Compare the Longitudes**:
   - 78.80°W (Little Valley) vs. 78.72°W (Ebensburg).
   - Since 78.80 > 78.72, Little Valley is west of Ebensburg.

4. **Consider the Counties as a Whole**:
   - Counties span a range of longitudes. Cattaraugus County ranges from approximately 78.40°W to 79.00°W, with an average around 78.70°W.
   - Cambria County ranges from approximately 78.55°W to 78.95°W, with an average around 78.75°W.
   - Comparing the averages: 78.70°W (Cattaraugus) vs. 78.75°W (Cambria). Since 78.75 > 78.70, the average longitude of Cambria is slightly further west.
   - However, based on the county seats (78.80°W vs. 78.72°W), Cattaraugus is west. The counties overlap in longitude, with parts of each being east or west of the other, but the center comparison favors Cattaraugus being west.

5. **Geographical Context**:
   - Cattaraugus County is in western New York, while Cambria County is in central Pennsylvania. Generally, western New York is west of central Pennsylvania, supporting the conclusion based on the center points.
   - The small longitude difference (about 0.08 degrees, or roughly 5 miles) indicates they are close, but the county seat comparison shows Cattaraugus as west.

6. **Conclusion Based on Standard Interpretation**:
   - For questions like this, the location is typically determined by the central or average position. Given that the county seat of Cattaraugus (78.80°W) is west of that of Cambria (78.72°W), and considering the general geographical context, Cattaraugus County is located west of Cambria County.

### Final Answer: Yes
