*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Was Alfonso of Molina born earlier than Yao Shu? Show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)."

I need to determine the birth years of Alfonso of Molina and Yao Shu and compare them.

I know that Alfonso of Molina is likely a historical figure from Europe, probably Spain, given the name. Molina might refer to a place in Spain. I recall that Alfonso of Molina could be Alfonso Téllez de Meneses or something similar, but I'm not sure. Actually, I think Alfonso of Molina refers to Alfonso of Castile, who was also known as Alfonso of Molina. Let me confirm that.

Upon thinking, Alfonso of Molina is probably Alfonso IX of León or someone else. I need to recall accurately. I believe Alfonso of Molina is Alfonso Téllez de Meneses, a nobleman from the 13th century, but I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps it's Alfonso X of Castile, who was called the Wise, but I'm not sure about the "of Molina" part.

Actually, upon second thought, Alfonso of Molina might refer to Alfonso of Castile, son of Ferdinand III, who was Lord of Molina. I think he lived in the 13th century. Let me assume I need to know the birth year.

Now, Yao Shu – that sounds like a Chinese name. Yao Shu could be a historical figure from China. I think Yao Shu might refer to a person from the Song Dynasty or perhaps earlier. I'm not sure. Perhaps it's Yao Shu from the Jin Dynasty or something. I need to recall or know the birth years.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I should use general knowledge or logical steps. But in reality, I need factual information. As an AI, I have access to knowledge up to my last training data.

From my knowledge:

- Alfonso of Molina: I believe this refers to Alfonso of Molina, who was a son of King Alfonso IX of León and Queen Berengaria of Castile. Actually, upon correction, Alfonso of Molina is often associated with Alfonso Téllez de Meneses or perhaps Alfonso X. Let's clarify.

After thinking, I recall that Alfonso of Molina is Alfonso Téllez de Meneses, but more commonly, it might be Alfonso, Count of Molina, who was a medieval Spanish noble. I think he was born in the 13th century. Specifically, I think Alfonso of Molina lived around 1200-1272 or something. I need exact years.

Perhaps it's Alfonso X of Castile, born in 1221.

But "of Molina" specifies it. Upon better recollection, Alfonso of Molina is Alfonso of Castile, who was the brother of King Ferdinand III, and he was born in 1204 and died in 1272. I think that's it.

Confirming: Alfonso of Molina, son of Alfonso IX of León and Berengaria, born in 1204.

Now, Yao Shu: This is trickier. Yao Shu could be a Chinese historical figure. I think there is a Yao Shu who was a general or official in ancient China. Perhaps from the Three Kingdoms period or later.

Upon thinking, I recall that Yao Shu might refer to Yao Shu (姚璹), who was a chancellor in the Tang Dynasty. Let's see.

Actually, I think Yao Shu is likely Yao Shu (姚舜), but that might not be right. Perhaps it's Yao Shu from the Song Dynasty.

After searching my knowledge, I believe Yao Shu refers to Yao Shu (姚璹), a Tang Dynasty figure. Born in 640 AD and died in 711 AD, I think. Wait, is that correct?

No, let's think: Tang Dynasty was from 618 to 907 AD. Yao Shu – I think there is a famous Yao Shu, but I'm not sure.

Perhaps it's Yao Shu from the Ming Dynasty or something. This is vague.

Upon better recollection, I think Yao Shu might be a less common name. Perhaps it's Yao Shun, but that's a legendary emperor.

Maybe Yao Shu is Yao Shu (姚叔), but I need to specify.

After thinking, I recall that in some contexts, Yao Shu could be Yao Shu, a Jin Dynasty (1115-1234) figure or something. But let's assume standard historical figures.

Perhaps in the context of this question, Yao Shu is from Chinese history. Let me assume it's Yao Shu, who was a minister in the Northern Song Dynasty or something.

Upon standard knowledge, I think Yao Shu might refer to Yao Shu (姚蟠), but I'm not sure.

Let's try to find approximate birth years.

From memory:

- Alfonso of Molina: Born in 1204 AD (as per historical records, Alfonso of Molina, 1204-1272).

- Yao Shu: If I recall correctly, there is a Yao Shu who was a Tang Dynasty official. For example, Yao Chong was a Tang chancellor, born in 650 AD, died 721 AD. But his name is Yao Chong, not Yao Shu.

Yao Shu – perhaps it's a different person. Upon thinking, I found that there is a Yao Shu in Chinese history, perhaps from the Yuan Dynasty or earlier.

After better recollection, I think Yao Shu might be Yao Shu (姚枢), a scholar from the Song Dynasty, born in 1203 AD and died in 1280 AD. Is that right?

Let's confirm: Upon my knowledge, Yao Shu (姚枢) was a Confucian scholar and official in the Song Dynasty, born in 1203 and died in 1280.

Yes, that sounds familiar.

So, Alfonso of Molina: born in 1204 AD.

Yao Shu: born in 1203 AD.

If that's correct, then Yao Shu was born in 1203, Alfonso in 1204, so Yao Shu was born earlier.

But the question is: Was Alfonso of Molina born earlier than Yao Shu?

If Alfonso born 1204, Yao Shu born 1203, then Alfonso was born later, so the answer should be No.

But let me double-check the identities.

First, Alfonso of Molina: Historically, Alfonso of Molina refers to Alfonso of Castile, Lord of Molina, born on November 23, 1204, and died on January 6, 1272. He was the brother of King Ferdinand III of Castile.

Second, Yao Shu: In Chinese history, Yao Shu (姚枢) was a philosopher and statesman of the Song Dynasty. He was born in 1203 and died in 1280. Yes, that seems correct.

So, birth years: Yao Shu - 1203 AD, Alfonso of Molina - 1204 AD.

Therefore, Alfonso was born in 1204, which is after 1203, so he was born later than Yao Shu.

Thus, was Alfonso born earlier than Yao Shu? No.

But to be precise, earlier means born before, so if Yao Shu born 1203, Alfonso 1204, then Alfonso was not born earlier; Yao Shu was born earlier.

So the answer should be No.

But let me make sure there are no mistakes in identification.

Is there another Yao Shu? Upon quick search in my knowledge, Yao Shu is commonly referred to as the Song Dynasty figure born in 1203.

Similarly, Alfonso of Molina is correctly identified.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the historical figures: Alfonso of Molina and Yao Shu.

2. Recall or know their birth years.

   - Alfonso of Molina: 1204 AD.

   - Yao Shu: 1203 AD.

3. Compare the birth years: 1204 vs. 1203.

4. Since 1204 is later than 1203, Alfonso was born after Yao Shu.

5. Therefore, Alfonso was not born earlier than Yao Shu.

Final answer: No.

The question asks for Yes or No, and to box it.

So, I think that's it.
