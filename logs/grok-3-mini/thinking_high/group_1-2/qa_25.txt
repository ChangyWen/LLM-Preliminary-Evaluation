*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is 32796, FL located north of 32751, FL?" I need to determine if the location with ZIP code 32796 in Florida is north of the location with ZIP code 32751 in Florida. The answer should be yes or no, with step-by-step reasoning.

ZIP codes in the US are geographic codes, and in Florida, they can indicate approximate locations. To compare north-south positions, I need to know the latitude of these ZIP codes.

I don't have a map or database memorized, so I need to reason based on general knowledge or patterns in ZIP codes.

ZIP codes are assigned in a way that often follows a grid or regional pattern. In Florida, ZIP codes starting with 32 are in the central part, including areas around Orlando.

- 32751: I think this is in Florida. Let me recall: 32751 is associated with Maitland or Winter Park area, which is near Orlando.

- 32796: I'm not sure, but it might be in a different part. Perhaps Titusville or something in the Space Coast area.

I should think about the ZIP code ranges. In Florida, ZIP codes increase as you go from west to east or something, but it's not strictly linear.

A better way is to consider the central digits or look for patterns.

Since both start with 32, they are likely in the same general region. The last three digits might indicate sub-regions.

But to determine north-south, latitude is key.

I can think about known cities:

- ZIP code 32751: I believe this is Altamonte Springs, Florida. Yes, Altamonte Springs is north of Orlando.

- ZIP code 32796: I think this is Titusville, Florida. Titusville is on the east coast, near the Kennedy Space Center.

Now, comparing their locations:

- Altamonte Springs (32751) is in Seminole County, just north of Orlando.

- Titusville (32796) is in Brevard County, on the Atlantic coast, and it's further north and east.

Is Titusville north of Altamonte Springs?

Orlando is around 28.5° N latitude. Altamonte Springs is very close to Orlando, so similar latitude.

Titusville is north of Orlando. Yes, Titusville is about 30-40 minutes drive north of Orlando along I-95.

Actually, from Orlando, you go east to the coast, but Titusville is northeast.

Recalling approximate latitudes:

- Orlando is approximately 28.54° N.

- Altamonte Springs is very close, maybe 28.66° N or something similar.

- Titusville is around 28.61° N? Wait, I think Titusville is slightly north.

Upon second thought, Titusville is at about 28.57° N, but I need accurate recall.

I know that driving from Orlando to Titusville, you go north on I-95, so yes, Titusville is north of Orlando.

Confirming the ZIP codes:

- 32751: Yes, Altamonte Springs, FL. Latitude approximately 28.661° N.

- 32796: Titusville, FL. Latitude approximately 28.612° N? Wait, that might be wrong.

I think Titusville is at 28.57° N, and Orlando is 28.54° N, so very close.

But is 32796 north or south?

Perhaps I have it wrong.

Let's think about ZIP code areas.

I recall that ZIP codes in Florida: lower numbers might be south, but it's not consistent.

Better to use city knowledge.

Altamonte Springs is in the Orlando metro area, central Florida.

Titusville is also in central Florida but on the coast.

Geographically, Titusville is north of Orlando. Orlando is inland, Titusville is on the coast to the northeast.

From Orlando, going to Titusville, you head east-northeast, and it's slightly north.

Confirming with approximate coordinates:

- Orlando: 28.5383° N, 81.3789° W

- Altamonte Springs (32751): around 28.66° N, 81.37° W (very close to Orlando, slightly north)

Altamonte Springs is north of downtown Orlando. Downtown Orlando is south of Altamonte.

Orlando city proper has various ZIP codes, but 32751 is Altamonte Springs, which is north of Orlando.

Titusville: 28.6122° N, 80.8191° W

Comparing latitudes:

- Altamonte Springs (32751): approximately 28.6614° N (let's assume from memory)

- Titusville (32796): approximately 28.6122° N

28.6122° N for Titusville and 28.6614° N for Altamonte Springs? That would mean Altamonte Springs is north of Titusville, but that can't be right because Titusville is north of Orlando, and Altamonte is also north but perhaps not as far.

I think I have the latitudes wrong.

Let me correct: Orlando is 28.54° N.

Altamonte Springs is north of Orlando, so higher latitude, say 28.66° N.

Titusville is further north? No, Titusville is at about 28.57° N, I think it's very close.

Upon better recollection:

- Downtown Orlando: 28.5398° N

- Altamonte Springs: located at approximately 28.6614° N (yes, north of Orlando)

- Titusville: located at approximately 28.6122° N (wait, 28.6122 is less than 28.6614? No, 28.6122 vs 28.6614, 28.6614 is higher latitude, so north.

28.6614° N is Altamonte, 28.6122° N is Titusville? That would mean Titusville is south of Altamonte Springs, but that's not correct.

I think I have Titusville's latitude wrong.

Let me think: Cocoa Beach is south of Titusville, and Cocoa Beach is around 28.3° N or something? No.

Kennedy Space Center is near Titusville, and it's at about 28.5° N.

Standard knowledge: Orlando is 28.5° N, Miami is 25.7° N, Jacksonville is 30.3° N.

Titusville is between Orlando and Daytona Beach. Daytona Beach is at 29.2° N, Orlando is 28.5° N, so Titusville should be around 28.6° N.

Upon accurate recall, Titusville, FL is at approximately 28.612° N, and Altamonte Springs is at 28.661° N.

28.661 > 28.612, so Altamonte Springs has higher latitude, meaning it's north of Titusville.

But that can't be right because geographically, Titusville is north-east of Orlando, while Altamonte is directly north.

Let's check the actual latitudes.

I think I have it backward.

Orlando international airport is at 28.4294° N, but downtown Orlando is higher.

Better to use standard data.

From memory, Altamonte Springs is at about 28.66° N, and Titusville is at about 28.61° N, but 28.66 is north of 28.61? No, latitude increases north, so 28.66° N is north of 28.61° N.

But is Titusville south of Altamonte Springs? That doesn't sound right.

Perhaps Titusville is at a lower latitude.

Let's think about driving: from Orlando, to go to Titusville, you take SR-50 east or I-95 north, but I-95 from Orlando to Titusville is northbound.

Orlando is not on I-95; I-4 runs through Orlando, and I-95 is east, intersecting at Daytona or something.

From Orlando, to Titusville, you can take FL-408 or FL-50 east to Titusville, and it's northeast, so both latitude and longitude change.

Approximate latitudes:

- Orlando (city center): 28.5383° N

- Altamonte Springs: 28.6614° N (north of Orlando)

- Titusville: 28.6122° N (slightly south of Altamonte but north of Orlando center? 28.6122 vs 28.5383, 28.6122 is north of 28.5383)

28.6122° N for Titusville and 28.6614° N for Altamonte Springs, so 28.6614 > 28.6122, so Altamonte Springs is at higher latitude, thus north of Titusville.

But that seems counterintuitive. Let me verify.

Upon second thought, I think Titusville is at about 28.57° N or something. No, let's think about Daytona Beach: Daytona is at 29.21° N, Orlando is 28.54° N, Titusville is between, closer to Orlando.

Actual latitude for Titusville is approximately 28.61° N, and for Altamonte Springs, it's 28.66° N.

Yes, so 28.66 > 28.61, so Altamonte Springs is north of Titusville.

But is that accurate? Let me confirm with logic.

Altamonte Springs is north of Orlando, and Titusville is northeast of Orlando, but slightly less north.

From Orlando, Altamonte is directly north, Titusville is east-northeast, and the latitude of Titusville is slightly less than Altamonte's.

Yes, upon recalling, Altamonte Springs is at about 28.66° N, Titusville at 28.61° N, so Altamonte is north.

But the question is: is 32796 (Titusville) north of 32751 (Altamonte Springs)?

If Titusville is at 28.61° N and Altamonte at 28.66° N, then Titusville is south of Altamonte Springs.

So, 32796 is not north of 32751; it's south.

But is that correct? I think I have the ZIP codes right.

Confirm ZIP codes:

- 32751: Yes, Altamonte Springs, FL.

- 32796: Yes, Titusville, FL.

Now latitudes:

- Altamonte Springs: approximately 28.6614° N

- Titusville: approximately 28.6122° N

Yes, so 28.6122 < 28.6614, so Titusville is at lower latitude, thus south of Altamonte Springs.

Therefore, 32796 is not north of 32751; it's south.

So the answer should be no.

But earlier I thought Titusville was north, but geographically, while it's northeast, the latitude is slightly less because it's east, and the coast might have different latitude.

Actually, upon double-checking my memory, I think Titusville is at similar latitude, but let's confirm the numbers.

I could think about the ZIP code order, but latitude is the way to go.

Another way: Orlando's northern suburbs like Altamonte are at higher latitude, while Titusville is on the coast and slightly south in latitude but east.

Yes, so based on that, 32796 (Titusville) is not north of 32751 (Altamonte Springs); it's actually south.

So the answer is no.

To be thorough, let's make sure of the exact locations.

I can recall that from Orlando, driving north on I-4 takes you to Altamonte and beyond, while to Titusville, you go east on highways, and Titusville is not directly north.

In fact, mapping it, Altamonte Springs is at a higher northern latitude.

Yes, I think it's correct.

So step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the locations: 32751 is Altamonte Springs, FL; 32796 is Titusville, FL.

2. Recall approximate latitudes: Altamonte Springs ≈ 28.66° N, Titusville ≈ 28.61° N.

3. Compare latitudes: Since 28.66° N > 28.61° N, Altamonte Springs is north of Titusville.

4. Therefore, 32796 (Titusville) is not located north of 32751 (Altamonte Springs); it is south.

Final answer: No.

To determine if the location with ZIP code 32796 in Florida is north of the location with ZIP code 32751 in Florida, I will reason step by step based on geographic knowledge of ZIP codes and their associated locations.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the ZIP code locations:**
   - ZIP code 32751 corresponds to Altamonte Springs, Florida, which is in Seminole County, part of the Orlando metropolitan area.
   - ZIP code 32796 corresponds to Titusville, Florida, which is in Brevard County, on the east coast of Florida near the Kennedy Space Center.

2. **Understand the geographic context:**
   - Both locations are in central Florida, but they are in different counties and have different positions relative to Orlando.
   - Altamonte Springs is directly north of downtown Orlando, while Titusville is northeast of Orlando, closer to the Atlantic coast.

3. **Compare latitudes to determine north-south position:**
   - Latitude is the key factor for determining whether one location is north or south of another. Higher latitude values indicate a more northerly position.
   - Approximate latitude for Altamonte Springs (32751): 28.6614° N.
   - Approximate latitude for Titusville (32796): 28.6122° N.
   - Comparing the latitudes: 28.6614° N (Altamonte Springs) is greater than 28.6122° N (Titusville), meaning Altamonte Springs is at a higher latitude and thus farther north.

4. **Draw the conclusion:**
   - Since Titusville (32796) has a lower latitude than Altamonte Springs (32751), Titusville is south of Altamonte Springs, not north.

### Final Answer:
No
