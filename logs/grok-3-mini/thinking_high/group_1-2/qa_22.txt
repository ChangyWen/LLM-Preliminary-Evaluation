*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Dal-Tex Building, TX located south of Lake Martin, AL?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to understand the locations. Dal-Tex Building is in Texas (TX), and Lake Martin is in Alabama (AL). So, we're comparing the positions of a building in Texas and a lake in Alabama.

Dal-Tex Building – I'm not immediately familiar with this. It might be a specific building, perhaps in Dallas, Texas, since "Dal" could stand for Dallas. I recall there's a Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, associated with the JFK assassination. Assuming that's what it is, it's in Dallas, Texas.

Lake Martin is in Alabama. I know that Lake Martin is a reservoir in Alabama, near Alexander City.

Now, the question is whether the Dal-Tex Building in Texas is located south of Lake Martin in Alabama.

To determine this, I need to compare their latitudes because "south of" refers to a direction on a map, which is determined by north-south position.

So, step 1: Find the latitude of Lake Martin, AL.

Alabama is in the southeastern United States. Lake Martin is in central Alabama. I think its latitude is around 32-33 degrees North. Let me recall: Birmingham, AL is about 33.5°N, and Montgomery is around 32.3°N. Lake Martin is near Alexander City, which is probably similar. Upon thinking, Lake Martin is at approximately 32.9°N latitude.

Step 2: Find the latitude of Dal-Tex Building in TX.

Assuming it's in Dallas, Texas. Dallas is in north-central Texas. I know Dallas is around 32.8°N latitude. Wait, is that right? I think Dallas is about 32.78°N.

Both seem very close. Let me double-check.

Actual latitudes:

- Dallas, TX: Approximately 32.7767°N

- Lake Martin, AL: Lake Martin is in Alabama. Alexander City, AL, where Lake Martin is located, is about 32.9444°N. Wait, that might be slightly north of Dallas.

I need accurate comparisons.

General knowledge:

- Alabama is east of Texas.

- Both states span similar latitudes, but let's see the specific locations.

Texas is wider, so Dallas is in the north-central part.

Alabama is smaller and more eastern.

Latitudes:

- Southernmost point of Texas is around 26°N, northernmost around 36°N.

- Dallas is about 32.8°N.

- Alabama: Southernmost around 30°N, northernmost around 35°N.

- Lake Martin is in central Alabama. Upon recall, it's around 33°N or so.

I think Dallas, TX is at 32.78°N, and Birmingham, AL is at 33.52°N, Montgomery at 32.38°N.

Lake Martin is near Tallapoosa County, AL. Latitude of Alexander City, AL is approximately 32.95°N.

Dallas, TX is 32.78°N.

So, 32.95°N for Lake Martin vs 32.78°N for Dallas.

That means Lake Martin is at a higher latitude than Dallas, so it's north of Dallas.

Latitude increases as you go north, so higher latitude means further north.

If Lake Martin is at 32.95°N and Dallas is at 32.78°N, then Lake Martin is north of Dallas.

But the question is whether Dal-Tex Building (in Dallas, TX) is south of Lake Martin (in AL).

If Dallas is at lower latitude (32.78°N) and Lake Martin at higher latitude (32.95°N), then yes, Dallas is south of Lake Martin.

But are they directly comparable? Latitude alone doesn't tell the whole story because they are not on the same longitude.

Longitude matters for east-west position, but for north-south comparison, latitude is key, assuming we're talking about the same meridian or generally.

In general, if one place has a lower latitude, it is south of a place with higher latitude, regardless of longitude, in terms of global position.

For example, Miami, FL at 25.76°N is south of New York at 40.71°N, even though they are at different longitudes.

Similarly, here, Dallas at 32.78°N and Lake Martin at approximately 32.95°N.

Confirming Lake Martin's latitude.

Upon second thought, I might have the numbers wrong.

Let me think: Dallas, TX latitude is 32.7767°N.

Now, Alexander City, AL (near Lake Martin): looking it up in my knowledge, it's about 32.9444°N. Yes.

32.9444°N > 32.7767°N, so Lake Martin is at higher latitude, thus further north.

Therefore, any point at 32.7767°N is south of a point at 32.9444°N.

But since they are not at the same longitude, technically, the straight-line distance might have components, but in terms of cardinal directions, if we consider the Earth as a sphere, a location with lower latitude is generally south of one with higher latitude.

Moreover, in common usage, we say a city is south of another if its latitude is lower.

Now, longitudes: Dallas is around 96.797°W, and Alexander City, AL is around 85.95°W.

So, Dallas is further west.

But for the north-south comparison, latitude is the primary factor.

So, since latitude of Dal-Tex Building (Dallas) is lower than that of Lake Martin, it is south of it.

But is Dal-Tex Building exactly in Dallas? Assuming yes.

Now, to be precise, let's confirm the exact location.

Dal-Tex Building: I believe it's at 501 Elm Street, Dallas, TX, which is indeed in Dallas.

Latitude should be similar to Dallas city center.

Now, is there any chance that Dal-Tex Building is not in Dallas? The name suggests Dallas-Texas, so probably it is.

Perhaps it's a typo or something, but I'll assume it's in Dallas.

Now, another thing: the question says "Dal-Tex Building, TX" and "Lake Martin, AL", so it's clear.

Now, latitudes: Dallas ~32.78°N, Lake Martin ~32.94°N.

Difference is small, about 0.16 degrees, which is roughly 10 miles (since 1 degree latitude is about 69 miles).

So, yes, Lake Martin is north of Dallas.

Therefore, Dal-Tex Building is south of Lake Martin.

But is that accurate? Latitude difference: 32.94 - 32.78 = 0.16 degrees.

1 degree of latitude is approximately 111 km (69 miles), so 0.16 * 111 ≈ 17.76 km, or about 11 miles.

So, yes, Lake Martin is about 11 miles north of the latitude of Dallas.

However, since they are at different longitudes, the actual great-circle distance and direction might vary, but generally, Dallas is south and west of Lake Martin.

Specifically for north-south, since latitude is lower, it is south.

To confirm, if I draw a line of constant longitude, moving from Lake Martin south would cross into lower latitudes, and Dallas is at lower latitude.

But since longitudes are different, the shortest path might not be directly south, but in terms of global position, Dallas is both south and west of Lake Martin.

The question is only about "south of", which typically means having a lower latitude.

In geographical terms, we often say a place is south of another if it's generally in that direction.

For example, Los Angeles is south of San Francisco, even though not exactly on the same meridian.

Similarly here.

To be thorough, I can think about the coordinates.

Lake Martin: approx. 32.95°N, 85.95°W

Dallas: 32.78°N, 96.80°W (more precisely)

So, difference in latitude: Δlat = 32.95 - 32.78 = 0.17°N (Lake Martin north)

Difference in longitude: Δlon = 85.95 - 96.80 = -10.85° (since west is negative, but magnitude: Dallas is further west by about 10.85 degrees.

1 degree longitude at that latitude: circumference is smaller, but roughly, at 33°N, longitude degree is about cos(33°) * 111 km ≈ 0.8387 * 111 ≈ 93 km per degree.

So, Δlon = 10.85° * 93 km/deg ≈ 1009 km west.

Δlat = 0.17° * 111 km/deg ≈ 18.87 km north for Lake Martin relative to Dallas latitude.

But since Dallas is at lower latitude and further west.

To find if Dallas is south of Lake Martin, we look at the latitude: yes, lower latitude means south.

The bearing from Lake Martin to Dallas: it would be southwest, since west and south components.

But the south component is present because of lower latitude.

So, yes, Dallas is located south (and west) of Lake Martin.

Therefore, the Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, TX is south of Lake Martin in AL.

But the question is "located south of", and in absolute terms, yes.

Is there any trick? For example, is Dal-Tex Building not in Dallas? I think it is.

Perhaps Dal-Tex Building is a different place, but I doubt it.

Maybe in Texas, there's another Dal-Tex something, but probably not.

So, based on this, the answer should be Yes.

But let me confirm the latitudes again.

Upon double-checking my memory:

- Dallas, TX: 32.7767°N

- Alexander City, AL: 32.9444°N (from memory or approximation)

Yes.

I can think of known cities: For example, Montgomery, AL is at 32.3669°N, which is south of Dallas, but Lake Martin is north of Montgomery.

Montgomery is 32.3669°N, Alexander City is north of it.

Actually, Montgomery is at 32.37°N, Birmingham is at 33.52°N.

Alexander City is between, closer to Montgomery.

Distance: Montgomery to Birmingham is about 90 miles north, Montgomery 32.37°N, Birmingham 33.52°N, difference 1.15°, so about 80 miles.

Alexander City is roughly halfway or a bit north of Montgomery.

Actually, Alexander City is at about 32.94°N, yes.

Dallas is 32.78°N, so slightly south.

To be precise, I can consider that the latitude of Lake Martin is higher, so any point directly south would have lower latitude.

Hence, Dal-Tex Building is south of Lake Martin.

So, the answer should be Yes.

The question is "Is Dal-Tex Building, TX located south of Lake Martin, AL?"

And based on latitude, yes.

Perhaps the building is at a specific coordinate, but it's minor.

So, I think it's safe to say Yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if the Dal-Tex Building in Texas is located south of Lake Martin in Alabama, I will reason step by step based on geographical coordinates, focusing on latitude, as "south of" is primarily determined by north-south position.

### Step 1: Identify the locations
- The Dal-Tex Building is assumed to be in Dallas, Texas, based on its name (likely referring to the historic building at 501 Elm Street, associated with the JFK assassination). Dallas, TX, has approximate coordinates of 32.7767°N latitude and 96.7970°W longitude.
- Lake Martin is a reservoir in Alabama, located near Alexander City, AL. Its approximate coordinates are 32.9444°N latitude and 85.9500°W longitude.

### Step 2: Compare latitudes
- Latitude determines north-south position on Earth. A lower latitude indicates a more southern location, while a higher latitude indicates a more northern location.
- Latitude of Dal-Tex Building (Dallas, TX): approximately 32.7767°N.
- Latitude of Lake Martin (near Alexander City, AL): approximately 32.9444°N.
- Difference in latitude: 32.9444°N - 32.7767°N = 0.1677°N. This means Lake Martin is at a higher latitude by about 0.1677 degrees.
- Since 1 degree of latitude is roughly 111 kilometers (69 miles), this difference corresponds to approximately 18.6 kilometers (11.6 miles) north-south distance, with Lake Martin being north of Dallas.

### Step 3: Consider longitude and directional accuracy
- Longitude of Dal-Tex Building (Dallas): approximately 96.7970°W.
- Longitude of Lake Martin: approximately 85.9500°W.
- Difference in longitude: 96.7970°W - 85.9500°W = 10.8470°W (Dallas is further west by about 10.85 degrees).
- At this latitude (around 33°N), 1 degree of longitude is approximately 93 kilometers (58 miles) due to the Earth's curvature. Thus, the west-east difference is roughly 1,009 kilometers (627 miles).
- The overall direction from Lake Martin to Dallas is southwest, as Dallas is both south (lower latitude) and west (lower longitude) of Lake Martin. However, the question specifically asks about the "south of" relationship, which is confirmed by the latitude comparison.

### Step 4: Conclusion
- Based on the latitude comparison, the Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, TX, is at a lower latitude than Lake Martin in Alabama. Therefore, it is located south of Lake Martin.

**Final Answer: Yes**
