*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Clackamas County, OR located north of Yamhill County, OR?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to recall or know the geographical locations of these counties in Oregon. I'm familiar with Oregon's geography, but I should think this through logically.

Oregon is divided into counties, and I know that Portland is in Multnomah County, which is in the northwest part of the state. Clackamas County is adjacent to Multnomah County, to the south and east. Yamhill County is further south and west, in the Willamette Valley area.

Let me visualize a map of Oregon. The Willamette Valley runs north-south, with Portland at the northern end. Counties from north to south in that area might include:

- Multnomah County (Portland)

- Clackamas County (southeast of Portland)

- Then further south, there's Washington County, Yamhill County, Polk County, etc.

Yamhill County is west of Salem, which is the capital, and Clackamas County is east of Portland.

To determine if Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County, I need to compare their latitudes or general positions.

From memory:

- Clackamas County includes areas like Oregon City, which is south of Portland.

- Yamhill County includes McMinnville, which is southwest of Portland, towards the coast but inland.

Portland is at about 45.5° N latitude. Oregon City (in Clackamas County) is slightly south of Portland, maybe around 45.3° N. McMinnville (in Yamhill County) is further south, probably around 45.2° N or less.

I think McMinnville is south of Oregon City. Let me think about driving directions. If you go from Portland south on I-5, you pass through Clackamas County, then into Marion County (Salem), and Yamhill County is west of that.

Yamhill County is not directly on I-5; it's to the west. So, Clackamas County is east and south of Portland, while Yamhill County is west and south.

But the key is north-south position. Is Clackamas County north of Yamhill County?

Most of Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County. For example, the northern part of Clackamas County is near Portland, while Yamhill County is further south.

Confirming boundaries:

- Clackamas County's northern boundary is with Multnomah and Washington counties.

- Its southern boundary is with Marion and Clackamas counties? No, Clackamas County borders Marion County to the south.

Yamhill County borders Washington County to the north, Polk and Marion to the east, and Tillamook to the west.

So, Washington County is north of Yamhill County. Clackamas County is east of Washington County.

To compare north-south:

- The northernmost point of Yamhill County is probably around 45.4° N or so, while Clackamas County's northern part is around 45.6° N, but its southern part goes down to about 44.8° N or something.

I need average latitudes or something. Perhaps I can think of major cities.

- Oregon City (Clackamas County): approximately 45.35° N

- McMinnville (Yamhill County): approximately 45.21° N

So, 45.35 > 45.21, meaning Oregon City is north of McMinnville.

But counties have area, so I need to see if the entire Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County.

Clackamas County extends south to about the same latitude as Salem or further. Salem is in Marion County, around 44.9° N.

Clackamas County's southern tip might be around 44.8° N, while Yamhill County's northern part is around 45.3° N.

Yamhill County's northern boundary is with Washington County, and Washington County includes Hillsboro, which is west of Portland.

Hillsboro is at about 45.52° N, similar to Portland.

Yamhill County starts south of that. McMinnville is at 45.21° N, but the northern part of Yamhill County might be higher.

Upon second thought, the boundary between Washington and Yamhill counties is around the Tualatin Valley, so probably around 45.3° to 45.4° N.

Clackamas County's western part is near Wilsonville, which is on I-5, south of Portland.

Wilsonville is in Clackamas County, I think, or is it Clackamas or Washington? Wilsonville is in Clackamas County.

Wilsonville is approximately 45.31° N.

McMinnville is 45.21° N, so Wilsonville is north of McMinnville.

But Yamhill County extends north to about the line near Newberg or something.

Newberg is in Yamhill County, I believe, and Newberg is north of McMinnville.

Newberg is at about 45.30° N, similar to Wilsonville.

Wilsonville and Newberg are close in latitude.

But Clackamas County includes areas east, so its eastern parts are at higher elevations but similar latitudes.

To determine if Clackamas County is entirely north of Yamhill County, I need to see if the southernmost point of Clackamas is north of the northernmost point of Yamhill.

Probably not. Let's think.

The southernmost part of Clackamas County is near Estacada or towards Mt. Hood, but in terms of latitude, it might be similar.

Actually, Clackamas County extends south to about 44.5° N or so, while Yamhill County is between 45.0° and 45.3° N approximately.

I think I'm confusing myself.

Let me try to recall standard knowledge.

From memory, driving from Portland south on I-5:

- You start in Multnomah County.

- Then enter Clackamas County (e.g., Milwaukie, Oregon City).

- Then you enter Marion County south of Woodburn or something.

Woodburn is in Marion County, I think. No, let's see: between Portland and Salem, the counties are Clackamas, then Washington County is west, but I-5 goes through Clackamas until about Wilsonville, then it might enter Marion County.

Actually, I-5 from Portland south: it goes through Multnomah, then Clackamas County for a while, and the boundary between Clackamas and Marion counties is south of Wilsonville.

Wilsonville is in Clackamas County, and south of that is Marion County.

Yamhill County is not on I-5; it's to the west. Yamhill County is bordered by Washington County to the north, and its eastern boundary is with Marion County.

So, the northern part of Yamhill County is south of the southern part of Washington County.

Washington County's southern boundary is with Yamhill and Polk counties.

Clackamas County's western boundary is with Washington County, and its southern with Marion.

So, geographically, Clackamas County and Yamhill County do not share a border; they are separated by Washington and Marion counties.

But in terms of north-south, most of Clackamas County is north of most of Yamhill County.

To be precise, the latitude range:

From online knowledge or memory, Clackamas County latitudes range from about 45.6° N in the north to 44.8° N in the south.

Yamhill County latitudes range from about 45.4° N in the north to 44.9° N in the south or something.

I think Yamhill County's northernmost point is around 45.35° N, and southernmost around 45.0° N.

Clackamas County's northernmost is around 45.6° N, southernmost around 44.8° N.

So, the southern part of Clackamas County (44.8° N) is south of the northern part of Yamhill County (45.35° N), so Clackamas County is not entirely north of Yamhill County.

The question is: "Is Clackamas County, OR located north of Yamhill County, OR?"

This could be interpreted as whether Clackamas County is generally or entirely north.

In geographical terms, when we say one county is north of another, we usually mean that it is positioned to the north, but counties can overlap in latitude.

Typically, for such questions, we consider the centroid or the general location.

Perhaps I can think of the county seats.

County seat of Clackamas is Oregon City, at 45.35° N.

County seat of Yamhill is McMinnville, at 45.21° N.

So Oregon City is north of McMinnville.

But is the entire county north? No, as I thought, southern Clackamas is south of northern Yamhill.

But perhaps for practical purposes, Clackamas is north.

I recall that in Oregon, the counties from north to south in the Willamette Valley are: Multnomah, Washington, Clackamas (but Clackamas is east), it's not a straight line.

Perhaps I can think of the western boundaries.

Another way: look at a map mentally.

Portland is north, Clackamas is southeast, Yamhill is southwest.

So, Clackamas is east of Yamhill, but is it north or south?

Since both are south of Portland, but Clackamas is closer to Portland in some parts.

The line of latitude: for the same longitude, Clackamas might be at higher latitude in the west, but lower in the east? No, latitude is north-south, so it's the same for east-west.

Latitude lines are parallel, so for any longitude, the latitude determines north-south position.

So, for Clackamas County, latitudes range from approx 45.6° N to 44.8° N.

For Yamhill County, latitudes range from approx 45.4° N to 45.0° N or 44.9° N.

Upon better recollection, Yamhill County is entirely south of 45.3° N or something.

Let's estimate:

- Northern Yamhill County: near Gaston or Yamhill town, around 45.3° N.

- Southern Yamhill: near Amity, around 45.1° N.

Clackamas: northern part near Portland, 45.6° N, southern part near Estacada, around 45.2° N or less? Estacada is at 45.28° N, I think.

Look up approximate latitudes:

From memory or general knowledge:

- Portland: 45.52° N

- Oregon City (Clackamas seat): 45.35° N

- Wilsonville (Clackamas): 45.31° N

- Southern Clackamas, near Molalla: 45.15° N or so.

Molalla is at 45.14° N.

Now Yamhill:

- Newberg (Yamhill County): 45.30° N

- McMinnville: 45.21° N

- Southern Yamhill, near Willamina: 45.07° N

So, northernmost Yamhill is Newberg at 45.30° N, southernmost Clackamas is, say, Molalla at 45.14° N, which is south of 45.30° N.

45.14 < 45.30, so Molalla is south of Newberg.

Therefore, part of Clackamas County (south) is south of part of Yamhill County (north).

However, the majority of Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County.

But the question is "located north of", which might imply the general position or if it is entirely north.

In common usage, if we say "is County A north of County B", we mean that A is generally to the north of B.

For example, is Washington DC north of Virginia? Well, DC is north of most of Virginia, but not all, but we say yes.

Similarly here, Clackamas is generally north and east of Yamhill.

But to be precise, let's see the centroids.

The centroid of Clackamas County is probably around 45.2° N or so, and Yamhill around 45.2° N as well, but Clackamas might be slightly north.

From the seats: Oregon City 45.35, McMinnville 45.21, so on average, Clackamas is north.

Moreover, in terms of the main areas, Clackamas is closer to Portland, Yamhill is further south.

I think the answer is yes, Clackamas is located north of Yamhill County.

To confirm, I can think of the order: from north to south, counties like Multnomah, then Clackamas and Washington, then Yamhill, Marion, etc.

Washington County is west, and its southern part is adjacent to Yamhill.

But Clackamas is east of Washington, so at the same latitude or slightly south in some parts.

Perhaps it's close, but generally, Clackamas is north.

I found a way: the minimum latitude of Clackamas is lower than the minimum of Yamhill? No, from above, Molalla 45.14, Willamina in Yamhill is 45.07, so southern Clackamas is at 45.14, southern Yamhill at 45.07, so Clackamas southern is north of Yamhill southern? No, 45.14 > 45.07, so Clackamas southern is north of Yamhill southern? Latitude higher means north.

45.14° N is north of 45.07° N, yes.

Latitude increases north, so higher latitude is north.

So, northernmost Yamhill: Newberg 45.30° N

Southernmost Yamhill: let's say 45.05° N or so for Willamina.

Northernmost Clackamas: 45.6° N near Portland.

Southernmost Clackamas: I think near the south, around 44.8° N for the very south, wait no.

Clackamas County extends to the Cascade Range, so south to about 44.8° N for Mt. Hood area, but Mt. Hood is at 45.37° N, wait no.

Mt. Hood is at 45.37° N, but that's not the south; Clackamas County includes areas south.

Clackamas County's southern boundary is with Marion County, and Marion County's north is around 45.0° N for Salem at 44.9° N.

Salem is at 44.91° N, and the boundary between Clackamas and Marion is north of that.

Wilsonville is at 45.31° N in Clackamas, and south of that is still Clackamas until the Marion boundary.

The Marion-Clackamas boundary is around latitude 45.1° N or so.

Upon better recollection, the city of Woodburn is in Marion County at 45.14° N, and it's south of Clackamas.

Clackamas County's southernmost point is around 45.0° N or slightly less.

Let's assume: the latitude of the Clackamas-Marion boundary is approximately 45.1° N.

Yamhill County's northern boundary with Washington County is around 45.3° N.

So, the entire Yamhill County is between 45.0° and 45.4° N, say, and Clackamas is between 44.8° and 45.6° N.

So, there is overlap in latitude.

Specifically, the southern part of Clackamas (44.8-45.1° N) is at the same latitude as southern Yamhill, and northern Clackamas is north.

But for the county as a whole, since Clackamas extends further north, it is generally located north.

However, to answer the question, I think the intended answer is yes, because in common geographical terms, Clackamas County is north of Yamhill County.

I can think of it as: is there any part of Clackamas that is south of Yamhill? Probably not, because Yamhill is west, and their longitudes are different, but latitude-wise, the western part of Clackamas might be at similar latitude as eastern Yamhill.

For example, Wilsonville in Clackamas at 45.31° N, and Newberg in Yamhill at 45.30° N, very close.

But overall, the center of Clackamas is at higher latitude.

Perhaps the best way is to say yes.

I recall that in Oregon, the counties are often listed, and Clackamas is considered north of the central valley counties.

So, I think the answer is yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if Clackamas County, OR is located north of Yamhill County, OR, I will reason step by step based on geographical knowledge of Oregon's counties.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the geographical context**: Oregon's counties are arranged in a grid-like fashion, with the Willamette Valley being a key area in the northwest part of the state. Clackamas County is situated in the northwest, adjacent to Portland (in Multnomah County), while Yamhill County is further south and west, in the Willamette Valley region.

2. **Examine the approximate latitude ranges**:
   - Clackamas County: Latitudes range from approximately 45.6° N in the north (near Portland) to about 45.0° N in the south (near the boundary with Marion County).
   - Yamhill County: Latitudes range from approximately 45.4° N in the north (near the boundary with Washington County) to about 45.0° N in the south (near the boundary with Polk County).
   - Comparing these, there is some overlap in latitude, particularly in the southern part of Clackamas County and the northern part of Yamhill County, both around 45.0° to 45.1° N.

3. **Consider county seats for a reference point**:
   - County seat of Clackamas County: Oregon City, at approximately 45.35° N.
   - County seat of Yamhill County: McMinnville, at approximately 45.21° N.
   - Oregon City is north of McMinnville, indicating that the central areas of Clackamas County are generally north of Yamhill County.

4. **Analyze the overall positioning**:
   - Clackamas County extends further north, reaching up to 45.6° N, while Yamhill County's northernmost point is around 45.4° N.
   - However, the southern parts of both counties overlap in latitude (around 45.0° N), meaning that not every part of Clackamas County is north of every part of Yamhill County.
   - Geographically, Clackamas County is east and slightly north of Yamhill County, but the counties do not share a direct border; they are separated by Washington County to the west and Marion County to the south.

5. **Interpret the question**: The phrase "located north of" typically refers to the general or predominant position in geographical terms. While there is some latitude overlap, the majority of Clackamas County (especially its northern and central areas) is north of Yamhill County. In common usage, such as when describing regional locations, Clackamas County is considered north of Yamhill County.

6. **Conclusion based on reasoning**: Given the latitude comparisons and general positioning, Clackamas County is predominantly located north of Yamhill County.

### Final Answer: Yes
