*********************************** End of Inputs **************************************




*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan located south of WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan?" I need to answer with a yes or no, and show my step-by-step reasoning.

I notice that both locations are specified as being in Manhattan, but Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. Manhattan and Brooklyn are separate boroughs.

Confirming that: Yes, Williamsburg is part of Brooklyn, not Manhattan. So, the question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which might be a mistake. Perhaps it's a typo or misunderstanding. Maybe the user meant Williamsburg Bridge or something else, but as stated, it's "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan."

Now, HILLMAN HOUSES – I believe that's a housing project in Manhattan. Let me recall: Hillman Housing is located in East Harlem, Manhattan. Yes, that's correct. It's on the Upper East Side or East Harlem area.

Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, so if the question is comparing locations in Manhattan to something in Brooklyn, that could be confusing. But the question specifies "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which doesn't exist. Perhaps it's a reference to something else.

Maybe the user meant "Williamsburg" as in the Williamsburg neighborhood, but incorrectly attributed it to Manhattan. Or perhaps it's a place in Manhattan with a similar name. Upon thinking, I don't recall any place called Williamsburg in Manhattan. Manhattan has neighborhoods like Harlem, Chelsea, etc., but not Williamsburg.

Perhaps it's a typo, and they meant "Williamsburg Bridge," which connects Manhattan and Brooklyn. But the question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," not the bridge.

To answer the question as stated, I need to interpret it. If Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, then comparing HILLMAN HOUSES in Manhattan to WILLIAMSBURG in Manhattan doesn't make sense because WILLIAMSBURG isn't in Manhattan.

But let's assume that the user might have meant Williamsburg in Brooklyn, and is asking if Hillman Houses in Manhattan is south of Williamsburg in Brooklyn.

That could be a possibility. Let me think geographically.

First, locate Hillman Houses: It's in East Harlem, Manhattan. East Harlem is around 96th to 125th Street, east of Fifth Avenue.

Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, north of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, and it's across the East River from Manhattan.

Now, if we're talking about north-south direction, Manhattan is generally north of Brooklyn in terms of the island's orientation, but since Williamsburg is directly across the river from Lower Manhattan and parts of Midtown, I need to think about the relative positions.

Actually, Brooklyn is south and east of Manhattan. Manhattan island runs north-south, with Lower Manhattan at the southern tip and Upper Manhattan at the north.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is located opposite the Lower East Side of Manhattan. So, if you look at a map, Williamsburg is roughly southeast of Manhattan's Lower East Side.

Hillman Houses are in Upper East Harlem, which is in northern Manhattan, around 100th Street or so.

So, is Upper Manhattan south of Williamsburg, Brooklyn?

No. Upper Manhattan is north of Lower Manhattan, and Williamsburg is south of Lower Manhattan across the river.

Let's think about latitude.

Manhattan's southern tip is around 40.70° N, and northern tip around 40.88° N.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is roughly at similar latitudes to Lower Manhattan. For example, the Williamsburg Bridge connects to Delancey Street in Manhattan, which is in Lower East Side.

Delancey Street is around 74th Street? No, Manhattan's street grid: Houston Street is around 100, but actually, streets in Lower Manhattan are not numbered the same.

Standard: Lower Manhattan has streets like Canal Street, Houston, etc., then uptown starts with numbered streets from Houston northward, but Houston is not numbered; 1st Street is north of Houston.

Perhaps better to think in terms of cross streets.

Williamsburg Bridge lands in Manhattan at Delancey Street, which is between Houston and Canal, so lower part.

Latitude-wise, northern Manhattan (Harlem) is farther north than southern Manhattan and Williamsburg.

Approximate latitudes:

- Southern tip of Manhattan: about 40.70° N

- Central Park (Midtown): about 40.77° N

- Harlem (125th St): about 40.81° N

- Williamsburg, Brooklyn: the area around the bridge is around 40.71° N, similar to Lower East Side.

Upon quick mental recall, Lower East Side Manhattan is around 40.71-40.72° N, and Williamsburg is very close, perhaps slightly south or same.

Actually, Brooklyn's Williamsburg is at similar latitude to Lower Manhattan. For example, the Brooklyn Bridge is at about 40.706° N, and Williamsburg is a bit north of that, say 40.71-40.72° N.

Harlem in Manhattan, 125th Street, is about 40.81° N.

So, Harlem (where Hillman Houses are) is at higher latitude (farther north) than Williamsburg.

Therefore, Hillman Houses in northern Manhattan are north of Williamsburg in Brooklyn.

But the question is: is Hillman Houses south of Williamsburg?

If Hillman Houses are north, then it's not south.

But the question specifies "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which is confusing.

Perhaps the user meant a place in Manhattan called Williamsburg, but I don't think there is one.

Maybe it's a housing project or something. Upon thinking, there's no Williamsburg in Manhattan.

Another thought: perhaps "Williamsburg" is a misnomer, and they meant something else, like Washington Heights or whatever.

But to answer based on standard knowledge.

If I take Williamsburg as in Brooklyn, then Hillman Houses in Manhattan are not south of Williamsburg; they are north of it, since Harlem is north of the area opposite Williamsburg.

To be precise: from Williamsburg, looking north, you have Lower East Side, then Midtown, then Upper East Side and Harlem.

So Hillman Houses are north of Williamsburg.

Therefore, it is not south.

But the question says "south of WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan." Since WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan doesn't exist, perhaps I should say no, because there's no such place, or interpret it.

Maybe in the context, WILLIAMSBURG refers to a street or something in Manhattan.

Upon second thought, there might be a Williamsburg Road or something, but I doubt it.

Perhaps it's a typo, and they meant "Washington Heights" or "Williamsbridge," but Williamsbridge is in the Bronx, not Manhattan.

Williamsbridge is a neighborhood in the Bronx.

So, probably, the user meant Williamsburg in Brooklyn.

Given that, and the question is about location, I think the intended comparison is between Hillman Houses in Manhattan and Williamsburg in Brooklyn.

In that case, is Hillman Houses south of Williamsburg? No, because Hillman Houses are in northern Manhattan, while Williamsburg is in northwestern Brooklyn, so geographically, Hillman Houses are north and slightly west, but in terms of north-south, they are north.

To confirm with directions: If you go from Williamsburg to Hillman Houses, you go north across the East River into Manhattan and uptown.

So, Hillman Houses are north of Williamsburg.

Therefore, it is not south.

So the answer should be no.

But to be thorough, let's assume the question has a mistake, and WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan doesn't exist, so strictly speaking, the comparison doesn't make sense, but based on common sense, I'll go with no.

Perhaps there's a place called Hillman Houses and Williamsburg in Manhattan, but I don't think so.

Another idea: maybe "WILLIAMSBURG" is meant to be "Williamsburg Houses," which is a NYCHA development in Brooklyn, specifically in Williamsburg.

Yes, that's likely.

Hillman Houses are in Manhattan.

So, same issue.

Final reasoning: Hillman Houses are located in East Harlem, Manhattan, which is in the northern part of Manhattan. Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, south of Manhattan in terms of the boroughs, but since Williamsburg is opposite Lower Manhattan, and Hillman Houses are in Upper Manhattan, Hillman Houses are actually north of Williamsburg.

Therefore, it is not located south of Williamsburg.

So the answer is no.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
The query asks whether Hillman Houses in Manhattan is located south of Williamsburg in Manhattan. However, there is an issue with the location specified for Williamsburg. Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. There is no known neighborhood or significant landmark called Williamsburg in Manhattan. This suggests a possible error in the query, such as a typo or misunderstanding.

Assuming the query intended to compare Hillman Houses in Manhattan to Williamsburg in Brooklyn (the actual location), I will proceed with a geographical analysis based on standard New York City geography:

1. **Locate Hillman Houses**: Hillman Houses is a New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) development located in East Harlem, Manhattan. East Harlem is in the northern part of Manhattan, roughly between 96th and 125th Streets, with an approximate latitude of 40.80°–40.82° N.

2. **Locate Williamsburg**: Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, situated along the East River. It is northwest Brooklyn, with an approximate latitude of 40.71°–40.73° N. It is directly across the East River from the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

3. **Compare north-south positions**:
   - Latitude is a key indicator for north-south direction. Higher latitude means farther north.
   - Hillman Houses (around 40.80°–40.82° N) has a higher latitude than Williamsburg (around 40.71°–40.73° N).
   - This means Hillman Houses is north of Williamsburg, not south.

4. **Address the Manhattan specification**: Since Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, the direct comparison in the query as stated ("WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan") is not possible. If the query meant Williamsburg in Brooklyn, the analysis above applies. If it referred to something else in Manhattan (e.g., a street or minor landmark), no such prominent location exists based on standard geographic knowledge.

Based on the geographical evidence, if we interpret Williamsburg as being in Brooklyn, Hillman Houses is not located south of it. Therefore, the answer is no. If the query contains an error and refers to a different location, clarification would be needed for a more accurate response.
