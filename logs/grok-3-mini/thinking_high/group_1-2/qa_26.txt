*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is 97233, OR located west of 98580, WA?" I need to determine if the location with ZIP code 97233 in Oregon is west of the location with ZIP code 98580 in Washington. I must show my step-by-step reasoning and end with a yes or no answer.

ZIP codes are used in the US to denote geographic areas, but they don't directly give longitude and latitude. However, I can use general knowledge of the states and perhaps approximate locations based on common knowledge or standard geography.

Oregon (OR) is on the West Coast, and Washington (WA) is directly north of Oregon. Both states are in the Pacific Northwest region of the US.

Specifically:

- Washington state is bordered by Oregon to the south, so generally, locations in Washington are north of locations in Oregon. But the question is about east-west direction: is 97233, OR west of 98580, WA?

The key is to find out the relative east-west positions. Since Washington is north of Oregon, but within the states, different parts could be east or west.

I need to know where these ZIP codes are located.

Let me recall or estimate the locations:

- ZIP code 97233: I think this is in Oregon. Portland, Oregon has ZIP codes starting with 972. Yes, 972 is the prefix for Portland area. So 97233 is likely in or near Portland, Oregon.

- ZIP code 98580: This is in Washington. I think 985 is for western Washington. Olympia, the capital, has ZIP codes around 985. Yes, 98580 might be in or near Olympia, WA.

Confirming approximate locations:

- Portland, OR is in the northwest part of Oregon, near the Columbia River.

- Olympia, WA is in western Washington, also near the Puget Sound area.

Now, both cities are on the west side of their respective states.

To determine if Portland, OR is west of Olympia, WA.

Washington state extends further west than Oregon in some parts. Let's think about longitude.

I know that the Pacific Ocean is west, so both are on the west coast, but their longitudes might differ.

Recalling approximate longitudes:

- Portland, OR is around 122.5° W longitude.

- Seattle, WA is around 122.3° W, and Olympia is south of Seattle, so probably similar longitude, maybe a bit west or east.

Olympia is west of Seattle. Seattle is at about 122.3° W, and Olympia is at about 122.9° W or something? I need to be careful.

Actually, I think both are very close in longitude.

Let me think geographically:

- The Cascade Range runs north-south through both states, dividing them into west and east sides.

- Portland is west of the Cascades, in the Willamette Valley.

- Olympia is also west of the Cascades, in the Puget Sound lowlands.

Now, comparing their positions:

- Portland, OR is at approximately 45.5° N latitude and 122.6° W longitude.

- Olympia, WA is at approximately 47.0° N latitude and 122.9° W longitude.

I should verify these.

From memory:

- Portland: longitude is about 122.68° W.

- Olympia: I think it's around 122.90° W.

If Olympia is at 122.90° W and Portland at 122.68° W, that would mean Portland is east of Olympia because higher west longitude means further west? No.

Longitude increases westward, so 122.90° W is west of 122.68° W? No.

Longitude is measured from the Prime Meridian, so west longitude: a higher number means further west.

For example, 123° W is west of 122° W.

Standard longitude: 122.68° W vs 122.90° W.

122.90° W is 122 degrees and 54 minutes west, while 122.68° W is 122 degrees and 40.8 minutes west. Since 0.90 is greater than 0.68, 122.90° W is further west than 122.68° W.

Let's clarify:

- 122.68° W means 122 degrees and 0.68 * 60 minutes ≈ 40.8 minutes west.

- 122.90° W means 122 degrees and 0.90 * 60 = 54 minutes west.

So 122° 54' W vs 122° 40.8' W. Since 54' > 40.8', 122.90° W is further west than 122.68° W.

But that would suggest Olympia at 122.90° W is west of Portland at 122.68° W.

I think I have the longitudes wrong.

Let me recall accurately.

Actually, I think Portland is at about 122.67° W, and Seattle is at 122.33° W, no.

Seattle is at approximately 122.33° W longitude.

Longitude decreases as you go east, but since it's west, higher number is west.

Standard: Greenwich is 0°, east is positive, west is negative, but we say degrees west.

So, for example, New York is about 74° W, Los Angeles is about 118° W, so higher number means further west in the western hemisphere.

118° W is west of 74° W.

Now, for Pacific Northwest:

- Seattle, WA is approximately 122.33° W.

- Portland, OR is slightly south and a bit east or west?

Portland is east of Seattle in terms of longitude.

The Cascade Mountains: east of Cascades is drier, west is wetter.

Seattle is on the west side, Portland is also on the west side but in a different valley.

Upon thinking, I believe Portland is at about 122.68° W, and Seattle is at 122.33° W, so 122.33° W is less than 122.68° W? 122.33 is 122 degrees 20 minutes, 122.68 is 122 degrees 40.8 minutes, so 122.68° W is further west than 122.33° W? No.

122.33° W means 122 degrees and 0.33*60 = 19.8 minutes west.

122.68° W means 122 degrees and 40.8 minutes west.

Since both are west, and 122.68 > 122.33, so 122.68° W is further west than 122.33° W.

But I think Seattle is west of Portland? No, I think it's the opposite.

I think I have it backward.

Let me think: the International Date Line is at 180°, but in US, lower longitude numbers are east, higher are west, but within a small area.

Actually, longitude increases as you go west.

For example, Boston is 71° W, Chicago is 87° W, Denver is 105° W, San Francisco is 122° W, so yes, higher degree means further west.

Now, Seattle and Portland: I believe Seattle is at approximately 122.3° W, and Portland is at 122.7° W or something.

Upon second thought, I think Portland is east of Seattle.

No: let's think about the map. The Strait of Juan de Fuca is west, Puget Sound, then Cascades.

Seattle is on Puget Sound, Portland is on the Columbia River, which is south.

I think longitudinally, Portland is slightly east of Seattle.

Recall: Seattle longitude is about 122.33° W, Portland is about 122.68° W? That would mean Portland is west, but I think it's east.

I must have it wrong.

I remember that the Cascade Range has a longitude around 121-122° W.

Perhaps I can think of cities.

Vancouver, BC is at 123° W, Seattle is east of that, around 122.3° W, and Portland is south, but I think Portland is at similar longitude or slightly east.

Upon thinking, I believe Portland, OR is at approximately 122.65° W, and Seattle, WA is at 122.33° W, but 122.65 > 122.33, so Portland would be further west, but that can't be right because Seattle is north and slightly west or east.

I think Seattle is at 122.33° W, and Portland is at 122.68° W, but let's confirm with known facts.

I know that the distance between Seattle and Portland is about 175 miles south, and longitudinally, Portland is a bit east.

Upon correction, I think Seattle is at 122.33° W, and Portland is at 122.58° W or something. No.

Let's think about it: the Columbia River mouth is at about 124° W, and Portland is inland, Seattle is on Puget Sound.

Actually, upon standard knowledge, Portland, OR longitude is approximately 122.68° W, and Seattle, WA is approximately 122.35° W. 122.68 > 122.35, so 122.68° W is further west.

But I think in reality, Seattle is west of Portland? No, I think Portland is east of Seattle.

I'm confusing myself.

Let me think differently. I can recall that the Cascade Mountains run north-south, and both cities are west of the Cascades, but their longitudes.

Perhaps I can use the fact that Olympia is south of Seattle.

Olympia, WA is the capital, located at the southern end of Puget Sound.

Olympia longitude is approximately 122.90° W.

I think Olympia is at about 122.9° W, and Portland is at 122.7° W.

Let's assume I look it up in my mind: Portland, OR is at 45.52° N, 122.68° W.

Olympia, WA is at 47.04° N, 122.90° W.

Yes, that's standard.

So, longitude of Portland: 122.68° W

Longitude of Olympia: 122.90° W

Since longitude is measured west, a higher numerical value means further west.

So, 122.90° W is west of 122.68° W.

Therefore, Olympia, WA is west of Portland, OR.

But the ZIP codes are 97233 and 98580.

97233 is in Portland area? Let me confirm the ZIP code locations.

97233: I believe 97233 is a ZIP code in Portland, Oregon. Specifically, it might be in east Portland or something, but generally in the Portland metro area.

98580: I think 98580 is in Washington. Let me recall, 985 is for Thurston County, which includes Olympia. ZIP code 98580 might be specific, but likely near Olympia.

Upon quick search in memory, 98580 is for Rainier, WA or something, but I think it's in the Olympia area.

Assuming 97233 is in Portland, OR, longitude around 122.6-122.7° W.

For 98580, WA: if it's Olympia area, longitude around 122.9° W.

But earlier I said Olympia is at 122.90° W, Portland at 122.68° W.

122.90 > 122.68, so 122.90° W is further west.

Therefore, a location at 122.90° W (Olympia) is west of a location at 122.68° W (Portland).

So, 98580, WA (near Olympia) is west of 97233, OR (near Portland).

But the question is: is 97233, OR located west of 98580, WA?

So, is Portland west of Olympia?

From above, Portland is at 122.68° W, Olympia at 122.90° W, so Portland has smaller longitude number, meaning it's east of Olympia.

Longitude west: smaller number means closer to the Prime Meridian in the west, so east.

For west longitude, a smaller numerical value means closer to 0° (east), higher numerical value means further west.

So, 122.68° W vs 122.90° W: 122.68 is less than 122.90, so 122.68° W is east of 122.90° W.

Yes: for example, 120° W is east of 130° W.

So, Portland at 122.68° W is east of Olympia at 122.90° W.

Therefore, 97233, OR (Portland area) is east of 98580, WA (Olympia area), not west.

But is 98580 exactly Olympia? Let me confirm the ZIP code.

Upon thinking, ZIP code 98580 might not be Olympia. Olympia ZIP is 98501 or something.

I need to be precise.

Since the question might expect general knowledge, but to be accurate.

Assuming standard locations.

Perhaps both ZIP codes are close, but generally.

Another way: Washington state extends further west to the Olympic Peninsula, while Oregon's westernmost is the coast.

Olympia is on the Puget Sound, which is indented, so it might be further west.

From memory, the longitude:

- Portland, OR: approximately 122.68° W

- Olympia, WA: approximately 122.89° W (I think it's around there)

Yes, so Olympia is at higher longitude west, so further west.

Therefore, any point in Portland is east of points in Olympia.

But ZIP codes might vary.

For 97233: I believe 97233 is in Portland, specifically in the Gresham area or east Portland, which might be slightly east.

Portland ZIP 97233 is in east Portland, perhaps around 122.55° W or something, but still around there.

Actually, upon better recall, the average longitude for Portland is 122.68° W, but eastern parts might be slightly east.

Similarly, for 98580, WA: looking it up in mind, I think 98580 is for the town of Tenino or something in Thurston County, WA.

Thurston County includes Olympia, and longitudes range, but generally around 122.8-123° W.

Assuming it's similar to Olympia.

To be precise, perhaps I can assume the central locations.

Since both are in the western parts, but Olympia is further west.

Another way: the straight line between Portland and Olympia.

Portland is southeast of Olympia.

Olympia is north-northwest of Portland.

From Portland to Seattle, it's north, but Seattle is slightly west, Olympia is south of Seattle but still west.

Distance-wise, Portland to Olympia is about 100 miles north, and Olympia is west of Portland.

Longitude difference: difference of about 0.22 degrees, which is significant.

Each degree of longitude at that latitude (around 45-47°N) is about 111 km * cos(latitude) ≈ 111 * cos(45) ≈ 111 * 0.707 ≈ 78.5 km per degree.

So, difference between 122.68 and 122.90 is 0.22 degrees.

0.22 * 78.5 ≈ 17.27 km, so about 10-11 miles.

So, Olympia is about 11 miles west of Portland in longitude, but since they are at different latitudes, the actual direction.

Portland at 45.5°N, Olympia at 47°N, so difference in latitude is about 1.5 degrees, which is 1.5 * 111 km ≈ 166.5 km north.

So, Olympia is north and slightly west of Portland.

Therefore, in terms of east-west, Olympia is west of Portland.

Hence, a location in Olympia is west of a location in Portland.

Therefore, 98580, WA (assuming near Olympia) is west of 97233, OR (near Portland).

So, is 97233, OR west of 98580, WA? No, because Portland is east of Olympia.

The question is: is 97233, OR located west of 98580, WA?

If 97233 is in Portland and 98580 is in Olympia area, and Portland is east of Olympia, then no, it's not west.

But to confirm the exact ZIP codes.

Perhaps 97233 is specifically located.

Upon quick search in memory, ZIP code 97233 is in Portland, Oregon, specifically in the area east of downtown Portland, perhaps around 45.51°N, 122.49°W or something.

I can assume average.

98580, WA: I think 98580 is for the city of Rainier, Washington, which is southeast of Olympia.

Rainier, WA is in Thurston County, and its longitude might be different.

Upon thinking, Olympia is at 122.90°W, Rainier might be east of that.

Perhaps 98580 is not as far west.

Let me think: ZIP code 98580 might be for an area with different longitude.

To be accurate, I should consider that both states are close, but generally.

Since the question likely expects a simple answer based on state positions, but Washington and Oregon both span similar longitudes.

Oregon's westernmost is about 124.5°W, easternmost 117°W, Washington similar, westernmost 124.7°W, easternmost 117°W.

But specific cities.

I could use online knowledge or standard assumption.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll go with the initial thought.

So, typically, Portland is east of Olympia in longitude.

Therefore, 97233, OR is not west of 98580, WA; it's east.

So the answer should be no.

But to confirm, let's assume the longitudes.

Suppose 97233: Portland area, say 122.5° W average.

98580: if it's Rainier, WA, I think Rainier is at about 122.7° W or something.

Upon better recall, Olympia is at 122.90°W, and Rainier, WA is southeast, so probably east of Olympia.

For example, if Rainier is at higher latitude but possibly east.

Longitude of Rainier, WA: I think it's around 122.70°W or less.

Actually, upon thinking, Thurston County longitudes range from about 122.5° W to 123° W or something.

Olympia is western part, so 122.9°W, eastern part might be 122.7°W or so.

Similarly, Portland ZIP 97233 might be in east Portland, which could be around 122.55°W.

For instance, Gresham, OR (near 97233) is at about 122.43°W.

97233 is likely in the area of east Portland, perhaps Mount Hood Community College area, longitude around 122.52°W.

For 98580, WA: ZIP code 98580 is for Rainier, WA, which is at approximately 46.88°N, 122.70°W.

Rainier, WA longitude is about 122.69°W.

Portland area 97233: let's say 45.52°N, 122.52°W (approximate for east Portland).

So, 97233 at 122.52°W, 98580 at 122.69°W.

122.69 > 122.52, so 122.69°W is further west.

Thus, 98580 is west of 97233.

Therefore, 97233 is east of 98580, not west.

So, is 97233, OR located west of 98580, WA? No.

Final answer is no.

To be precise, based on approximate coordinates:

- 97233, OR: around 122.52°W

- 98580, WA: around 122.69°W

Difference: 0.17 degrees, so 98580 is west.

Hence, 97233 is not west of it.

So, answer is no.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if the location with ZIP code 97233 in Oregon (OR) is located west of the location with ZIP code 98580 in Washington (WA), I will use geographic reasoning based on approximate longitude values, as ZIP codes correspond to specific areas and longitude helps determine east-west positioning. Longitude is measured in degrees west (W), and a higher numerical value indicates a position further west in the Western Hemisphere.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the approximate locations of the ZIP codes:**
   - ZIP code 97233 is in Oregon, specifically in the Portland area. More precisely, it is associated with eastern Portland or nearby areas like Gresham. Based on standard geographic data, the approximate longitude for this ZIP code is around 122.52° W.
   - ZIP code 98580 is in Washington, specifically in the town of Rainier, which is in Thurston County near Olympia. The approximate longitude for this ZIP code is around 122.69° W.

2. **Compare the longitudes:**
   - Longitude of 97233, OR: approximately 122.52° W.
   - Longitude of 98580, WA: approximately 122.69° W.
   - In the Western Hemisphere, a higher longitude value (e.g., 122.69° W) indicates a position further west compared to a lower value (e.g., 122.52° W). Therefore, 122.69° W (98580, WA) is west of 122.52° W (97233, OR).

3. **Determine the relative position:**
   - Since 98580, WA has a higher longitude value, it is located west of 97233, OR.
   - The question asks if 97233, OR is located west of 98580, WA. Based on the longitude comparison, 97233, OR is actually east of 98580, WA, not west.

4. **Consider potential variations:**
   - ZIP code boundaries can vary slightly, and exact coordinates might differ marginally. However, based on standard approximations and the general area, the conclusion holds that 97233, OR is east of 98580, WA.
   - The longitude difference is about 0.17 degrees, which corresponds to roughly 13-14 kilometers (8-9 miles) at this latitude, confirming a noticeable east-west separation.

### Final Answer:
No
