*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI located west of The Ort Institute, IL?" I need to answer with a simple Yes or No, but show my step-by-step reasoning.

To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their geographical positions, specifically their longitude. West means a lower longitude value in the standard coordinate system where longitude increases eastward from the Prime Meridian.

So, I need the locations of:

- University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan in Sheboygan, Wisconsin (WI)

- The Ort Institute in Illinois (IL). I'm not familiar with "The Ort Institute, IL." It might be a typo or less known. Perhaps it's meant to be a place in Illinois. Let me think: could it be "The Art Institute" or something similar? Upon second thought, I recall there's an Art Institute of Chicago in Illinois. Maybe it's a misspelling or autocorrect for "Art Institute." I'll assume it's the Art Institute of Chicago for this purpose, as it's a well-known institution in IL. If it's not, I might need to clarify, but based on common knowledge, I'll proceed with that.

So, locations:

- University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan: In Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

- The Ort Institute: Assuming it's the Art Institute of Chicago, Illinois.

Now, I need their approximate longitudes.

Recall general geography of the US:

- Wisconsin is in the Midwest, bordering Lake Michigan.

- Illinois is also in the Midwest, with Chicago on the western shore of Lake Michigan.

Sheboygan, Wisconsin, is on the eastern side of Wisconsin, right on Lake Michigan. Chicago, Illinois, is directly south of that, also on Lake Michigan.

Both are on the same lake, but Sheboygan is north of Chicago.

- Chicago is at approximately 41.8781° N latitude and 87.6298° W longitude.

- Sheboygan, Wisconsin: I think it's around 43.7508° N latitude and 87.7145° W longitude. Let me confirm that.

I should use approximate values.

From memory:

- Chicago, IL: Longitude is about 87.6° W.

- Sheboygan, WI: Sheboygan is slightly west of Chicago in terms of longitude? No.

Lake Michigan runs north-south. Cities on the west side of the lake would have similar longitudes.

Chicago is on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan, so its longitude is around 87.6° W.

Sheboygan is on the eastern shore of Wisconsin, which is the western side of Lake Michigan. Wisconsin's eastern border is Lake Michigan, so Sheboygan should have a longitude close to Chicago's.

But let's think: as you go north along Lake Michigan, the longitude might change slightly.

Typically, moving north or south along a meridian keeps the same longitude, but Lake Michigan is not perfectly north-south; it's slightly diagonal.

Generally, Sheboygan is north of Chicago, and since the lake curves, but both are on the same approximate meridian.

I think Chicago is at 87.6298° W, and Sheboygan is at about 87.7145° W. That means Sheboygan has a slightly higher longitude value (more west, since west longitudes increase numerically as you go west).

Longitude is measured from 0 to 180 west or east. In the US, it's all west, so higher numbers mean further west.

Standard longitude: 0° at Greenwich, increases east to 180° and west to 180°. So in the western hemisphere, longitude is negative or denoted as W, with values from 0° to 180° W.

So, a higher degree west means further west.

For example, New York is around 74° W, Chicago is around 87° W, so Chicago is west of New York.

Now, comparing Chicago and Sheboygan:

- Chicago, IL: Approx. 87.63° W

- Sheboygan, WI: Let me recall or estimate. Sheboygan is directly north of Chicago along the lake. Looking at a map in my mind, Sheboygan is at about 87.71° W.

Upon thinking, I believe Sheboygan's longitude is slightly west of Chicago's.

Chicago is at 87.6298° W, and Sheboygan is at 87.7145° W. Yes, 87.7145 > 87.6298, so Sheboygan has a higher longitude value, meaning it's further west.

Is that accurate? Let me double-check my memory.

Actually, Lake Michigan's western shore: Chicago is at the southern end, and as you go north, the longitude might increase slightly if the lake curves.

Upon second thought, I think Chicago and Milwaukee are close, and Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee.

Milwaukee, WI, is at about 87.9065° W longitude.

Standard knowledge:

- Chicago, IL: 87.6298° W

- Milwaukee, WI: Approximately 87.907° W (which is west of Chicago)

87.907 > 87.6298, so Milwaukee is west of Chicago.

Longitude increases westward, so higher W longitude means further west.

Chicago is at 87.63° W, Milwaukee is at 87.91° W, so Milwaukee is slightly west of Chicago.

Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee, along the lake.

Sheboygan's longitude: I think it's around 87.71° W. Let me think.

Upon recollection, Sheboygan, WI, is at approximately 87.714° W latitude? No, longitude.

Coordinates: Sheboygan is at 43.75° N, 87.71° W.

Yes, approximately 87.71° W.

Chicago is at 87.63° W.

So, 87.71° W vs 87.63° W.

Since 87.71 > 87.63, Sheboygan has a higher longitude value, meaning it's further west.

In the western hemisphere, a higher degree west means more west. For example, 90° W is west of 80° W.

So, 87.71° W is west of 87.63° W.

87.71 is greater than 87.63, so yes, Sheboygan is at a higher longitude, so it's west of Chicago.

But intuitively, both are on Lake Michigan, Chicago is south, Sheboygan is north. Since the lake runs roughly north-south, but there's a slight westward trend as you go north.

Yes, from Chicago to Milwaukee to Sheboygan, you're moving slightly west as well as north.

So, Sheboygan, WI, is west of Chicago, IL.

Longitude of Chicago: 87.6298° W

Longitude of Sheboygan: 87.7145° W (confirming online or from memory, but I'll assume it's correct).

Difference: 87.7145 - 87.6298 = 0.0847° west, so yes, Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

The question is: Is University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan west of The Ort Institute, IL?

Assuming The Ort Institute is in Chicago, IL, then since Sheboygan is west of Chicago, the answer should be yes.

But is The Ort Institute actually in Chicago? I assumed it's the Art Institute, but let's confirm.

Upon thinking, "The Ort Institute" might not be standard. Perhaps it's a typo. Maybe it's "The Art Institute" or something else. In the context, it could be a fictional or less known place, but for reasoning, I'll stick with Chicago as a proxy for Illinois, but specifically, the institute is likely in a city.

Perhaps "Ort" is a misspelling of "Art." I'll proceed with that.

If it's not specified, but since it's "IL," it's in Illinois, and probably a major city.

But to be precise, let's assume it's in Chicago for this purpose.

So, if Sheboygan is at 87.71° W and Chicago at 87.63° W, then Sheboygan is west.

But is that correct? 87.71° W is more west than 87.63° W? No:

Longitude: smaller number means closer to the Prime Meridian, so east, larger number means west.

87.63° W is less west than 87.71° W? No:

Degrees west: 87.63° W means 87.63 degrees west of Greenwich.

87.71° W is 87.71 degrees west, which is further west because 87.71 > 87.63.

Yes, so 87.71° W is west of 87.63° W.

For example, 90° W is west of 80° W.

So, Sheboygan at 87.71° W is west of Chicago at 87.63° W.

But I think I have the numbers wrong.

Let me double-check standard longitudes.

Upon second thought, I recall that Chicago is at approximately 87.6° W, and Milwaukee is at 87.9° W, which is slightly west.

Sheboygan: let's think about it.

Actually, looking it up in my mind: Chicago longitude is 87.6298° W.

Milwaukee is 87.907° W.

Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee. What is Sheboygan's longitude?

I think Sheboygan is at about 87.714° W, but that can't be right because Milwaukee is at 87.907° W, and Sheboygan is further north but might be slightly east or west.

Perhaps I have it wrong.

Let me think logically: Lake Michigan's western shore longitudes.

Chicago: 87.63° W

As you go north along the Wisconsin side, to Kenosha, Racine, Milwaukee, etc.

Milwaukee is at 43.0389° N, 87.9065° W.

Sheboygan is at 43.7533° N, 87.7186° W. I think it's 87.7186° W.

87.7186° W for Sheboygan vs 87.6298° W for Chicago.

87.7186 > 87.6298, so Sheboygan is at a higher longitude value, thus further west.

Yes.

To confirm, the difference is small, but Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

Now, the question is about west of, so if Sheboygan is west of Chicago, then yes.

But the institute is "The Ort Institute, IL," which I assumed is in Chicago. But Illinois is a state, so it could be anywhere in Illinois.

For example, if the institute is in western Illinois, say in Quincy or something, it could have a higher longitude, like 91° W, which would be west of Sheboygan.

That's a point. The question says "The Ort Institute, IL," but doesn't specify the city. So, it could be anywhere in Illinois.

Illinois spans from about 87.5° W in the east (Chicago area) to about 91.5° W in the west (near the Mississippi River).

Wisconsin, Sheboygan is at 87.71° W.

So, if the institute is in eastern Illinois, like Chicago, then Sheboygan is west.

But if it's in western Illinois, say in a city like Rock Island, which is at about 90.58° W, then Sheboygan at 87.71° W is east of that, so not west.

Problem: the location is not specified.

In the context, "The Ort Institute, IL" might imply a specific known place, or perhaps it's meant to be in a major city.

Perhaps "Ort" is a typo, and it's "Art Institute," which is in Chicago.

Maybe it's "The Illinois Institute of Technology" or something, but likely in Chicago.

To be precise, I should assume it's in Chicago, as it's the most prominent.

But to be thorough, let's see the question: "The Ort Institute, IL" – perhaps it's fictional, but for reasoning, I'll assume it's in Illinois, and since no specific location, but the way it's phrased, probably meant to be comparable.

Perhaps in the context of the user, it's known, but since it's not, I'll go with the common assumption.

Another thought: "Ort" might be "ORT," which could be something else, but I think it's safe to assume Chicago.

So, with that, Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

Longitude Sheboygan: 87.71° W

Chicago: 87.63° W

Difference: Sheboygan is at higher longitude, so west.

Yes.

To confirm with latitude, but longitude is what matters for east-west.

So, answer should be Yes.

But let's make sure about the institute.

Perhaps "The Ort Institute" is not real. Upon quick search in my knowledge, I don't recall it, so likely a typo for "Art Institute."

Maybe it's "The Oriental Institute" in Chicago, which is part of the University of Chicago.

Yes, the Oriental Institute is in Chicago, IL.

So, same location.

Thus, it's in Chicago.

So, University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is west of The Ort Institute (assuming Chicago).

Final answer: Yes.

But to be precise, step-by-step:

1. Identify locations: University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

2. The Ort Institute is likely a misspelling or reference to an institute in Illinois, probably Chicago.

3. Approximate longitudes: Sheboygan, WI: ~87.71° W; Chicago, IL: ~87.63° W.

4. Since 87.71° W > 87.63° W, Sheboygan is further west.

5. Therefore, it is located west of the institute.

Answer: Yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI, is located west of The Ort Institute, IL, I will compare their geographical positions based on longitude, as east-west direction is determined by longitude values (with higher west longitude values indicating further west in the Western Hemisphere).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations:**
   - The University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Its approximate coordinates are 43.7533° N, 87.7186° W.
   - The Ort Institute, IL, is not a widely recognized institution in my knowledge base. It may be a typo or less common reference. Based on common assumptions, it could be intended to refer to a prominent institute in Illinois, such as the Art Institute of Chicago or the Oriental Institute (both located in Chicago, IL). For this analysis, I will assume it is in Chicago, IL, with approximate coordinates of 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W. If this assumption is incorrect, the result could vary depending on the exact location in Illinois.

2. **Focus on longitude for east-west comparison:**
   - Longitude is measured in degrees west (W) in the US, with higher values indicating further west.
   - Sheboygan, WI: Longitude ≈ 87.7186° W.
   - Chicago, IL (assumed location for The Ort Institute): Longitude ≈ 87.6298° W.

3. **Compare the longitude values:**
   - Sheboygan's longitude (87.7186° W) is greater than Chicago's longitude (87.6298° W).
   - A higher west longitude value means Sheboygan is further west than Chicago.
   - The difference is approximately 0.0888° (87.7186 - 87.6298), confirming Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

4. **Consider potential variations:**
   - If The Ort Institute is not in Chicago but in another part of Illinois, the result could change. For example:
     - Eastern Illinois (e.g., near Chicago) has longitudes around 87.5–88° W, so Sheboygan would still be west.
     - Western Illinois (e.g., near the Mississippi River, like Quincy at ~91.4° W) has higher longitudes, so Sheboygan would be east, not west.
   - However, based on the assumption that "The Ort Institute, IL" likely refers to a Chicago-based institution (due to lack of specificity and common knowledge), the comparison holds.

5. **Conclusion based on assumption:**
   - Under the reasonable assumption that The Ort Institute is in Chicago, IL, Sheboygan, WI, is located west of it.

### Final Answer: Yes
