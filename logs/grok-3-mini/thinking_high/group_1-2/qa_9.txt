*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: Did William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey die later than Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy? I need to answer with Yes or No, and show my step-by-step reasoning.

I need to find out the death years of both individuals. That will allow me to compare them.

Start with William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. I recall he was a Norman nobleman involved in the Norman Conquest. I think he died in 1088. Let me confirm that. Yes, from my knowledge, William de Warenne died on June 24, 1088.

Now, Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy. She was married to Peter I of Savoy. I need her death year. I think she died in 1097. Let me make sure. Upon thinking, Agnes of Aquitaine was the daughter of William VIII, Duke of Aquitaine, and she married Peter I of Savoy. Her death year is around 1097. I should double-check.

I need accurate dates. Let me recall:

- William de Warenne: Born around 1030-1040, died 1088.

- Agnes of Aquitaine: She was born around 1059, and died in 1097.

If William died in 1088 and Agnes in 1097, then yes, William died later than Agnes? No: if William died in 1088 and Agnes in 1097, that means Agnes died after William, so William did not die later; Agnes died later.

The question is: Did William die later than Agnes? So, if William died in 1088 and Agnes in 1097, then 1088 is before 1097, so William died earlier, not later. So the answer should be No.

But let me confirm the dates.

Upon second thought, I might have the wrong Agnes. Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy. Let me think about her life.

Agnes was the daughter of William VIII of Aquitaine and Hildegarde of Burgundy. She married Peter I of Savoy around 1080 or so. Peter I died in 1078? No, that can't be right.

Peter I of Savoy, also known as Peter the Elder, was Count of Savoy. I think he lived from around 1048 to 1078. If he died in 1078, and Agnes married him, when did she die?

Perhaps Agnes outlived him. Let me recall her death year.

I think Agnes of Aquitaine died in 1097. Yes, that's standard.

William de Warenne died in 1088.

So, 1088 vs. 1097. 1088 is earlier than 1097, so William died before Agnes, not later.

Therefore, the answer is No.

But to be thorough, let's make sure of the exact dates.

From historical records:

- William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey: Died 24 June 1088.

- Agnes of Aquitaine: Born c. 1059, died 1097.

Yes, confirmed.

So, death year of William: 1088

Death year of Agnes: 1097

Is 1088 later than 1097? No, 1088 < 1097, so William died earlier.

Thus, he did not die later than Agnes.

Answer should be No.

The question is clear: "die later than", meaning after.

So, step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the death years of both individuals.

2. William de Warenne died in 1088.

3. Agnes of Aquitaine died in 1097.

4. Compare the years: 1088 vs. 1097.

5. Since 1088 is before 1097, William died before Agnes.

6. Therefore, he did not die later than her.

Final answer: No.
