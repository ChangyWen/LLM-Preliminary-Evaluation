*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV located east of Pine Flat Dam, CA?" I need to answer with a simple Yes or No, but I must show my step-by-step reasoning.

Key elements:
- St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church is in NV (Nevada).
- Pine Flat Dam is in CA (California).
- I need to determine if the church is east of the dam.

To answer this, I need to know the geographical locations of both places.

Recall what I know:
- Nevada (NV) is a state in the western United States.
- California (CA) is also in the western United States, west of Nevada.
- Specifically, Pine Flat Dam is in California. I think it's in Fresno County, which is in central California.
- St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church: I'm not entirely sure, but the name suggests it might be in a mountainous area in Nevada. I recall there's a famous church by that name in Virginia City, Nevada.

Confirming that:
- Yes, St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church is located in Virginia City, Nevada. Virginia City is in western Nevada, known for its history during the Gold Rush.

Now, Pine Flat Dam:
- Pine Flat Dam is on the Kings River in Fresno County, California. Fresno is in the central part of California, in the San Joaquin Valley.

Next, I need to compare their east-west positions.

General geography:
- California is west of Nevada. The state border between California and Nevada runs roughly north-south.
- Virginia City, Nevada, is in the western part of Nevada, close to the California border. It's in the Sierra Nevada mountain range area.
- Fresno, California, where Pine Flat Dam is, is east of the California coast but still in California. Fresno is inland, in the Central Valley.

To be precise, I need to think about longitude.

Approximate longitudes:
- Virginia City, NV: It's around 119° W longitude. (I think Reno is nearby, and Reno is about 119.8° W.)
- Pine Flat Dam, CA: Fresno is around 119.7° W longitude. Pine Flat Dam is near Fresno, so similar longitude.

That might be close. Let me think carefully.

Actually, both might have similar longitudes because:
- The California-Nevada border is not straight, but in the area of Virginia City and Fresno, they could be close.
- Virginia City is near Lake Tahoe area, which is on the border.
- Lake Tahoe is shared by California and Nevada, and it's around 120° W.
- Virginia City is east of Lake Tahoe, so slightly east.
- Fresno is south of that, in the Central Valley.

Let's get better estimates:
- Longitude of Virginia City, NV: Approximately 119.65° W.
- Longitude of Fresno, CA: Approximately 119.78° W for the city center.
- Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. I think it's around 119.3° W or something. Wait, no.

Upon second thought:
- Fresno is at about 119.7° W.
- Pine Flat Dam is on the Kings River, which is east of Fresno, towards the mountains. So, it might have a slightly lower longitude number, meaning east, since longitude decreases as you go east in the western hemisphere.

Longitude: In the western hemisphere, longitude increases as you go west, and decreases as you go east. No:
- Longitude lines are measured from 0° at Greenwich, increasing east and west to 180°.
- In the US, we use West longitudes, so higher numbers are further west.

Standard: Longitude is measured with East and West.
- For example, New York is around 74° W, Los Angeles is around 118° W, so higher W longitude means further west.

So:
- Moving east, longitude decreases (e.g., from 120° W to 119° W is moving east).
- Moving west, longitude increases.

Now, positions:
- Virginia City, NV: Located at approximately 39.31° N, 119.65° W.
- Pine Flat Dam, CA: I need its coordinates. From memory, it's near 36.84° N, 119.33° W. Wait, is that right?

Let me recall:
- Fresno is at about 36.7° N, 119.8° W.
- Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno, so longitude should be less than 119.8° W, meaning east.

Actually, looking it up in my mind: Pine Flat Dam is at approximately 36.85° N, 119.32° W. (I'm estimating.)

Standard knowledge:
- The Sierra Nevada range runs north-south.
- Virginia City is on the east side of the Sierra Nevada, in Nevada.
- Pine Flat Dam is on the west side of the Sierra Nevada, in California.

The Sierra Nevada mountains act as a divider.
- West of the Sierra Nevada is California, east is Nevada.
- So, any point in Nevada is generally east of points in California at the same latitude, but not always, because the border zigzags.

Specifically:
- At the latitude of Virginia City (around 39° N), the California-Nevada border is such that Virginia City is east of most of California.
- But Pine Flat Dam is at a lower latitude, around 37° N (Fresno area is 36-37° N).

Latitudes are different:
- Virginia City, NV: about 39.3° N
- Pine Flat Dam, CA: about 36.8° N

They are not at the same latitude, so I need to be careful with "east of."

The question is about east-west direction, regardless of latitude. So, I need to compare their longitudes directly.

Longitude comparison:
- Virginia City, NV: longitude approximately 119.65° W
- Pine Flat Dam, CA: let's confirm. Pine Flat Dam is located at about 119.05° W or something? No.

Upon better recollection:
- Fresno, CA, is at 119.78° W.
- Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno, in the mountains, so longitude is less, e.g., around 119.3° W or 119.0° W? I think it's around 119.32° W for Pine Flat Dam.

Actually, standard coordinates:
- From memory or general knowledge, Pine Flat Dam is at approximately 36.8367° N, 119.3267° W.
- Virginia City, NV, is at approximately 39.3142° N, 119.6500° W.

Now, compare longitudes:
- Pine Flat Dam: 119.3267° W
- Virginia City: 119.6500° W

Since both are west longitudes, a smaller number means further east.
- 119.3267° W is east of 119.6500° W because 119.3267 is less than 119.6500 in the numerical value, but since it's W, smaller W longitude means closer to the prime meridian in the east direction.

Longitude: 119.3267° W vs 119.6500° W.
- 119.6500° W is further west than 119.3267° W.
- Therefore, 119.3267° W (Pine Flat Dam) is east of 119.6500° W (Virginia City)? No.

If longitude is 119.6500° W, that's more west than 119.3267° W.
- Numerical value: 119.6500 > 119.3267, so 119.6500° W is further west.
- Therefore, a point at 119.3267° W is east of a point at 119.6500° W.

Longitude increases as you go west.
- So, higher longitude value (more degrees W) means further west.
- Lower longitude value (fewer degrees W) means further east.

Example: 120° W is west of 119° W.
- So, 119° W is east of 120° W.

In this case:
- Pine Flat Dam at 119.3267° W
- Virginia City at 119.6500° W

119.3267° W vs 119.6500° W: 119.3267 is less than 119.6500, so Pine Flat Dam has a smaller longitude value, meaning it is east of Virginia City.

Smaller longitude in W means closer to 0°, which is east.

Confirm the values:
- If Pine Flat Dam is at 119.3267° W and Virginia City is at 119.6500° W, then yes, 119.3267° W is east of 119.6500° W because you have to go west to increase the longitude.

Numerically, 119.3267 < 119.6500, so Pine Flat Dam has a smaller W longitude, thus it is located east of Virginia City.

But that can't be right geographically.

I think I have the longitudes wrong.

Let me double-check typical longitudes.

I know that Reno, NV, is near Virginia City, and Reno is at about 119.81° W.
Virginia City is east of Reno? No, Virginia City is southeast of Reno, but still in the same area.

Actually, Reno is at approximately 119.8137° W, 39.5296° N.
Virginia City is at about 119.6500° W, 39.3142° N, so slightly east of Reno because 119.65 < 119.81, so yes, Virginia City is east of Reno.

Longitude 119.65° W vs 119.81° W: 119.65 is less, so east.

Now, Fresno, CA, is at about 119.787° W, 36.738° N.
Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno, in the Sierra Nevada.

Upon checking my memory, Pine Flat Dam is located at approximately 36.8367° N, 119.3267° W. Is that accurate?

I think Fresno is at 119.78° W, and the Sierra Nevada to the east would have longitudes decreasing, so east.

Fresno is in the valley, and the mountains are east, so longitudes for points east of Fresno should be smaller numbers.

For example, Yosemite National Park, which is east of Fresno, has longitudes around 119.5° W to 118.5° W or so.

Specifically, Pine Flat Dam: I believe it's at about 119.32° W.

Now, Virginia City at 119.65° W.

So, 119.32° W vs 119.65° W: 119.32 < 119.65, so Pine Flat Dam is at a smaller longitude value, meaning it is east of Virginia City.

But geographically, is that correct?

Latitudes are different: Pine Flat Dam is at 36.8° N, Virginia City at 39.3° N, so Pine Flat Dam is south, and if it's at 119.32° W and Virginia City at 119.65° W, then yes, Pine Flat Dam is both south and east of Virginia City.

Let's confirm the relative positions.

The Sierra Nevada runs northwest-southeast, so at lower latitudes, the mountains are further east or west?

Generally, California is west of Nevada, but at different latitudes, the border varies.

Specifically, at 39° N, the California-Nevada border is around 120° W for some parts, but Virginia City is in Nevada at 119.65° W, which is east of much of California.

Fresno is at 119.78° W, which is very close to Virginia City's 119.65° W, but Fresno is slightly west of Virginia City because 119.78 > 119.65, so Fresno is further west.

Longitude: higher number W means further west.

So, Virginia City: 119.65° W
Fresno: 119.78° W — since 119.78 > 119.65, Fresno is west of Virginia City.

Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno. If Fresno is at 119.78° W, and Pine Flat Dam is east, so longitude less than 119.78° W, say 119.32° W, then 119.32° W is east of 119.78° W.

Now compare to Virginia City at 119.65° W.

So, Pine Flat Dam at 119.32° W, Virginia City at 119.65° W.

119.32 < 119.65, so Pine Flat Dam is east of Virginia City.

Is Pine Flat Dam really at 119.32° W? Let me make sure.

Upon second thought, I might have the longitude wrong for Pine Flat Dam.

Let me think: the Sierra Nevada crest is around 119° W to 118° W in some areas.

For example, Lake Tahoe is at about 120° W for the west side, 119.9° W or so.

Lake Tahoe: western shore in CA at about 120.0° W, eastern shore in NV at about 119.9° W or less.

Virginia City is east of Lake Tahoe, so longitude less than 119.9° W, yes 119.65° W.

Fresno is at 119.78° W, which is very close.

Pine Flat Dam is on the Kings River, which is south of Fresno, and the dam is in the foothills.

Upon accurate recall, Pine Flat Dam is located at approximately 36.8367° N latitude and 119.3267° W longitude. Yes, that's standard.

Virginia City is at 39.3142° N, 119.6500° W.

So longitudes: Pine Flat Dam 119.3267° W, Virginia City 119.6500° W.

Difference: 119.3267 vs 119.6500. Since 119.3267 < 119.6500, and both W, Pine Flat Dam has a smaller westward longitude, meaning it is located further east.

In fact, the difference is about 0.3233 degrees longitude.

At that latitude, 1 degree longitude is approximately 111 km * cos(latitude), but roughly, it's east.

To confirm if St. Mary’s church is east of Pine Flat Dam.

St. Mary’s is in Virginia City, NV, at 119.65° W.

Pine Flat Dam at 119.3267° W.

Since 119.65° W is greater than 119.3267° W in numerical value, Virginia City is west of Pine Flat Dam.

Longitude: higher W value means further west.

So, Virginia City at 119.65° W is further west than Pine Flat Dam at 119.3267° W.

Therefore, Virginia City (and thus the church) is west of Pine Flat Dam.

The question is: is the church located east of Pine Flat Dam?

If church is at 119.65° W and dam is at 119.3267° W, then church is west of dam, not east.

Numerically: dam longitude 119.3267° W, church 119.6500° W.

119.6500 > 119.3267, so church has higher W longitude, thus further west, so it is west of the dam.

Therefore, it is not east of the dam.

But earlier I thought Pine Flat Dam is in California, church in Nevada, but due to the specific longitudes, Pine Flat Dam is actually east of Virginia City.

Is that possible? Let me visualize.

California is west of Nevada, but the border is such that in the north, near Lake Tahoe, Nevada extends west, but Virginia City is in Nevada, east of the Sierra crest.

Pine Flat Dam is on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada in California.

The Sierra Nevada ridge line: for example, at latitude 37° N, the crest might be around 119° W or so.

Actually, upon thinking, the Sierra Nevada crest runs from about 120° W in the north to 118° W in the south.

For instance, Donner Pass near 120° W, Yosemite at around 119.5° W for some parts.

Pine Flat Dam is not on the crest; it's on the western side.

Pine Flat Dam is on the Kings River, which flows west from the Sierra, so Pine Flat Dam is west of the crest.

Let's clarify.

The Kings River originates in the Sierra Nevada, flows west through Pine Flat Dam into the San Joaquin Valley.

So, Pine Flat Dam is located in the foothills, west of the highest parts of the Sierra.

Longitude: the Sierra crest near Fresno latitude (37° N) is around 118.5° W to 119° W.

For example, Mount Whitney is at 36.5786° N, 118.292° W, which is far south.

At 37° N, say near Kings Canyon, the crest might be around 118.7° W.

Pine Flat Dam is at 119.3267° W, which is west of the crest.

Virginia City is at 39.3° N, 119.65° W.

Now, at 39.3° N, the Sierra crest is around 120° W or so (e.g., near Truckee).

So, Virginia City at 119.65° W is east of the Sierra crest, while Pine Flat Dam at 119.32° W and 36.8° N is on the western side but at a different latitude.

To compare east-west, solely based on longitude, ignoring latitude, Pine Flat Dam at 119.32° W is east of Virginia City at 119.65° W.

But in terms of actual direction on a map, since they are at different latitudes, the straight-line direction might not be purely east or west, but the question likely means in terms of longitude or general direction.

Typically, "east of" refers to longitude when comparing points not at the same latitude.

So, based on longitude, Pine Flat Dam has longitude 119.32° W, church has 119.65° W, so church is at a higher longitude value (more west), so it is west of Pine Flat Dam.

Therefore, the church is not east of Pine Flat Dam; it is west of it.

But intuitively, Nevada is east of California, but in this specific case, because Pine Flat Dam is further south and in the mountains, its longitude is smaller.

To confirm with actual geography: Virginia City, NV, is near Reno, which is east of the California border. The California border at that latitude is around 120° W for some parts, but Virginia City is at 119.65° W, while Sacramento, CA, is at about 121.5° W, but that's west.

Better: the city of Susanville, CA, is at about 120.66° W, 40.42° N.

Perhaps compare to a point at same latitude.

At 39° N, the California coast is around 123° W, San Francisco is 122.4° W, so inland California at 39° N might be around 121° W or so for the valley, and the Sierra crest around 120° W.

Virginia City at 39.3° N, 119.65° W is east of the Sierra crest, so in Nevada.

Pine Flat Dam at 36.8° N, 119.32° W: at 37° N, the California coast is similar, Los Angeles is 118.2° W, but inland, Fresno is at 119.78° W, which is east of LA.

But comparing longitudes: 119.32° W for Pine Flat Dam vs 119.65° W for Virginia City.

Yes, 119.32 is less than 119.65, so Pine Flat Dam is approximately 0.33 degrees east of Virginia City in longitude.

Since 1 degree longitude at equator is 111 km, at latitude 37° N, cos(37°) ≈ 0.8, so about 89 km per degree, so 0.33 degrees is about 29 km difference in east-west direction.

So yes, Pine Flat Dam is slightly east of Virginia City in terms of longitude.

Therefore, Virginia City (and the church) is west of Pine Flat Dam.

So, is the church located east of Pine Flat Dam? No.

Final answer should be No.

But let's make sure the locations are correct.

St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church is indeed in Virginia City, Nevada.

Pine Flat Dam is in California, near Fresno.

Yes.

So, based on this, the church is not east of the dam; it's west.

The question says "east of", and based on longitude, it's west.

Perhaps the question implies a general sense, but strictly speaking, from the coordinates, it's west.

Maybe I have the longitude of Pine Flat Dam wrong.

Let me double-check my memory.

Upon thinking, Fresno is at 119.78° W, and Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno, so longitude should be smaller, yes.

For example, online or standard knowledge, Pine Flat Dam longitude is approximately 119.33° W.

Virginia City is 119.65° W.

Yes.

So, church longitude 119.65° W, dam 119.33° W, so church is at higher longitude value, thus west.

Therefore, not east.

So, answer is No.
*********************************** End of Thinking ************************************




**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church in Nevada is located east of Pine Flat Dam in California, I will reason step by step based on geographical knowledge and coordinate comparisons.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations:**
   - St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church is located in Virginia City, Nevada. Its approximate coordinates are 39.3142° N, 119.6500° W.
   - Pine Flat Dam is located on the Kings River in Fresno County, California. Its approximate coordinates are 36.8367° N, 119.3267° W.

2. **Understand the concept of "east" and "west":**
   - East-west positioning is primarily determined by longitude. In the Western Hemisphere, longitude is measured in degrees West (W). A lower longitude value (e.g., 119.3267° W) indicates a position further east compared to a higher longitude value (e.g., 119.6500° W), because longitude increases as you move west.

3. **Compare the longitudes:**
   - Longitude of St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church (Virginia City, NV): 119.6500° W.
   - Longitude of Pine Flat Dam (CA): 119.3267° W.
   - Since 119.6500° W is greater than 119.3267° W, the church is located further west than the dam. This means the church is west of Pine Flat Dam, not east.

4. **Consider other factors:**
   - The latitudes are different (39.3142° N for the church and 36.8367° N for the dam), but the question is about east-west direction, which is based on longitude rather than latitude.
   - Geographically, Nevada is generally east of California, but specific locations can vary due to the irregular state border and the Sierra Nevada mountain range. In this case, the longitude comparison confirms the relative positions.

5. **Conclusion based on the comparison:**
   - The church is not located east of Pine Flat Dam; it is west of it.

### Final Answer:
No
