*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan located south of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan?" I need to answer with a simple Yes or No, but show my step-by-step reasoning.

I know that Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The question says "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which might be a mistake. Similarly, HILLMAN HOUSES – I'm not sure what that is, but it could be in Manhattan.

Let me recall: Williamsburg is definitely in Brooklyn, New York. It's across the East River from Manhattan. HILLMAN HOUSES – I think that might refer to the Hillman Housing Project, which I believe is in Manhattan. Upon thinking, I recall that there are housing projects in Manhattan, but I'm not entirely sure about the name. Perhaps it's a specific location.

Assuming the question has a typo or error, because Williamsburg is not in Manhattan. Maybe it's meant to be Williamsburg in Brooklyn, and HILLMAN HOUSES in Manhattan. That makes more sense for a directional question.

Perhaps WILLIAMSBURG refers to something else, but I doubt it. Let me confirm: Williamsburg is a well-known neighborhood in Brooklyn.

Now, HILLMAN HOUSES: After a quick mental search, I think Hillman Housing is in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Yes, I believe it's a public housing development there.

So, if Williamsburg is in Brooklyn and HILLMAN HOUSES is in Manhattan, then I need to determine if Williamsburg is south of HILLMAN HOUSES.

Manhattan is an island, and Brooklyn is to the south and east of Manhattan. Specifically, Williamsburg in Brooklyn is north of most of Brooklyn but still south of parts of Manhattan.

Let's think about geography:

- Manhattan is oriented north-south, with Lower Manhattan at the south end and Upper Manhattan at the north.

- HILLMAN HOUSES, if in the Lower East Side, is in southern Manhattan.

- Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is across the East River, directly east of Lower Manhattan. But in terms of north-south direction:

Brooklyn is generally south of Manhattan. Manhattan's southern tip is at the Battery, and Brooklyn extends south from there.

Williamsburg is in northern Brooklyn, near the Williamsburg Bridge, which connects to Delancey Street in Lower Manhattan.

So, if HILLMAN HOUSES is in the Lower East Side, which is around the same latitude as Delancey Street, and Williamsburg is just across the river, it might be at a similar latitude or slightly south.

Actually, let's think about coordinates:

- Lower East Side of Manhattan is around 40.7128° N latitude.

- Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is also around the same latitude because it's directly across the river. The Williamsburg Bridge connects them, so they are at similar north-south positions.

But is Williamsburg exactly at the same latitude or slightly different?

Upon recalling, the East River runs roughly north-south, but with some bends. Williamsburg is slightly north of the southern part of Manhattan.

Manhattan's grid: Lower Manhattan has streets like Canal Street, Delancey Street, etc.

Williamsburg Bridge lands at Delancey Street, which is in the Lower East Side.

HILLMAN HOUSES – I need to confirm its location. Assuming it's in the Lower East Side, perhaps near or around there.

If both are near Delancey Street area, one in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn across the river, then in terms of strict north-south direction, since the river is narrow, they are very close in latitude.

But typically, when we say "south of," we consider the directional orientation.

Brooklyn is south and east of Manhattan island. Specifically, Williamsburg is east of Lower Manhattan.

But is it south or north?

Let's think: If you stand in Lower East Side Manhattan, Williamsburg is directly east across the river, but since the river flows south to north (actually, East River flows from Long Island Sound to Upper New York Bay, so generally south), but the orientation is such that Williamsburg is at a similar latitude.

Perhaps I should consider approximate latitudes.

From memory:

- Downtown Manhattan (Lower East Side) is around 40.71° N.

- Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is also around 40.71° N, since it's adjacent.

In fact, looking it up in my mind, Delancey Street in Manhattan is about 40.717° N, and Williamsburg in Brooklyn is similar.

But to be precise, Williamsburg extends a bit north and south, but the main area near the bridge is comparable.

However, the question is about north-south direction. If they are at the same latitude, then neither is strictly south of the other.

But the question asks if Williamsburg is south of HILLMAN HOUSES.

If they are at the same latitude, the answer should be no, it's not south.

But perhaps HILLMAN HOUSES is located specifically.

Let me try to recall: Hillman Housing is a NYCHA development in Manhattan's Lower East Side, probably around East Houston or Delancey.

Assuming it's around there.

Now, Williamsburg: the neighborhood starts just across the East River.

Actually, upon thinking, the southern part of Williamsburg might be slightly south of some parts, but generally, it's aligned.

Perhaps I can think of it this way: Manhattan's Lower East Side and Williamsburg are separated by the East River, but Williamsburg is not south of Manhattan; it's east.

In terms of cardinal directions, to go from HILLMAN HOUSES in Lower East Side Manhattan to Williamsburg, you go east, not south or north.

So, Williamsburg is not located south of HILLMAN HOUSES; it's located east.

Therefore, the answer should be no.

But the question specifies "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which is incorrect. Perhaps the user meant Williamsburg in Brooklyn.

Maybe there's a Williamsburg in Manhattan, but I don't think so. Williamsburg is distinctly Brooklyn.

Perhaps it's a trick question, and since Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan, the premise is false.

But that might be overcomplicating. Probably, it's a mistake, and I should assume it's Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Even so, as I thought, it's not south.

Let's confirm the location of HILLMAN HOUSES.

Upon double-checking my knowledge, Hillman Houses is a public housing project in Manhattan, located on the Lower East Side, bounded by East Houston Street, Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, and the East River. So, it's very close to the river.

Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is directly across the East River from there.

In terms of latitude, let's say HILLMAN HOUSES is at approximately 40.72° N, and Williamsburg is also around 40.71-40.72° N.

For example, the Williamsburg Bridge is at about 40.713° N on both sides.

So, they are at virtually the same latitude.

Therefore, Williamsburg is not south of HILLMAN HOUSES; it's at the same latitude, but to the east.

Hence, it is not located south of it.

So, the answer should be No.

If there's any part of Williamsburg that is south, but the neighborhood as a whole isn't defined as south.

Moreover, the question says "located south of," which implies a directional position.

Since it's east, not south, the answer is no.

Finally, the initial part: "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" – since Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan, perhaps the answer is invalid, but I think for practical purposes, we can assume it's a reference error.

To be strict, if it's specified as Manhattan, and Williamsburg isn't there, then it's not located anywhere in Manhattan, so the question might not make sense.

But that seems pedantic. Probably, the intent is to compare the two locations.

I'll go with No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
The query specifies "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," but Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. This appears to be an error in the query. Assuming the intent is to compare Williamsburg in Brooklyn to HILLMAN HOUSES in Manhattan, I'll proceed with that interpretation. HILLMAN HOUSES is a public housing development located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify locations**: 
   - Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, across the East River from Manhattan. It is a neighborhood in northern Brooklyn, with its main area near the Williamsburg Bridge.
   - HILLMAN HOUSES is in Manhattan's Lower East Side, near East Houston Street and the East River.

2. **Determine relative positions**:
   - Manhattan and Brooklyn are adjacent boroughs, separated by the East River.
   - The Lower East Side of Manhattan (where HILLMAN HOUSES is located) and Williamsburg in Brooklyn are at approximately the same latitude (around 40.71–40.72° N), as they are directly across from each other via the East River.
   - Williamsburg is primarily east of the Lower East Side, not south or north, due to the orientation of the East River and the bridge connecting them.

3. **Evaluate north-south direction**:
   - Since Williamsburg and HILLMAN HOUSES are at similar latitudes, Williamsburg is not located south of HILLMAN HOUSES. Instead, it is situated to the east.
   - Brooklyn as a whole is generally south and east of Manhattan, but Williamsburg specifically is not south of the Lower East Side; it is aligned roughly parallel in a north-south sense.

4. **Consider the query's specificity**:
   - The query incorrectly states "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan," which may invalidate the premise. However, based on standard geographical knowledge and assuming a comparison between Williamsburg (Brooklyn) and HILLMAN HOUSES (Manhattan), the directional analysis holds.

Final answer: No. Williamsburg is not located south of HILLMAN HOUSES; it is approximately at the same latitude but to the east.
