*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is The Ort Institute, IL located west of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to understand the locations. The Ort Institute is in IL, which I assume means Illinois. The University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in WI, which is Wisconsin. So, we're comparing a location in Illinois to one in Wisconsin.

Now, the key is to determine if the Ort Institute in Illinois is west of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan in Wisconsin. To do this, I need to know their approximate positions.

Recall the geography of the US. Wisconsin is in the Midwest, bordering Lake Michigan on the east. Illinois is also in the Midwest, south of Wisconsin, and Chicago is in northeastern Illinois.

University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan: Sheboygan is a city in Wisconsin, on the eastern side, along Lake Michigan. So, it's in eastern Wisconsin.

The Ort Institute: I'm not familiar with this. The question says "The Ort Institute, IL", so it's in Illinois. But I need to know where exactly in Illinois. The abbreviation might imply a city or something, but it's just "IL", so perhaps it's a general location in Illinois. That could be a problem because Illinois is a large state.

Re-reading the question: "The Ort Institute, IL" – probably means it's located in Illinois, but it doesn't specify the city. Similarly, "University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI" specifies Sheboygan.

I should assume that "The Ort Institute, IL" is in a specific part of Illinois. Maybe it's a real place, or perhaps it's hypothetical. Since this is a reasoning exercise, I might need to make an educated guess or use general knowledge.

Perhaps "Ort" is a typo or something. I recall that there's an ORT Institute, but I'm not sure. Upon thinking, ORT might refer to the Organization for Rehabilitation through Training, which has institutions, but I'm not sure about one in Illinois.

Maybe it's the "Art Institute" or something, but it says "Ort". Perhaps it's a placeholder. For the sake of this exercise, I should assume it's in Illinois and find a typical location.

To answer whether it's west, I need relative positions.

Let me think about the states:

- Wisconsin: Sheboygan is in eastern Wisconsin, near Lake Michigan.

- Illinois: If the Ort Institute is in Illinois, it could be anywhere, but perhaps it's in a major city like Chicago, which is in northeastern Illinois.

Chicago is very close to Wisconsin. In fact, Chicago is south of Milwaukee, which is in southeastern Wisconsin.

Let's think about directions:

- Sheboygan, WI is approximately at 43.75° N, 87.71° W (I can recall roughly).

- Chicago, IL is at about 41.88° N, 87.62° W.

Both have similar longitude, around 87.7° W, but Chicago is south of Sheboygan.

Longitude is similar, so east-west position might be close.

Sheboygan longitude is about 87.7° W, Chicago is 87.6° W, so Chicago is slightly east of Sheboygan? No:

Longitude: higher west means further west? No, longitude lines: 87° W is the same meridian, but let's check.

Actually, standard longitude: moving west increases the degree west.

Sheboygan, WI: looking it up in my mind, Sheboygan is at approximately 87.714° W.

Chicago, IL: 87.629° W.

87.714° W is west of 87.629° W because higher number west means further west.

Longitude is measured from Greenwich, so 87.714° W is further west than 87.629° W.

Let's clarify:

- Smaller longitude west value means closer to Greenwich, so east.

No: 0° is Greenwich, increasing west to 180° W.

So, 87.629° W is less west than 87.714° W? No:

87.629° W and 87.714° W: 87.714 is greater than 87.629, so 87.714° W is further west because it's a larger angle west.

For example, 90° W is west of 80° W.

87.714° W vs 87.629° W: 87.714 > 87.629, so 87.714° W is further west.

Difference: 87.714 - 87.629 = 0.085°, which is about 0.085 * 69 miles (since 1 degree longitude is approx 69 miles at equator, but less at higher latitudes).

At latitude 43°, cosine of latitude affects it, but roughly, Chicago at 87.629° W, Sheboygan at 87.714° W, so Sheboygan is slightly west of Chicago.

87.714 > 87.629, so yes, Sheboygan has a higher longitude west value, so it's further west.

But Chicago is in Illinois, and Sheboygan is in Wisconsin, but geographically, Wisconsin extends further west.

Sheboygan is on the east side of Wisconsin, Chicago is on the west side of Lake Michigan.

Lake Michigan: Chicago is on the southwest shore, Sheboygan is on the east shore of Wisconsin.

From memory: Milwaukee is at about 87.9° W, Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee, similar longitude.

Actually, looking up approximate longitudes:

- Chicago, IL: approximately 87.65° W

- Sheboygan, WI: approximately 87.71° W

Yes, so 87.71 > 87.65, so Sheboygan is at 87.71° W, Chicago at 87.65° W, so Sheboygan is slightly west of Chicago.

Difference is small: 0.06°, which is about 4 miles (since 1 degree longitude at 43° N is cos(43°) * 69 miles ≈ 0.731 * 69 ≈ 50.5 miles per degree, so 0.06° * 50.5 ≈ 3 miles). So very close, but Sheboygan is slightly west.

But the question is about The Ort Institute in IL. If it's in Chicago, then University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is slightly west of Chicago, so if Ort Institute is in Chicago, then it's east of Sheboygan, not west.

The question is: is Ort Institute west of UW-Sheboygan?

If Ort is in Chicago (87.65° W) and UW-Sheboygan is at 87.71° W, then 87.65° W is less west, so it's east of 87.71° W.

Longitude: smaller number west means east.

87.65° W is east of 87.71° W because 87.65 is smaller than 87.71 in the west direction.

Think of it as the numerical value: higher numerical longitude west means further west.

So, location with longitude L1 is west of L2 if L1 > L2 (both west longitudes).

Standard: if L1 > L2 for west longitudes, then L1 is west of L2.

Example: 90° W is west of 80° W.

Yes.

So, UW-Sheboygan at approx 87.71° W.

Chicago at 87.65° W.

87.65 < 87.71, so Chicago is east of Sheboygan.

Difference is small, but yes.

But is The Ort Institute in Chicago? The question just says "IL", not specifying the city.

Illinois spans from about 87° W to 91° W or so.

Western Illinois is further west.

For example, Rockford, IL is at about 89° W, which is west of Chicago.

89° W is greater than 87.71° W, so Rockford is west of Sheboygan.

Let's check longitudes.

Sheboygan, WI: approx 87.71° W.

Eastern Illinois, like Chicago: 87.65° W (east of Sheboygan).

Western Illinois, like Quincy, IL: around 91.4° W.

91.4° W is much further west than 87.71° W.

So, depending on where in Illinois the Ort Institute is, it could be east or west of Sheboygan.

This is a problem. The question doesn't specify the location within Illinois.

Perhaps I need to assume a typical location or look for the actual Ort Institute.

Maybe "The Ort Institute, IL" is a specific place. Let me think if I know it.

Upon searching my knowledge, I'm not aware of "The Ort Institute" in Illinois. Perhaps it's a typo or fictional.

Maybe it's "The Art Institute of Chicago" or something, but it says "Ort".

Another thought: ORT might refer to a educational institution. I recall ORT is an international network, and there might be one in Chicago or Illinois.

Upon quick think, I believe there is an ORT Technical Institute or something in Chicago.

Assuming that's the case, it's likely in the Chicago area.

Perhaps for this exercise, I should assume it's in northeastern Illinois, like Chicago.

But to be precise, let's consider the states.

Wisconsin's eastern border is with Lake Michigan, and Illinois is south of Wisconsin, but their longitudes overlap.

Wisconsin longitude range: from about 86.9° W (east) to 92.9° W (west).

Sheboygan is on the east side, so around 87.7° W.

Illinois longitude range: from 87.5° W (east, Chicago) to 91.5° W (west).

So, parts of Illinois are east of Sheboygan, parts are west.

For example, Chicago is east, while western IL is west.

But University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is specifically in Sheboygan, which is east.

Now, if the Ort Institute is in Illinois, without specification, it's ambiguous.

But perhaps in such questions, we assume the most prominent location or the state capital or something.

Illinois capital is Springfield, at about 89.65° W longitude.

Sheboygan at 87.71° W.

89.65 > 87.71, so Springfield, IL is west of Sheboygan, WI.

Because 89.65° W is further west than 87.71° W.

Difference is about 1.94°, which is significant.

At latitude 40-43°, 1 degree longitude is about 50 miles, so about 97 miles west.

So, if Ort Institute is in Springfield or western IL, yes, west.

If in Chicago, no, east.

So, I need to know where it is.

Perhaps "The Ort Institute" is not real, or perhaps it's in a specific place.

Another thought: maybe "Ort" is a misspelling of "Art", but Art Institute of Chicago is in Chicago.

Perhaps it's the "Illinois Institute of Technology" or something, but not Ort.

Upon second thought, I think there might be an ORT America or something, but I'm not sure about a specific institute in IL.

Perhaps for the purpose of this question, I should use general knowledge or assume.

But to reason step by step, I can say that since Sheboygan is in eastern Wisconsin, and Illinois is largely south but with varying longitude, but on average, the center of Illinois might be west.

But that's not accurate.

Perhaps the question expects me to know that most of Illinois is west of eastern Wisconsin.

Sheboygan is at the eastern edge.

The westernmost point of Wisconsin is at 92.89° W, easternmost at 86.95° W or so.

Sheboygan is at 87.71° W, which is close to the east.

Illinois easternmost is 87.52° W (Chicago area), westernmost 91.51° W.

So, the line of longitude 87.71° W: in Illinois, that's very close to Chicago, perhaps in the suburbs.

87.71° W is slightly west of Chicago's 87.65° W, so in Illinois, at that longitude, it's still in northeastern Illinois, near the border.

But Sheboygan is at 43.75° N, Chicago at 41.88° N, so south as well.

For east-west, longitude matters.

Any point in Illinois with longitude > 87.71° W is west of Sheboygan.

Chicago is at 87.65° W < 87.71° W, so east.

But most of Illinois has longitude greater than 87.71° W, since Illinois extends to 91.5° W.

For example, the majority of Illinois is west of 87.71° W.

Let's think about the area.

Chicago area is small compared to the whole state.

The longitude 87.71° W cuts through northeastern Illinois.

West of that is most of the state.

But for a specific institute, I need to know.

Perhaps "The Ort Institute, IL" is intended to be in a standard location.

Maybe it's a trick, and I need to say no because Illinois is south, but the question is about west, which is longitudinal.

The question is specifically "west", so direction, not just state.

Perhaps I can assume it's in Chicago, as it's the largest city.

In that case, Chicago is east of Sheboygan.

From earlier calculation, Chicago longitude 87.65° W, Sheboygan 87.71° W, so Chicago is at smaller longitude west, so east of Sheboygan.

Yes.

And since they are close in latitude or not, but for pure east-west, longitude determines it.

Latitude difference: Sheboygan 43.75° N, Chicago 41.88° N, so Chicago is south, but for west, it's the longitude.

So, if Ort Institute is in Chicago, it is east of UW-Sheboygan, so not west.

Answer would be No.

But is it in Chicago? I'm not sure.

Perhaps I can look for the actual location.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, and I don't have real-time data, I should assume it's in a typical Illinois location.

But to be safe, perhaps the question implies a specific place, but since it's not specified, maybe I need to say it's possible or something, but the question asks for Yes or No, so probably assumes a specific location.

Another thought: "The Ort Institute" might be a made-up name, and I need to use the state abbreviation.

Perhaps in the context, IL means Illinois, and I need to compare the states.

But states have area, so it's not precise.

Perhaps for simplicity, compare the approximate centers.

Center of Wisconsin is around 44.5° N, 89.5° W or so.

Center of Illinois is around 40° N, 89° W.

UW-Sheboygan is at 87.71° W, center of Illinois at 89° W, so 89 > 87.71, so center of Illinois is west of Sheboygan.

But again, not the institute.

I think the best bet is to assume the Ort Institute is in Chicago, as it's the most famous city in Illinois.

In that case, it is east of Sheboygan, so not west.

So answer No.

Perhaps the name "Ort" suggests something. Ort means place in German, but not helpful.

I think I'll go with No, assuming it's in eastern Illinois.

To be thorough, let's say if it's in Chicago, no.

If in western IL, yes.

But since the question likely expects a definite answer, and Chicago is the primary city, I'll say No.

Perhaps I can think of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan as in eastern WI, and Illinois as generally south, but longitudinally, Chicago is very close.

But from calculation, Chicago is east.

Let's confirm with actual data.

Upon recalling, Milwaukee is at 87.89° W, Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee, at similar longitude, say 87.7° W.

Chicago is at 87.6° W, so yes, Chicago is slightly east.

For example, driving from Chicago to Sheboygan, you go north, but slightly west, I think.

From Chicago to Milwaukee is north-northeast, I think, but longitude wise, Milwaukee is at 87.89° W, Chicago 87.62° W (more accurately), so 87.89 > 87.62, so Milwaukee is west of Chicago.

Chicago longitude: approximately 87.623° W.

Milwaukee: 87.907° W.

Sheboygan: 87.714° W? Wait, I think I have it wrong.

Let me correct.

Upon standard knowledge:

- Chicago, IL: longitude approximately 87.629° W (negative in some systems, but in degrees west).

- Milwaukee, WI: approximately 87.905° W.

- Sheboygan, WI: Sheboygan is east of Milwaukee? No, Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee on the lake.

Milwaukee is at about 43.038° N, 87.906° W.

Sheboygan is at 43.750° N, 87.714° W.

87.714° W for Sheboygan, 87.906° W for Milwaukee? 87.714 is less than 87.906? 87.714 < 87.906, so Sheboygan at 87.714° W, Milwaukee at 87.906° W, so Sheboygan has smaller longitude west value, so it's east of Milwaukee.

That can't be right because Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee on the same lake shore, so should be similar longitude or slightly east or west.

Upon correct recollection: Milwaukee is at approximately 87.91° W, Sheboygan is at 87.71° W? Let's think.

Actually, I think I have the numbers wrong.

Standard longitudes:

- Chicago: 87.6294° W

- Milwaukee: 87.9072° W (more west)

- Sheboygan: 87.7145° W? No, Sheboygan is east of Milwaukee? No, Wisconsin coast: Milwaukee is south, Sheboygan north, but the lake is straight, so longitudes should be similar.

Upon correct data: Milwaukee is at approx 87.89° W, but let's say:

Actual: Milwaukee latitude 43.0389° N, longitude -87.9065° (which is 87.9065° W)

Sheboygan: latitude 43.7506° N, longitude -87.7143° (87.7143° W)

87.7143 < 87.9065, so 87.7143° W is less west than 87.9065° W? No, 87.7143 is smaller number, so it's closer to Greenwich, so east.

87.7143° W vs 87.9065° W: 87.9065 > 87.7143, so Milwaukee at 87.9065° W is further west than Sheboygan at 87.7143° W.

But geographically, Sheboygan is north of Milwaukee on the Lake Michigan shore. Lake Michigan is oriented such that from south to north, longitude might change.

Actually, Lake Michigan coast in Wisconsin: Milwaukee is at the south, Sheboygan is north, and the lake bends, but 87.7143° W for Sheboygan and 87.9065° W for Milwaukee? That means Milwaukee is at higher longitude west, so further west, but that doesn't make sense because Sheboygan is east of Milwaukee? No, in Wisconsin, from south to north, Milwaukee is at the same latitude as Chicago area, but Sheboygan is north, and Lake Michigan is roughly parallel, but slightly, Milwaukee is at about 43°N, Sheboygan at 43.75°N, and longitude: upon check, I think I have it backward.

I think I have the longitude wrong.

Upon correct recollection, Milwaukee longitude is approximately 87.91° W, but let's think of Green Bay or something.

Standard: Chicago is at 87.63° W, Milwaukee is at 87.89° W, which is west of Chicago, and Sheboygan is at 87.71° W? No.

Look up mental map: from Chicago to Milwaukee, you go north-northwest, so both latitude and longitude change.

Chicago: 41.88°N, 87.63° W

Milwaukee: 43.04°N, 87.91° W

Sheboygan: 43.75°N, 87.71° W

87.71° W for Sheboygan and 87.91° W for Milwaukee: 87.71 < 87.91, so Sheboygan at 87.71° W is east of Milwaukee at 87.91° W.

Yes, that's correct; Sheboygan is slightly east of Milwaukee on the map.

Yes, because the lake shore curves.

So, Sheboygan is at approx 87.71° W, Chicago at 87.63° W, so 87.63 < 87.71, so Chicago is east of Sheboygan? 87.63 < 87.71, so Chicago at 87.63° W is less west, so east of 87.71° W.

Numerically, 87.63 < 87.71, so longitude 87.63° W is east of 87.71° W.

Yes, so Chicago is at 87.63° W, Sheboygan at 87.71° W, so Sheboygan is west of Chicago.

Difference 0.08°, about 5 miles at that latitude, so Sheboygan is slightly west of Chicago.

So, if Ort Institute is in Chicago, it is east of UW-Sheboygan, so not west.

Answer No.

And since most likely it's in Chicago or eastern IL, I'll go with No.

If it's in western IL, it could be yes, but I think for this context, No.

So, final answer No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if The Ort Institute in Illinois (IL) is located west of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan in Wisconsin (WI), I will reason step by step based on geographical knowledge of the locations involved.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations:**
   - The University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Sheboygan is situated on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, with approximate coordinates of 43.75° N latitude and 87.71° W longitude.
   - The Ort Institute is specified as being in Illinois (IL), but the exact city or location is not provided. Illinois is a large state, so the position could vary. For this analysis, I will consider the most likely or prominent location, as the query does not specify. Based on common knowledge, institutions in Illinois are often associated with major cities like Chicago (northeastern Illinois) or potentially other areas. I will assume The Ort Institute is in or near Chicago, as it is the largest city and a common reference point, unless otherwise indicated. Chicago has approximate coordinates of 41.88° N latitude and 87.63° W longitude.

2. **Understand the directional comparison:**
   - The question asks if The Ort Institute is *west* of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan. "West" is determined by longitude (east-west position), not latitude (north-south position). Longitude is measured in degrees west from the Prime Meridian (0°), so a higher longitude value (e.g., 88° W vs. 87° W) indicates a position further west.

3. **Compare longitudes:**
   - University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan: Approximately 87.71° W.
   - The Ort Institute (assumed in Chicago): Approximately 87.63° W.
   - Longitude comparison: 87.63° W (Chicago) is less than 87.71° W (Sheboygan). A lower longitude value means a position closer to the Prime Meridian, which corresponds to being further east. Therefore, Chicago (and thus The Ort Institute, if located there) is east of Sheboygan.

4. **Consider the ambiguity of Illinois' location:**
   - Illinois spans a range of longitudes from about 87.52° W (eastern edge, near Chicago) to 91.51° W (western edge). If The Ort Institute were in western Illinois (e.g., near Quincy at approximately 91.4° W), it would be west of Sheboygan (87.71° W). However, without specific location details, the assumption of a prominent or typical location like Chicago is reasonable, as it is the most populous area and often the default reference for Illinois-based institutions.
   - If the institute is in Chicago or eastern Illinois, it is east of Sheboygan. If it were in western Illinois, it could be west, but this is less likely without additional context.

5. **Calculate the directional difference:**
   - Longitude difference: 87.71° W (Sheboygan) minus 87.63° W (Chicago) = 0.08°. At this latitude (around 43° N), 1 degree of longitude is approximately 50 miles, so 0.08° is about 4 miles. This small difference confirms that Sheboygan is slightly west of Chicago, meaning Chicago (and The Ort Institute) is east of Sheboygan.

6. **Conclusion based on assumption:**
   - Assuming The Ort Institute is in or near Chicago (eastern Illinois), it is not west of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan; it is east. If the institute were in a different part of Illinois, the answer could change, but based on the most probable location, the answer is no.

### Final Answer: No
