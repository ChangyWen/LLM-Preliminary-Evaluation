*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Yamhill County, OR located north of Clackamas County, OR?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to recall or know the locations of these counties in Oregon. I'm familiar with Oregon's geography, but I should think this through logically.

Oregon is divided into counties, and I know some major ones. Clackamas County is in the northwest part of Oregon, adjacent to Portland. Portland is in Multnomah County, and Clackamas is south and east of that.

Yamhill County – I think it's also in the northwest, but I'm not sure exactly where. I believe Yamhill is west of Portland, in the Willamette Valley.

To determine if Yamhill is north of Clackamas, I need to compare their positions.

Let me sketch a mental map:

- Portland is in Multnomah County.

- Clackamas County is southeast of Portland, including areas like Oregon City.

- Yamhill County is southwest of Portland, including places like McMinnville.

If Clackamas is southeast and Yamhill is southwest, then Yamhill should be west of Clackamas, not necessarily north or south.

North-south direction: If Yamhill is southwest and Clackamas is southeast, they might be at similar latitudes or one could be north/south of the other.

I think both are in the Willamette Valley region, but let's think about their boundaries.

I recall that counties in Oregon are arranged in a grid-like fashion.

- Multnomah County (Portland) is central-north.

- To the south is Clackamas County.

- To the west is Washington County, and further south-west is Yamhill County.

Yamhill County is bordered by Washington County to the north and east, and Polk County to the south, I think.

Clackamas County is bordered by Multnomah to the north, and extends south and east.

To find if Yamhill is north of Clackamas, I need to see the latitude.

Generally, Yamhill County is west of Clackamas, but is it north or south?

I think Yamhill County is slightly south of parts of Clackamas.

Portland is at about 45.5° N latitude.

Clackamas County extends south from there, so its northern part is around 45.5°, and it goes down to maybe 45° N or less.

Yamhill County: McMinnville is in Yamhill, and I think it's around the same latitude or slightly south.

I believe both counties span similar latitudes, but let's think about their centers or main cities.

Oregon City (in Clackamas) is south of Portland, and McMinnville (in Yamhill) is also south-west.

Comparing directly: Is McMinnville north of Oregon City?

Oregon City is at approximately 45.34° N, and McMinnville is at about 45.21° N. I'm not sure about exact coordinates, but I think McMinnville is a bit south.

I can think about the order of counties.

From north to south in western Oregon: Starting from the Columbia River, Multnomah, then south to Clackamas, but Clackamas is east, while west is Washington County.

Washington County is north-west of Clackamas.

Yamhill is south of Washington County.

So, Washington County is north of Yamhill, and Clackamas is east of Washington.

Clackamas and Yamhill don't share a border directly, I think. There's probably Marion or other counties in between, but no.

Actually, Yamhill County borders Clackamas County? Let me think.

I believe Yamhill County is bordered by Washington to the north, Polk to the south, and Marion to the east. Marion is east of Yamhill.

Clackamas is south-east of Portland, while Yamhill is west.

To clarify: the western boundary.

Perhaps I can think of the Willamette River.

Clackamas County is on the east side of the Willamette, while Yamhill is on the west side.

Both are south of Portland, but Clackamas extends further east and south.

In terms of north-south, let's consider the latitude of their county seats.

County seat of Clackamas is Oregon City, latitude about 45.34° N.

County seat of Yamhill is McMinnville, latitude about 45.21° N.

I think McMinnville is slightly south of Oregon City.

Yes, upon recalling, Oregon City is at 45.34° N, and McMinnville is at 45.21° N, so McMinnville is south of Oregon City.

Therefore, Yamhill County, with its seat at McMinnville, is generally south of Clackamas County, which has its seat at Oregon City.

But counties have area, so parts might overlap in latitude.

However, the northern part of Yamhill County might be at similar latitude to southern Clackamas.

But overall, Yamhill is not north of Clackamas; it's more west and slightly south.

To be precise, is any part of Yamhill north of Clackamas? Probably not, since Clackamas extends north to the Columbia River in some parts, but Clackamas County's northern boundary is with Multnomah, so it goes up to about 45.5° N in some areas.

Multnomah County is north, Clackamas is south of that.

Yamhill's northern boundary is with Washington County, which is west of Multnomah.

Washington County's southern part might be around the same latitude.

But specifically, the northernmost point of Yamhill County is probably around 45.3° N or so, while Clackamas extends from about 45.5° N to 44.8° N or something.

Clackamas County includes areas north of 45.3° N? No, Multnomah is north, so Clackamas starts south of the Columbia River? No, the Columbia River is the northern boundary of Multnomah and other counties.

Multnomah County is bounded by the Columbia River to the north, and Clackamas is south of Multnomah.

So Clackamas's northern boundary is with Multnomah, so latitude starts from about 45.4° N or so.

Yamhill County's northern boundary is with Washington County. Washington County extends from the Columbia River south.

Washington County's northern part is at the Columbia, latitude 45.5°-46° N, and it goes south to about 45.2° N or so.

Then Yamhill is south of that, so Yamhill's northern latitude is around 45.3° N or less.

Upon better recollection, Yamhill County is entirely south of Clackamas County in terms of latitude.

For example, the city of Newberg in Yamhill County is at about 45.30° N, and Oregon City is at 45.34° N, so very close, but Oregon City is slightly north.

Newberg is in Yamhill County? Yes, northern Yamhill.

Oregon City is in Clackamas, at 45.34° N.

Newberg, Yamhill, is at approximately 45.30° N, so slightly south.

Moreover, the eastern part of Clackamas goes further south, but its northern part is north of Yamhill's northern part.

Since Yamhill is west, and the counties are adjacent via other counties, but directly, Yamhill does not extend as far north as Clackamas.

In fact, the highest latitude in Yamhill is less than that in Clackamas.

Clackamas County includes areas near Portland's southern suburbs, while Yamhill is further west and south.

To answer if Yamhill is located north of Clackamas: no, because Clackamas extends further north.

For one location to be north of another, typically we mean that it is entirely or mostly north, but in county terms, we consider their general position.

Based on county seats: McMinnville (Yamhill) at 45.21° N, Oregon City (Clackamas) at 45.34° N, so Yamhill's seat is south.

Moreover, the centroid or average position would likely show Yamhill south of Clackamas.

I can think of driving: to go from Yamhill to Clackamas, you might go north-east, indicating Yamhill is south-west.

From McMinnville to Oregon City, you drive north-east, so Yamhill is south of Clackamas.

Therefore, Yamhill County is not north of Clackamas County; it's south and west.

So the answer should be No.

But to be thorough, is there any part of Yamhill that is north of some part of Clackamas? Probably not, since Clackamas extends north to the boundary with Multnomah, while Yamhill's north is with Washington, which is west.

Washington County is north of Yamhill and west of Multnomah, so the northern tip of Yamhill might be at similar latitude to southern Clackamas, but still, Clackamas has parts further north.

For example, the city of Happy Valley in Clackamas is near Portland, at higher latitude.

Whereas Yamhill's highest is around Forest Grove area or something, but Forest Grove is in Washington County, not Yamhill.

Yamhill's cities like Lafayette, Dayton, are south.

So overall, Yamhill County is not located north of Clackamas County.

Final answer: No.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if Yamhill County, OR is located north of Clackamas County, OR, I will reason step by step based on geographical knowledge of Oregon's counties.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the locations of the counties:**
   - Clackamas County is in northwestern Oregon, southeast of Portland. Its county seat is Oregon City, located at approximately 45.34° N latitude. Clackamas County extends from the southern boundary of Multnomah County (which borders the Columbia River) southward and eastward, covering areas in the Willamette Valley and Cascade foothills.
   - Yamhill County is also in northwestern Oregon, but it is southwest of Portland. Its county seat is McMinnville, located at approximately 45.21° N latitude. Yamhill County is bordered by Washington County to the north, Polk County to the south, and Marion County to the east, and it lies primarily in the western part of the Willamette Valley.

2. **Compare latitudes (north-south position):**
   - Latitude is a key indicator for north-south positioning. Clackamas County's northern boundary is with Multnomah County, starting around 45.4° N or higher in some areas, and it extends southward. Yamhill County's northern boundary is with Washington County, with its highest latitude around 45.3° N (e.g., near Newberg at about 45.30° N).
   - Comparing the county seats: Oregon City (Clackamas) is at 45.34° N, while McMinnville (Yamhill) is at 45.21° N. This indicates that Yamhill's seat is south of Clackamas's seat.
   - Even considering the full extent of the counties, Clackamas County's northern parts extend closer to or beyond 45.4° N, while Yamhill County's highest points are generally at or below 45.3° N. This suggests that no part of Yamhill County is north of the northernmost parts of Clackamas County.

3. **Consider relative positioning (east-west and overall direction):**
   - Yamhill County is west and slightly south of Clackamas County. For example, traveling from McMinnville (Yamhill) to Oregon City (Clackamas) generally involves moving northeast, confirming that Yamhill is not north but rather southwest.
   - The two counties do not share a direct border; they are separated by other counties (e.g., Marion County to the east of Yamhill and Washington County to the north). This spatial separation further supports that Yamhill is not positioned north of Clackamas.

4. **Evaluate the general question:**
   - The query asks if Yamhill County is "located north of" Clackamas County. For one county to be considered north of another, it should generally have higher latitudes or be positioned such that its area is predominantly or entirely north. Based on the latitude comparisons and relative geography, Yamhill County is not north of Clackamas County; instead, it is south and west.

### Final Answer:
No
