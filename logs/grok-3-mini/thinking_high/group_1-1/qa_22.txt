*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Lake Martin, AL located south of Dal-Tex Building, TX?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to understand the locations. Lake Martin is in Alabama, and Dal-Tex Building is in Texas. The Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, Texas, as it's a famous building related to the Kennedy assassination. So, Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, TX.

Lake Martin is in Alabama. I believe it's a reservoir in Alabama, probably near Alexander City or something like that. I should confirm the general location.

To determine if Lake Martin, AL is south of Dal-Tex Building, TX, I need to compare their latitudes. If Lake Martin's latitude is lower than that of the Dal-Tex Building, then it's south.

So, step 1: Find the approximate latitude of Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, TX.

Dallas, Texas is in the southern United States. I know that Dallas is around 32.7767° N latitude. That's standard knowledge.

Step 2: Find the approximate latitude of Lake Martin in Alabama.

Alabama is also in the south, but I need to know where Lake Martin is. Lake Martin is in east-central Alabama. I think it's around 32.9° N or something. Wait, I need to recall or estimate.

Actually, I should think about the general latitudes.

- Dallas, TX: Approximately 32.8° N

- Alabama: The state spans from about 30° N to 35° N, but most of it is around 33° N in the central part.

Lake Martin is specifically in Tallapoosa County, Alabama. I think it's near Alexander City, which is in central Alabama.

Upon thinking, central Alabama is around 33° N latitude. For example, Montgomery, AL is about 32.366° N, and Birmingham is about 33.52° N.

Lake Martin is east of Montgomery, so probably similar latitude.

I think Lake Martin is at approximately 32.9° N. But let me confirm my knowledge.

Since both are in the south, I need precise comparison.

Dallas is at 32.78° N, and Lake Martin: let's say Alexander City, AL is around 32.94° N or something. I need to be accurate.

I can think relatively.

Texas is west of Alabama, and both are at similar latitudes, but Dallas might be slightly north or south.

Alabama's northern part is up to 35° N, southern part 30° N. Dallas is at 32.8° N.

Birmingham, AL is at 33.5° N, which is north of Dallas.

Lake Martin is south of Birmingham. Birmingham is in northern Alabama, Lake Martin is in central or eastern Alabama.

Alexander City, where Lake Martin is, is south of Birmingham.

Birmingham is 33.5° N, Montgomery is 32.4° N, and Alexander City is between them or south.

Upon better recollection, Alexander City, AL is approximately at 32.95° N latitude.

Dallas, TX is at 32.78° N.

32.95° N vs 32.78° N. 32.95 is higher than 32.78, so Lake Martin is at a higher latitude, which means it's north of Dallas.

Latitude increases as you go north, so higher latitude means farther north.

If Lake Martin is at 32.95° N and Dal-Tex Building in Dallas is at 32.78° N, then Lake Martin is north of Dallas.

But the question is about south. So if it's north, then it's not south.

Are my latitude estimates correct?

Let me double-check.

Dallas, TX latitude: yes, about 32.78° N.

Now, Lake Martin, AL: Lake Martin is a reservoir on the Tallapoosa River in Alabama. Its center or main area is around Alexander City.

Alexander City, AL latitude: I think it's approximately 32.944° N.

Yes, looking back, 32.944° N for Alexander City.

Dallas is 32.776° N for the city center.

So, 32.944 > 32.776, so Lake Martin is at a higher latitude, thus north of Dallas.

But Dallas is west, and Lake Martin is east, but latitude-wise, it's north.

The question is only about south, which is a north-south comparison, not considering longitude.

To be south, it must have a lower latitude.

Since 32.944° N > 32.776° N, Lake Martin is north of Dal-Tex Building.

Therefore, it is not south.

But is Dal-Tex Building exactly at Dallas coordinates? I think it's in downtown Dallas, so same latitude.

Now, just to be thorough, are there any tricks? Like, is Lake Martin extending to lower latitudes? But generally, we consider the main location.

Perhaps I should confirm the exact locations.

But based on this, Lake Martin is north of Dallas.

Alabama is east of Texas, and both are in the south, but Alabama curves up a bit.

The panhandle of Texas is north, but Dallas is central Texas.

From Dallas to Alabama, moving east, you might cross similar latitudes, but since Alabama is slightly north in parts.

Montgomery, AL is at 32.37° N, which is south of Dallas's 32.78° N? No: 32.37 < 32.78, so Montgomery is south of Dallas.

Latitude: lower number means south.

32.37° N is less than 32.78° N, so Montgomery, AL is at a lower latitude, thus south of Dallas, TX.

But earlier I said Lake Martin is near Alexander City.

Alexander City, AL: let me recall accurately.

Upon second thought, Montgomery is at 32.366° N, Dallas at 32.776° N.

Alexander City is northeast of Montgomery.

Montgomery is central, Alexander City is in Tallapoosa County, which is east of Montgomery.

As you go east in Alabama, latitude might change.

Birmingham is north at 33.52° N, Montgomery south at 32.37° N.

Alexander City: I think it's around 33° N or so.

Let's think: distance from Montgomery to Birmingham is north, about 90 miles, latitude difference from 32.37 to 33.52 is about 1.15 degrees.

Alexander City is roughly 50 miles northeast of Montgomery, so it should be a bit north.

Calculating roughly: 50 miles northeast, northeast is 45 degrees, so north component is 50 * cos(45) ≈ 50 * 0.707 ≈ 35.35 miles north.

1 degree latitude is about 69 miles, so 35.35 miles / 69 ≈ 0.512 degrees north.

So Montgomery 32.366° N, plus 0.512 ≈ 32.878° N for Alexander City.

Earlier I thought 32.944, but now calculation gives around 32.88° N.

Perhaps I misremembered.

I think Alexander City is at approximately 32.94° N? No, let me correct.

Upon better memory, I think Montgomery is 32.38° N, and Alexander City is at 32.95° N? I'm confusing myself.

Perhaps I should use standard knowledge.

I recall that Lake Martin is at about 32.9° N, but let's assume standard values.

I can think of cities: Auburn, AL is near there, Auburn is at 32.60° N, which is south.

Auburn University is at 32.609° N, and Alexander City is north of that.

Alexander City is about 30 miles west of Auburn, but Auburn is at 32.60° N, and moving west might not change latitude much, but Alexander City is actually a bit north.

Upon thinking, I believe Alexander City, AL is at approximately 32.944° N latitude and 85.953° W longitude.

Dallas, TX is at 32.776° N and 96.797° W.

So latitude: Alexander City 32.944° N, Dallas 32.776° N.

32.944 > 32.776, so Alexander City (and thus Lake Martin) is at higher latitude, so north of Dallas.

Difference is about 0.168 degrees, which is about 0.168 * 69 ≈ 11.6 miles north.

So yes, Lake Martin is north of Dal-Tex Building in Dallas.

Therefore, it is not south.

The question is "located south of", so since it's north, the answer should be No.

But earlier I thought about Montgomery being south, but Lake Martin is not Montgomery; it's northeast, so higher latitude.

To confirm, longitude: Dallas is at 96.8° W, Lake Martin at 85.95° W, so Lake Martin is east, but for north-south, only latitude matters.

So, final reasoning: Latitude of Lake Martin ≈ 32.94° N, latitude of Dal-Tex Building ≈ 32.78° N. Since 32.94 > 32.78, Lake Martin is north, not south.

Thus, the answer is No.

To determine if Lake Martin, AL is located south of the Dal-Tex Building, TX, I will compare their latitudes, as latitude determines north-south position (lower latitude means farther south, higher latitude means farther north). I'll use approximate coordinates based on standard geographic data.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations:**
   - Lake Martin is a reservoir in Alabama, primarily near Alexander City in Tallapoosa County.
   - The Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, Texas, specifically in downtown Dallas, and is associated with historical events like the Kennedy assassination.

2. **Find the approximate latitudes:**
   - Latitude of Lake Martin (near Alexander City, AL): Approximately 32.944° N.
   - Latitude of Dal-Tex Building (in Dallas, TX): Approximately 32.776° N (based on Dallas city center coordinates, as the Dal-Tex Building is located there).

3. **Compare the latitudes:**
   - 32.944° N (Lake Martin) vs. 32.776° N (Dal-Tex Building).
   - Since 32.944° N is greater than 32.776° N, Lake Martin is at a higher latitude.
   - Higher latitude means farther north, so Lake Martin is north of the Dal-Tex Building.

4. **Determine the answer to the question:**
   - The question asks if Lake Martin is located south of the Dal-Tex Building.
   - Since Lake Martin is north (not south), the answer is no.

### Final Answer:
No
