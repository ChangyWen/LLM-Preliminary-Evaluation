*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Cambria County, PA located west of Cattaraugus County, NY?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

To determine if one location is west of another, I need to compare their geographical positions. Specifically, I need to know the longitude of both counties because longitude lines run north-south, and locations with lower longitude values are west of those with higher longitude values.

I should recall or look up the approximate locations of these counties.

Cambria County is in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is on the East Coast of the US. I think Cambria County is in western Pennsylvania. I recall that Pittsburgh is in western PA, and Cambria County might be near there. Actually, I think Cambria County is around Johnstown, which is in central-western PA.

Cattaraugus County is in New York. New York State has counties like New York County (Manhattan), but Cattaraugus sounds familiar – I think it's in western New York, near the Pennsylvania border. I believe Cattaraugus County is in the southwestern part of New York, bordering Pennsylvania.

Both counties are near each other, possibly sharing a border or being close.

If Cattaraugus County is in western NY and Cambria County is in western PA, I need to see which one is further west.

Pennsylvania is west of New York State. New York City is on the coast, but the state extends west to include areas like Buffalo, which is near the western border.

Buffalo is in Erie County, NY, which is adjacent to Cattaraugus County. Cattaraugus County is south of Erie County, still in western NY.

Cambria County, PA: Johnstown is in Cambria County, and Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is at about 80° W longitude.

Approximate longitudes:

- New York City is around 74° W.

- Buffalo, NY is further west, around 78.8° W or so.

- Pittsburgh, PA is around 80° W.

Cattaraugus County, NY: Since it's south of Buffalo, it should be around the same longitude, maybe 78-79° W.

Cambria County, PA: Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is about 80° W, and Johnstown might be a bit east, say 78.5° W or something. Wait, no.

Actually, I think I'm confusing it. Let me think: Pennsylvania's longitude decreases as you go east. Longitude increases as you go west? No: in the Western Hemisphere, longitude is measured west, so higher numbers are further west.

Standard longitude: 0° is Greenwich, and in the US, it goes from about 75° W on the East Coast to about 125° W on the West Coast.

So, lower longitude (e.g., 75° W) is east, higher longitude (e.g., 90° W) is west.

Correction: in the longitude system, a smaller numerical value (like 75° W) is east of a larger numerical value (like 80° W). No:

Longitude is measured in degrees west or east from Greenwich. So, 75° W is west of 70° W, meaning 75° W is further west than 70° W.

Let's clarify:

- A location with longitude 75° W is west of a location with 70° W, because 75 is greater than 70, so it's further west.

Yes: higher degree west means further west.

For example, New York City is about 74° W, Washington DC is about 77° W, so DC is west of NYC.

Chicago is about 87.6° W, which is further west.

Now, back to the counties.

First, Cattaraugus County, NY: It's in western New York. Buffalo is in Erie County, NY, and Buffalo is approximately 78.878° W.

Cattaraugus County is south of that, but probably similar longitude. I think it's around 78-79° W.

Now, Cambria County, PA: Johnstown, PA is in Cambria County. I think Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh is about 79.99° W or roughly 80° W.

Johnstown is about 40 miles east of Pittsburgh, I think. Actually, I'm not sure about the distance, but geographically, moving east decreases longitude.

If Pittsburgh is 80° W, and Johnstown is east of it, then Johnstown should have a smaller longitude value, like 78.8° W or something.

Longitude decreases as you go east.

Standard: east is lower longitude numbers in the west hemisphere.

So, if Pittsburgh is at 80° W, a place east of it would have, say, 79° W or less.

Actually, let's think of real values.

I recall that Philadelphia is about 75.16° W, and Pittsburgh is about 79.98° W. So Pittsburgh is further west than Philadelphia.

Now, Johnstown, PA: I think it's between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. Harrisburg is around 76.88° W, I think.

Perhaps I can estimate.

I know that the Pennsylvania-New York border: New York is to the north, Pennsylvania to the south.

Western New York and western Pennsylvania.

Cattaraugus County, NY, borders Pennsylvania. Specifically, it borders McKean County and Potter County in PA, I think.

Now, which is further west?

Let me think about the cities.

Buffalo, NY is at the eastern end of Lake Erie, and Erie, PA is at the western end of Pennsylvania on Lake Erie.

Erie, PA is in northwestern PA, and it's very close to the border.

Erie, PA longitude is about 80.08° W.

Buffalo, NY is across the lake, but slightly east, around 78.88° W? No.

Lake Erie is oriented such that Buffalo is at the eastern tip, so Buffalo should have lower longitude (more east) than Erie, PA.

Longitude: Buffalo, NY is approximately 78.878° W.

Erie, PA is approximately 80.085° W.

Yes, so Erie, PA is west of Buffalo, NY.

Now, Cattaraugus County, NY is south of Buffalo, so it might be a bit west or east.

Actually, Cattaraugus County extends south from Erie County (which includes Buffalo), and it might have longitudes from about 78.5° W to 79° W or so. I think parts of it are around 78.7° W.

But let's find a specific point. The county seat of Cattaraugus County is Little Valley, I think, which is around 78.8° W or something.

Now, Cambria County, PA: County seat is Ebensburg, I think. Johnstown is a city in it.

Johnstown, PA longitude is approximately 78.92° W.

Pittsburgh is 79.99° W, Johnstown is east of Pittsburgh, so less than 80.

Actually, upon recollection, Johnstown, PA is at about 78.9167° W latitude and 40.3264° N longitude? Longitude is 78.92° W.

Standard coordinates: Johnstown, PA is roughly 78.92° W.

Buffalo, NY is 78.878° W, but that's for Buffalo city.

Cattaraugus County spans longitudes. The western part of Cattaraugus County might be further west.

Cattaraugus County, NY, its western border is with Chautauqua County, NY, which is even further west.

Chautauqua County includes Jamestown, NY, which is west of Buffalo.

Jamestown, NY is around 79.25° W or so.

Buffalo is 78.878° W, which is east of, say, Erie, PA at 80.085° W.

Longitude increases west, so higher number is west.

Buffalo, NY: 78.878° W

Erie, PA: 80.085° W, so Erie is west of Buffalo.

Cattaraugus County, NY is south of Erie County, NY. Erie County, NY has Buffalo at 78.878° W, but the county extends west to the county line.

Erie County, NY is bounded on the west by Niagara County and Cattaraugus? No, Erie County is the county containing Buffalo, and to the west is Niagara County, then Chautauqua County is further south and west.

Cattaraugus County is south of Erie County.

Looking at a map in my mind: New York State, western part: from north to south, Niagara County, Erie County (Buffalo), then Cattaraugus County below that.

Cattaraugus County is directly south of Erie County, so similar longitude.

Erie County, NY longitudes range from about 78.5° W to 79.2° W or something. Buffalo is at the eastern part.

Actually, Erie County, NY: westernmost point might be near the Niagara River.

But Cattaraugus County: its eastern part is near 78.5° W, western part near 79° W or so.

I found online or recall that the average or central longitude for Cattaraugus County is around 78.7° W to 79° W.

For Cambria County, PA: Johnstown is at 78.9167° W, and it's in the central part.

Now, compare to Cattaraugus County.

The western part of Cattaraugus County borders Pennsylvania, and I think it includes areas around 78.8° W to 79.2° W.

Actually, the town of Olean in Cattaraugus County is at about 78.43° W? I'm not sure.

Perhaps I can think that Pennsylvania's western counties are further west.

Erie, PA is at 80.085° W, which is in northwestern PA.

Cambria County is south of there, in central PA.

From Erie to Johnstown: Erie is north, Johnstown is south-southeast.

Longitude of Johnstown is less than Erie.

Erie, PA: 80.085° W

Johnstown, PA: 78.92° W, so Johnstown is east of Erie, PA.

Now, Cattaraugus County, NY: let's take a point. The city of Salamanca in Cattaraugus County is near the PA border.

Salamanca, NY is at approximately 78.7167° W longitude.

I think Buffalo is 78.878° W, and moving south, it might be similar.

Upon better recollection, the longitude of western New York is around 78-79° W, and western PA has longitudes from 80° W in the northwest to less in the east.

Cambria County is in south-central PA, so its longitude should be around 78-79° W.

Specifically, Cambria County longitudes range from about 78.5° W to 78.9° W or so.

Cattaraugus County, NY longitudes range from about 78.4° W to 79.0° W, I think.

But let's compare the western and eastern extents.

To determine if Cambria County is west of Cattaraugus County, I need to see if all parts of Cambria are west of all parts of Cattaraugus, or typically, we compare their positions, often using the county seats or centroids.

Generally, if the average longitude of Cambria is less or greater.

Longitude value: higher number means further west.

So, if Cambria has higher longitude than Cattaraugus, then Cambria is west of Cattaraugus.

No: higher longitude west means further west, so if Cambria has higher longitude number, it is further west.

For example, 80° W is west of 79° W.

So, compare longitude values: the one with larger numerical value (more degrees west) is further west.

So, I need to find which county has higher average longitude.

First, Cattaraugus County, NY: let's estimate its central longitude.

County seat is Little Valley, NY, which is at approximately 78.80° W longitude (I'm guessing, but let's assume around 78.8° W).

Actually, upon thinking, Buffalo is 78.878° W, and Cattaraugus is south, but similar.

I can recall that the PA-NY border in that area: Pennsylvania extends further west.

For example, Erie, PA is at 80.085° W, while the eastern part of New York is less.

But Cattaraugus County is in the west of NY.

Let's think about the border.

The westernmost point of New York State is in Chautauqua County, around 79.25° W or so for Dunkirk.

Dunkirk, NY is at 79.333° W.

Cattaraugus County is east of that, so less longitude.

Cattaraugus County's western border is with Chautauqua County, so it might have longitudes up to 79° W or so.

Eastern part around 78.5° W.

Now, Cambria County, PA: its western border is with Indiana County, PA, and eastern with Blair County.

Pittsburgh is at 79.99° W, and Johnstown is east of that.

Johnstown, PA is at 78.9167° W longitude.

Ebensburg, county seat, is at about 78.72° W or something. Let's assume around 78.8° W.

I think Johnstown is at 78.92° W, but that's for latitude? No, longitude.

Standard coordinates: Johnstown, PA is approximately 40.3264° N latitude, 78.9186° W longitude.

Yes, 78.9186° W.

Now for Cattaraugus County: let's take the county seat, Little Valley, NY.

Little Valley is at approximately 42.25° N, 78.80° W or something.

Upon recollection, Little Valley, NY is at about 42.248° N, 78.798° W.

So, longitude 78.798° W.

Cambria County's county seat is Ebensburg, PA, at approximately 40.485° N, 78.725° W.

Ebensburg, PA longitude is about 78.725° W.

Johnstown is at 78.9186° W, which is within Cambria County.

Cambria County spans from about 78.6° W to 78.9° W or so.

Little Valley, NY (Cattaraugus County seat) is at 78.798° W.

Ebensburg, PA (Cambria County seat) is at 78.725° W.

78.725° W vs 78.798° W.

Since 78.798 > 78.725, that means 78.798° W is further west than 78.725° W.

Longitude: higher number means further west.

78.798° W is greater than 78.725° W, so Little Valley (Cattaraugus Co., NY) is at 78.798° W, which is west of Ebensburg (Cambria Co., PA) at 78.725° W.

If Cattaraugus County seat is at higher longitude (78.798° W) than Cambria County seat (78.725° W), that means Cattaraugus is further west.

The question is: is Cambria County west of Cattaraugus County?

If Cambria has lower longitude, it is east of Cattaraugus.

From the seat comparison: Ebensburg at 78.725° W, Little Valley at 78.798° W, so 78.725 < 78.798, so Ebensburg is east of Little Valley.

But counties have area, so I need to see the overall position.

Cattaraugus County might extend further west.

The western part of Cattaraugus County: it goes west to the county line with Chautauqua County.

Chautauqua County has longitudes up to about 79.3° W.

Cattaraugus County's westernmost point is around 78.9° W or so.

For example, the town of Randolph in Cattaraugus County is at about 79.00° W.

Assuming Cattaraugus County longitudes from 78.4° W east to 79.0° W west.

Cambria County: easternmost around 78.5° W, westernmost around 78.9° W or less.

Johnstown is at 78.92° W, but that's within it.

Cambria County's western border is near Nanty Glo or something, but longitude might be around 78.8° W to 78.9° W max.

Earlier Ebensburg is 78.725° W, Johnstown is 78.9186° W, so Cambria County spans from about 78.6° W to 78.95° W or so.

Now Cattaraugus County: Little Valley at 78.798° W, but western parts.

The western edge of Cattaraugus County is near the Allegheny River, and I think it reaches about 78.95° W or higher.

Upon better thought, let's consider that Pennsylvania's western panhandle or areas.

Actually, I think Cattaraugus County extends to longitudes around 78.7° W to 79.2° W.

I found a better way: I know that the city of Olean, NY in Cattaraugus County is at approximately 78.427° W? No, that can't be right because Buffalo is 78.878° W.

Olean is south of Buffalo, but should be similar longitude.

Olean, NY is at about 42.0778° N, 78.4297° W? 78.43° W seems too low.

I think I have it wrong.

Standard: New York longitudes: Albany is 73.75° W, Syracuse 76.15° W, Rochester 77.6° W, Buffalo 78.88° W.

Olean, NY: I think it's around 78.4° W? Let's calculate.

Actually, upon correction, Olean, NY is at approximately 42.08° N, 78.43° W is incorrect; I think it's 78.43° W is too east.

78.43° W is east of Buffalo? No, Buffalo is 78.88° W, so 78.43° W is less, so east.

Longitude decreases east, so 78.43° W is east of 78.88° W? No: 78.43° W vs 78.88° W: 78.88 is greater, so 78.88° W is west of 78.43° W.

Numerically, 78.88 > 78.43, so 78.88° W is further west.

But Olean is south of Buffalo, but in the same area, so it should be similar or slightly west.

I think Olean is at about 78.42° W? That would be east.

I think I have the number wrong.

Upon recollection, Buffalo is at -78.878, which is 78.878° W.

Olean is at approximately -78.70° W or something. Let's assume it's around 78.7° W.

Actually, looking it up in my mind, Olean, NY longitude is about 78.4297° W? That can't be, because that would be east of Syracuse.

Syracuse is 76.15° W, Rochester 77.61° W, Buffalo 78.88° W, so Olean should be around 78.5-79° W.

I found online memory: Olean, NY is at 42.0833° N, 78.4167° W? 78.4167° W.

78.4167° W vs Buffalo's 78.878° W: 78.4167 < 78.878, so 78.4167° W is east of 78.878° W, but that doesn't make sense geographically because Olean is south of Buffalo, but not east or west significantly.

Perhaps I have the longitude wrong.

I think I confused it.

Actual longitude: Buffalo, NY is at approximately 78.878° W.

Olean, NY is at approximately 78.43° W? Let's think: if Buffalo is 78.878, and Olean is south, but in Cattaraugus County, it should be similar.

Upon correct recollection, Olean, NY is at about 42.08° N, 78.43° W is incorrect; I think it's 78.43° W is a mistake.

Standard: longitude for Olean is around 78.4° W, but that would be 78.4, while Buffalo is 78.8, so difference of 0.4 degrees, which is about 24 miles, so if Olean is east, it could be.

Actually, yes, Olean is east of Buffalo. Buffalo is at the western end of Erie County, Olean is in the eastern part of Cattaraugus County.

Cattaraugus County is south of Erie County, but Erie County is wide.

Erie County, NY: from Buffalo in the east to the Niagara River in the west.

Buffalo is at the eastern part of Lake Erie, so Erie County extends from about 78.5° W to 79.0° W or something.

Buffalo city is at 78.878° W, but the western part of Erie County is near Grand Island, around 78.9° W or more.

The Niagara River is at about 79.0° W for some parts.

Cattaraugus County is south of that, and its eastern part is near 78.4° W, western part near 79.0° W.

For example, the town of Allegany in Cattaraugus County is near 78.5° W, and western part near 78.9° W.

Now for Cambria County, PA: longitudes from about 78.6° W to 78.9° W.

Specifically, the westernmost point of Cambria County is around 78.85° W or so, and eastern at 78.6° W.

Cattaraugus County's westernmost point is around 79.0° W, which is higher than Cambria's 78.85° W, so Cattaraugus extends further west.

For example, the western border of Cattaraugus County is at about 78.95° W or higher.

Whereas Cambria County's western border is with Indiana County, and Johnstown is at 78.92° W, but Indiana County goes west to Pittsburgh area, but Cambria is east.

Indiana County, PA has Indiana, PA at about 79.15° W, so Cambria County's western border is at about 78.9° W or less.

Let's clarify.

Pittsburgh is at 79.99° W, Johnstown is at 78.92° W, but 78.92 is less than 79.99, so John 78.92° W is east of Pittsburgh 79.99° W.

Distance: from Pittsburgh to Johnstown is about 60 miles east, and longitude difference: 79.99 - 78.92 = 1.07 degrees, and 1 degree longitude at that latitude is about 69 miles, so 1.07*69 ≈ 74 miles, close to 60 miles, so yes.

Now, for Cattaraugus County: the western part is near the Chautauqua County line.

Chautauqua County has Jamestown, NY at approximately 79.23° W.

Cattaraugus County borders Chautauqua, so its western longitudes are around 79.0° W to 79.2° W.

For example, the town of Napoli in Cattaraugus County is at about 78.98° W or something.

Assuming the westernmost longitude of Cattaraugus County is about 79.0° W.

Cambria County's westernmost longitude is less, say 78.9° W or 78.85° W.

78.9 < 79.0, so 78.9° W is east of 79.0° W.

So, the westernmost part of Cambria is at lower longitude than the westernmost of Cattaraugus, so Cambria is east of Cattaraugus in that sense.

But to be precise, let's compare the centroids or typical positions.

From the county seats: Ebensburg, PA at 78.725° W, Little Valley, NY at 78.798° W, so 78.725 < 78.798, so Ebensburg is east of Little Valley.

Moreover, Cambria County is in Pennsylvania, which at that latitude is east of western New York.

Pennsylvania's western border is with Ohio, at around 80.5° W for Erie, but Cambria is further east.

Cattaraugus is in New York, which extends to 79.3° W.

So, generally, Cambria County is located east of Cattaraugus County.

Therefore, it is not west of it.

So the answer should be No.

But let's confirm with a simple thought: New York State is generally east of Pennsylvania? No, New York State has parts west of Pennsylvania.

Western New York is west of eastern Pennsylvania, but Cambria is in western PA, Cattaraugus in western NY.

From map knowledge, if I imagine the US map, New York's western tip is at the same longitude as Ohio, while Pennsylvania's western border is also with Ohio.

But specifically, Cattaraugus County is in the southwest of NY, and Cambria is in south-central PA.

The line between them: the PA-NY border is straight, and at that border, the longitudes are similar, but Cattaraugus is north, and its western parts are further west.

But since Cambria is south and slightly east, I think it's east.

I can think of cities: Johnstown, PA is east of Olean, NY or something.

Olean, NY longitude: upon correct recall, Olean is at approximately 78.43° W? Earlier confusion.

Actual longitude: Olean, NY is at 42.0833° N, 78.4167° W? 78.4167° W.

Buffalo is at 78.878° W, which is west of 78.4167° W? 78.878 > 78.4167, so 78.878° W is west of 78.4167° W.

Numerically larger, so further west.

But geographically, Olean is south of Buffalo, but if Olean is at 78.42° W and Buffalo at 78.88° W, that would mean Olean is east of Buffalo by about 0.46 degrees, which is about 28 miles, and the distance from Buffalo to Olean is about 60 miles south, so it could be slightly east.

Yes, Olean is southeast of Buffalo, so yes, at lower longitude.

So Olean at 78.42° W, Johnstown at 78.92° W, 78.92 > 78.42, so Johnstown is west of Olean.

78.92° W vs 78.42° W: 78.92 > 78.42, so 78.92° W is further west than 78.42° W.

Longitude: higher number means further west, so 78.92° W is west of 78.42° W.

But Olean is at 78.42° W, Johnstown at 78.92° W, so Johnstown is west of Olean.

Olean is in Cattaraugus County, eastern part, and Johnstown is in Cambria County.

But Cattaraugus County also has western parts at higher longitude.

For example, the western part of Cattaraugus County, like the town of Conewango, is at about 79.0° W or so.

Upon checking mental database, the longitude range for Cattaraugus County is from approximately 78.4° W to 79.2° W.

For Cambria County, from 78.6° W to 78.9° W or 79.0° W.

Johnstown is at 78.92° W, and the western border might be at 78.95° W or less.

Cambria County's western longitude is up to 78.95° W, while Cattaraugus County's eastern longitude is 78.4° W, but western is 79.2° W.

So, the westernmost of Cambria is at 78.95° W, easternmost of Cattaraugus is at 78.4° W, so 78.95 > 78.4, so some parts of Cambria are west of some parts of Cattaraugus.

This is messy.

To determine if one county is west of another, we usually mean if it is entirely west or generally located west.

In standard geographical terms, we can compare their centroid longitudes.

For Cattaraugus County, NY, centroid longitude is approximately 78.7° W.

For Cambria County, PA, centroid longitude is approximately 78.7° W or slightly less.

From online knowledge or estimation, Cambria County centroid is at about 78.7° W, Cattaraugus at 78.8° W or something.

Earlier seat: Ebensburg 78.725° W, Little Valley 78.798° W, so similar.

But 78.725 < 78.798, so Cambria seat is at lower longitude.

Moreover, Pennsylvania at that latitude is generally east of New York's western counties.

Let's think of the state borders.

The PA-NY border is at around 42° N, and at that latitude, the longitude of the border is around 78.5° W to 79.5° W or something.

But specifically, the point where PA and NY border, the longitudes vary.

Perhaps it's easier to note that Cambria County is not adjacent to Cattaraugus County; there are counties in between.

Cattaraugus County, NY borders Potter County and McKean County in PA.

McKean County, PA is north of Cameron and Elk counties, and Cambria is south of Clearfield and Indiana counties.

So, McKean County, PA is adjacent to Cattaraugus.

McKean County, PA county seat is Smethport at approximately 78.44° W or something.

Smethport, PA is at 41.81° N, 78.44° W.

Longitude 78.44° W.

Cattaraugus County's eastern part is at similar longitude.

Cambria County is south, at Johnstown 78.92° W.

From Smethport at 78.44° W to Johnstown at 78.92° W, 78.92 > 78.44, so John  -- 78.92° W is west of 78.44° W.

So McKean County at 78.44° W, Cambria at 78.92° W, so Cambria is west of McK  -- McKean County.

McKean County is adjacent to Cattaraugus, so if McKean is at 78.44° W and Cattaraugus has parts at 79.2° W, then Cattaraugus extends further west.

For example, the western part of Cattaraugus is at 79.2° W, while Cambria is at 78.92° W, so 79.2 > 78.92, so western Cattaraugus is west of Cambria.

The eastern part of Cattaraugus at 78.4° W is east of Cambria's 78.92° W.

So, the counties overlap in longitude; some parts of Cambria are west of some parts of Cattaraugus, and vice versa.

But typically, when we say "located west of," we mean the general position or the centroid.

From the centroid: let's assume Cattaraugus centroid longitude is about 78.8° W, Cambria at 78.7° W, so Cambria is slightly east.

I can think that Cambria County is closer to the east, while Cattaraugus is in the west.

Perhaps I can use the fact that Pittsburgh is at 80° W, and Buffalo at 78.8° W, but Pittsburgh is in PA, Buffalo in NY.

Pittsburgh is west of Buffalo: 80 > 78.8, yes.

But Cambria is east of Pittsburgh, Cattaraugus is south of Buffalo.

Distance-wise, from a reference point.

Perhaps the simplest way is to note that Cambria County is in central PA, while Cattaraugus is in western NY, and western NY is generally west of central PA.

Central PA: Harrisburg is at 76.88° W, which is east.

Cambria is western PA, but not the westernmost.

Let's compare to a common reference.

The Mississippi River is at 90° W, but that's far.

From Washington DC at 77° W.

DC at 77° W, Buffalo at 78.88° W, so Buffalo is west of DC.

Johnstown at 78.92° W, also west of DC.

But 78.92 vs 78.88, 78.92 > 78.88, so Johnstown is west of Buffalo.

Buff 78.88° W, Johnstown 78.92° W, so Johnstown is at higher longitude, so further west.

78.92 > 78.88, yes, so Johnstown is west of Buffalo.

But Buffalo is in Erie County, Cattaraugus is south, with parts east and west.

The center of Cattaraugus is at Little Valley 78.798° W, Johnstown 78.92° W, so 78.92 > 78.798, so Johnstown is west of Little Valley.

78.92 > 78.798, yes, 78.92 is larger, so further west.

78.92 vs 78.798: 78.92 is 78.920, 78.798 is 78.798, so 78.920 > 78.798, yes, so 78.920° W is west of 78.798° W.

Longitude increases west, so higher number is west.

So Johnstown at 78.92° W is west of Little Valley at 78.798° W.

But Little Valley is the seat of Cattaraugus, but Cattaraugus has parts at 79.2° W, which is even further west.

For example, Jamestown, NY in Chautau  County is at 79.23° W, and Cattaraugus borders it, so some parts of Cattaraugus are at 79.1° W or so.

 79.1 > 78.92, so those parts are west of Johnstown.

Some parts of Cattaraugus are west of Cambria, some are east.

For the county as a whole, the average might be similar.

To answer the question, "is Cambria County located west of Cattaraugus County," I think the intended meaning is if it is generally or entirely west, and from the positions, it's not entirely west, and perhaps not generally.

But from the seat comparison, Ebensburg at 78.725° W, Little Valley at 78.798° W, so Ebensburg is at 78.725, which is less than 78.798, so 78.725° W is east of 78.798° W.

So Ebensburg is east of Little Valley.

Johnstown at 78.92° W is west of Little Valley at 78.798° W.

This is inconsistent.

Ebensburg is the county seat of Cambria, at 78.725° W, Johnstown is also in Cambria at 78.92° W, so Cambria County has a range.

Cattaraugus has a range.

Perhaps the centroid of Cambria County is at about 78.8° W, Cattaraugus at 78.8° W.

But to make a decision, I think Cambria County is not located west of Cattaraug  County; it is roughly at the same longitude or slightly east.

I can think that Cambria County is in PA, and Cattaraugus is in NY, and NY is east, but western NY is west.

Perhaps the best way is to use a map or known fact.

Upon final thought, I recall that Pennsylvania's western border is with Ohio, at 80.5° W for some parts, while New York's western border is at 79.3° W, so PA extends further west.

But Cambria County is not in the westernmost part; it is in the east of western PA.

Cattaraugus is in the west of NY.

So, for example, the longitude of Cambria is around 78.8° W, while the western NY is 79.2° W, but the eastern part of Cattaraugus is 78.4° W.

Perhaps on average, they are similar.

But for the question, I think the answer is no, Cambria is not west of Cattaraugus.

Let's assume from the seat: if we take the county seats, Ebensburg at 78.725° W, Little Valley at 78.798° W, so 78.725 < 78.798, so Ebensburg is east of Little Valley, so Cambria is not west of Cattaraugus.

Moreover, the main city Johnstown at 78.92° W is west of Little Valley, but the county as a whole is not entirely west.

I think the standard answer is that Cambria County is not located west of Cattaraugus County.

Perhaps the answer is No.

I can think of the states: PA is west of NY in some parts, but for these counties, it's close.

But I think the final answer is No.

So I'll go with No. 

Step-by-step: I compared the longitudes of the county seats: Ebensburg, PA at 78.725° W and Little Valley, NY at 78.798° W. Since 78.725 < 78.798, Ebensburg is east of Little Valley, so Cambria County is not west of Cattaraugus County.

Final answer: No. 

To be thorough, since the question is about the county as a whole, and based on typical location, it's not west.

So,  \boxed{\text{No}} 

Yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if Cambria County, PA is located west of Cattaraugus County, NY, I will compare their geographical positions using longitude, as longitude determines east-west positioning (higher longitude values indicate further west in the Western Hemisphere).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand Longitude**: Longitude is measured in degrees west of the Prime Meridian. A higher numerical value (e.g., 79° W) indicates a location further west than a lower value (e.g., 78° W).

2. **Locate the Counties**:
   - Cambria County, PA: This county is in south-central Pennsylvania. Its county seat is Ebensburg, located at approximately 78.725° W longitude. The city of Johnstown, within Cambria County, is at approximately 78.92° W longitude. The county's longitude range is roughly 78.6° W to 78.95° W.
   - Cattaraugus County, NY: This county is in western New York, bordering Pennsylvania. Its county seat is Little Valley, located at approximately 78.798° W longitude. The county's longitude range is roughly 78.4° W to 79.2° W, with its western parts extending to about 79.0° W or slightly higher.

3. **Compare Key Points**:
   - Compare county seats: Ebensburg (Cambria County) at 78.725° W and Little Valley (Cattaraugus County) at 78.798° W. Since 78.725° W < 78.798° W, Ebensburg is east of Little Valley.
   - Compare other significant points: Johnstown (in Cambria County) at 78.92° W is west of Little Valley (78.798° W) but east of the western parts of Cattaraugus County (up to 79.2° W).
   - Longitude ranges: Cambria County's range (78.6° W to 78.95° W) overlaps with Cattaraugus County's range (78.4° W to 79.2° W). Some parts of Cambria County are west of the eastern parts of Cattaraugus County, but the western parts of Cattaraugus County extend further west (e.g., up to 79.2° W vs. Cambria's maximum of 78.95° W).

4. **Assess Overall Position**:
   - The counties are not adjacent; Cattaraugus County borders McKean County, PA, which has a longitude of about 78.44° W for its seat. Cambria County is further south and has a centroid longitude of approximately 78.7° W to 78.8° W, while Cattaraugus County's centroid is around 78.8° W.
   - Based on centroid and county seat comparisons, Cambria County is generally at a similar or slightly lower longitude, indicating it is not entirely or generally west of Cattaraugus County. In fact, parts of Cattaraugus County extend further west.

5. **Conclusion**: When determining if one county is "located west of" another, the general position (e.g., centroids or typical locations) is considered. Given that Cambria County's key points (e.g., Ebensburg) are east of Cattaraugus County's key points (e.g., Little Valley), and considering the overall longitude ranges, Cambria County is not located west of Cattaraugus County.

### Final Answer: No
