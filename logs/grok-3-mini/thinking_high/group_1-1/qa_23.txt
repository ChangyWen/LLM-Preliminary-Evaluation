*********************************** End of Inputs **************************************




*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Pine Flat Dam, CA located east of St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

To determine if one location is east of another, I need to know their geographical positions. Specifically, I need the longitude of both places because east-west direction is determined by longitude lines.

- Pine Flat Dam is in California (CA).

- St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church is in Nevada (NV).

I should recall or look up the approximate locations.

Since this is a reasoning exercise, I'll use general knowledge or logical deduction.

California is on the west coast of the US, and Nevada is east of California. Nevada shares a border with California on the east side.

Pine Flat Dam: I think it's in central California, probably in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Upon thinking, Pine Flat Dam is on the Kings River in Fresno County, California. Fresno is in central California.

St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church: I'm not entirely familiar with this, but the name suggests it might be in a mountainous area in Nevada. Nevada has many mountain ranges. I believe this church is located in Virginia City, Nevada. Virginia City is a historic town in western Nevada, known for its mining history.

Confirming that: Yes, St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church is indeed in Virginia City, Nevada.

Now, locations:

- Pine Flat Dam, CA: Fresno County, California. Fresno is approximately at 36.7° N latitude and 119.8° W longitude.

- St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV: Virginia City, Nevada. Virginia City is around 39.3° N latitude and 119.9° W longitude. Wait, is that accurate?

I need precise longitudes to compare east-west.

General knowledge:

- California is west of Nevada.

But specifically:

Fresno, CA is in central California. Longitude-wise, it's around 119° W.

Virginia City, NV is in western Nevada. I think it's close to the California border.

Actually, Reno, NV is nearby, and Reno is at about 119.8° W longitude, similar to Fresno.

Fresno, CA is at approximately 119.8° W.

Reno, NV is at about 119.8° W as well, but Reno is slightly east or west?

Thinking about the state borders.

California and Nevada share a border that runs north-south, so longitudes might be similar near the border.

The California-Nevada border is not exactly on a longitude line; it's a bit jagged, but generally, western Nevada is at longitudes around 119° W to 120° W.

Specifics:

- Pine Flat Dam is near Fresno, which is inland. Fresno is at about 36.737° N, 119.787° W.

- Virginia City, NV: It's east of Reno. Reno is at about 39.529° N, 119.814° W.

Virginia City is a bit southeast of Reno. Upon recall, Virginia City is at approximately 39.314° N, 119.650° W.

Comparing longitudes:

- Pine Flat Dam (Fresno area): ~119.787° W

- St. Mary’s Church (Virginia City): ~119.650° W

Longitude decreases as you go east. In the western hemisphere, longitude is measured west, so a smaller longitude number (less west) means further east.

Standard longitude: 120° W is west of 119° W.

- Higher longitude west means further west.

Longitude is measured from 0° at Greenwich, increasing east to 180° and west to 180°, but in the US, we use west longitudes.

So, 120° W is west of 119° W. That means a location with 120° W is further west than one with 119° W.

To be east, a location has a smaller absolute longitude value in the west (since it's decreasing as you go east).

For example:

- San Francisco is about 122° W

- Denver is about 105° W, which is east of San Francisco.

Smaller longitude number (less west) means east.

More precisely, in the western hemisphere, lower longitude degrees mean closer to the Prime Meridian or further east.

Longitude increases westward in the western hemisphere, so:

- 120° W is west of 119° W.

So, a location with longitude 119° W is east of a location with 120° W.

Now, comparing:

- Pine Flat Dam: approx. 119.787° W

- Virginia City: approx. 119.650° W

119.650° W vs. 119.787° W.

119.650 is less than 119.787? No, 119.650 is 119 degrees and 39 minutes, while 119.787 is 119 degrees and about 47.22 minutes (since 0.787 * 60 ≈ 47.22).

Better to compare decimal degrees directly.

119.650° W and 119.787° W.

Since both are west, the one with the smaller numerical value is further east.

119.650° W is less than 119.787° W, so 119.650° W is east of 119.787° W.

Longitude increases westward, so a smaller longitude value (e.g., 119.650° W) is east of a larger longitude value (e.g., 119.787° W).

Yes.

So, Virginia City at 119.650° W is east of Fresno at 119.787° W.

Difference: 119.787 - 119.650 = 0.137 degrees.

Since 1 degree of longitude is about 111 km at the equator, but less at higher latitudes, but roughly, 0.137 degrees is about 15 km (since 1 degree ≈ 111 km, but at 39° N, it's cos(39°) ≈ 0.777, so about 86 km per degree, so 0.137 * 86 ≈ 11.8 km).

So, Virginia City is about 12 km east of Fresno? That can't be right because Fresno and Virginia City are not that close.

I think I have the longitudes wrong.

Fresno is in California, Virginia City is in Nevada.

Fresno latitude is about 36.7° N, Virginia City is about 39.3° N, so they are not at the same latitude, but for east-west comparison, we only care about longitude.

But geographically, Fresno is in central California, and Virginia City is in western Nevada.

I think I misremembered the longitude of Virginia City.

Let me think again.

Reno, NV is at about 119.8° W, and it's right on the border.

Fresno is also around 119.8° W, but Fresno is south, while Reno is north.

The California-Nevada border: Reno is very close to the border, but actually, Reno is in Nevada, so east of California.

Let's get accurate longitudes.

Upon second thought, I should recall that the Sierra Nevada range runs north-south, and the border is along the eastern side.

Fresno, CA is west of the Sierra Nevada, while Virginia City, NV is east of the Sierra Nevada.

Virginia City is in the Virginia Range, which is in Nevada, east of the Sierra.

So, typically, places in western Nevada are east of central California.

But let's confirm longitudes.

Standard knowledge:

- Los Angeles is at 118° W

- San Francisco is at 122° W

Fresno is between, around 119.8° W.

Now, Reno, NV: Reno is at approximately 119.8° W longitude, but since it's in Nevada, and the border is nearby.

Actually, the California-Nevada border near Lake Tahoe is around 120° W or so.

Lake Tahoe is straddled, but Reno is east of the Sierra.

Upon checking my memory, Reno is at 39.5294° N, 119.8137° W.

Virginia City is southeast of Reno, at about 39.314° N, 119.650° W. 119.650° W is less west, so east.

Fresno is at 36.7373° N, 119.7869° W.

So, longitude of Fresno: 119.7869° W

Longitude of Virginia City: let's confirm. Upon thinking, Virginia City, NV is at approximately 119.65° W.

Yes, according to standard sources, Virginia City, NV longitude is about -119.65° (which is 119.65° W).

Fresno, CA is -119.79° W approximately.

So, -119.65° W vs. -119.79° W.

In numerical terms, -119.65 is greater than -119.79 because -119.65 > -119.79.

But in terms of direction, since longitude is negative west, a larger number (less negative) means east.

Longitude in decimal degrees: west longitudes are negative in some systems, but typically we think of the magnitude.

Better to think in positive west degrees.

Fresno: 119.79° W

Virginia City: 119.65° W

119.65° W is less than 119.79° W in numerical value, but since it's west longitude, 119.65° W is closer to 0°, so it's east of 119.79° W.

Yes: a smaller degree in west longitude means further east.

For example, 100° W is east of 110° W.

So, 119.65° W is east of 119.79° W.

Therefore, Virginia City (119.65° W) is east of Fresno (119.79° W).

But the question is about Pine Flat Dam and the church.

Pine Flat Dam is near Fresno, actually on the Kings River, which is east of Fresno city, but still in the same area.

Pine Flat Dam is located at approximately 36.85° N, 119.35° W? No.

Fresno is at 119.79° W, but Pine Flat Dam is further east, in the foothills.

Upon recall, Pine Flat Dam is on the Kings River, and its coordinates are about 36.94° N, 119.32° W? I think it's around there.

Actually, looking it up in my mind: Pine Flat Dam is at 36.8367° N, 119.3244° W? That might be incorrect.

Fresno city is at 119.79° W, but the dam is east of that.

Kings Canyon National Park is east of Fresno, so longitudes should be smaller (east).

Longitude decreases as you go east.

Fresno city center is about 119.79° W, but going east towards the mountains, longitude decreases.

For example, Yosemite National Park is around 119.5° W to 120° W, but specifically.

Pine Flat Dam is in Fresno County, and I believe its longitude is around 119.3° W or so.

Upon better recall, Pine Flat Dam is at approximately 36.85° N, 119.33° W.

Yes, according to memory, it's about 119.33° W.

Now, St. Mary’s Church in Virginia City, NV: Virginia City is at about 119.65° W.

So, Pine Flat Dam: 119.33° W

Virginia City: 119.65° W

Now, compare 119.33° W and 119.65° W.

119.33° W is less than 119.65° W numerically, so 119.33° W is east of 119.65° W? No.

Smaller longitude number means east.

119.33° W is smaller than 119.65° W, so 119.33° W is further east than 119.65° W.

Longitude: 120° W is west, 119° W is east of that.

So, 119.33° W is east of 119.65° W because 119.33 < 119.65, so it's closer to 0°.

For example, New York is at 74° W, Los Angeles at 118° W, so LA is west of NY.

Higher number means further west.

So, 119.65° W is further west than 119.33° W.

Therefore, 119.33° W (Pine Flat Dam) is east of 119.65° W (Virginia City).

That would mean Pine Flat Dam is east of Virginia City, but that can't be right geographically.

I think I have the longitudes mixed up.

Let me think: California is west, Nevada is east.

Fresno is in California, Virginia City in Nevada.

So, Fresno should have higher longitude west than Virginia City? No.

Western Nevada should have similar or slightly higher longitude than eastern California.

Let's get accurate.

Actually, I think I have it backward.

Standard longitudes:

- San Francisco: 122.4° W

- Los Angeles: 118.2° W

Fresno is central, so around 119.8° W.

Now, the California-Nevada border: for example, near Lake Tahoe, which is at about 120° W.

Lake Tahoe is mostly in California, but straddles.

Reno, NV is east of the Sierra, so its longitude is less, meaning east.

Reno is at 119.81° W longitude.

Fresno is at 119.78° W, very close.

But Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno city.

Fresno city is at 119.78° W, but Pine Flat Dam is on the Kings River, which flows from the Sierra, so it's at a longitude of about 119.3° W? Let's think.

Upon correct recall, Pine Flat Dam is located at 36.8367° N latitude and 119.3244° W longitude. 119.3244° W.

119.3244° W is 119.3244 degrees west.

Virginia City, NV: 39.3142° N, 119.6498° W.

So, Pine Flat Dam: 119.3244° W

Virginia City: 119.6498° W

Now, 119.3244 vs 119.6498.

119.3244 is less than 119.6498, so 119.3244° W is east of 119.6498° W? No.

Numerical value: 119.3244 < 119.6498, but in longitude, smaller number means closer to the Prime Meridian, so east.

For west longitudes, a smaller degree means less west, so more east.

For example, 120° W is west of 119° W.

So, 119.3244° W is east of 119.6498° W because 119.3244 < 119.6498.

But that would imply Pine Flat Dam is east of Virginia City, which is incorrect because Pine Flat Dam is in California, Virginia City in Nevada.

I think I have the longitude of Pine Flat Dam wrong.

Let me double-check.

Upon thinking, if Fresno city is at 119.78° W, and Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno, towards the mountains, longitude should decrease as you go east.

Yes, so if Fresno is at 119.78° W, and you go east, longitude decreases, e.g., to 119.5° W or less.

Virginia City is in Nevada, which is east of California, so its longitude should be smaller.

Reno is at 119.81° W, which is very close to Fresno's 119.78° W, but Reno is slightly west or east?

119.81° W for Reno, 119.78° W for Fresno.

119.78 < 119.81, so Fresno at 119.78° W is east of Reno at 119.81° W? That can't be.

I think I have the values wrong.

Standard knowledge: Longitudes increase westward.

So, a location with higher longitude degree is further west.

Fresno, CA is at approximately 119.772° W.

Reno, NV is at 119.813° W.

119.813 > 119.772, so Reno is at higher longitude, so further west than Fresno.

But geographically, Reno is north of Fresno, and Nevada is east of California, but the Sierra Nevada mountain range runs between them.

Fresno is in the San Joaquin Valley, west of the Sierra Nevada.

Reno is in Nevada, east of the Sierra Nevada.

So, to go from Fresno to Reno, you go north and east, but longitudes: Fresno is at about 119.8° W, Reno is at about 119.8° W as well, but let's get accurate numbers.

Upon correct recall:

- Fresno, CA: longitude approximately -119.772° (119.772° W)

- Reno, NV: longitude approximately -119.813° (119.813° W)

So, 119.813° W > 119.772° W, so Reno is at a higher longitude number, so it is further west than Fresno.

But that doesn't make sense because Reno is in Nevada, which is east of California.

The Sierra Nevada range: the western slope is in California, eastern slope in Nevada.

Fresno is west of the Sierra, so at lower longitude? No.

Longitude lines are north-south, so for the same latitude, but Fresno and Reno are at different latitudes.

But for east-west, longitude determines it.

Actually, the California-Nevada border near Reno is not straight, but Reno is located at a longitude similar to parts of California.

In fact, Reno is at 119.813° W, and the city of Carson City, NV is nearby.

Virginia City is east of Reno.

Virginia City, NV is at approximately 119.65° W.

Yes, Virginia City is at 39.314° N, 119.650° W.

Fresno is at 36.737° N, 119.787° W.

For Pine Flat Dam: it is located at 36.8367° N, 119.3244° W.

119.3244° W for Pine Flat Dam.

Virginia City at 119.650° W.

So, 119.3244° W vs 119.650° W.

119.3244 < 119.650, so Pine Flat Dam has a smaller longitude number, so it is east of Virginia City.

But that can't be right because Pine Flat Dam is in California, Virginia City in Nevada.

Let's confirm the longitude of Pine Flat Dam.

Upon second thought, I think I have it wrong.

If Fresno city is at 119.787° W, and Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno, in the foothills, longitude should be smaller, e  g. 119.3° W or so.

Now, the California-Nevada border in that latitude: at 37° N, the border is around 119.5° W or something.

Actually, the easternmost part of California is at about 114° W, but for central California, the Sierra crest is around 118-119° W for southern part.

Let's think of Yosemite: Yosemite Valley is at about 119.5° W.

Yosemite is in California, and Nevada is east of that.

For example, Mono Lake is in California at about 119.0° W, and the border is near there.

Virginia City is at 119.65° W, which is west of some parts.

Perhaps Pine Flat Dam is at 119.32° W, which is east of Virginia City's 119.65° W.

119.32 < 119.65, so 119.32° W is east of 119.65° W.

Numerically smaller longitude means east.

So, 119.32° W is east of 119.65° W.

But geographically, Pine Flat Dam is in Fresno County, CA, and Virginia City is in Storey County, NV.

Fresno County is in central California, while Virginia City is in western Nevada.

The longitude of the California-Nevada border varies.

At the latitude of Fresno (37° N), the border is further east.

At 37° N, the California-N  V border is around 114° W for the southern part, but that's not right.

The California-Nevada border is mostly straight north-south at approximately 114.5° W for the southern part, but that's for the eastern border.

California's eastern border with Nevada is not straight; it's the Sierra Nevada and then a straight line.

Actually, the western border of Nevada with California is along the 120th meridian for part of it, but not all.

From north to south, the border starts at the Oregon border and goes south.

Near Lake Tahoe, the border is around 120° W.

At 39° N, the border is around 120° W for Lake Tahoe area.

Reno is at 39.5° N, 119.8° W, so it's east of the border.

The California-Nevada border at 39° N is at about 120° W for the northern part, but Reno is at 119.8° W, so Reno is east of the border.

Longitude 120° W is the border in some parts.

For example, Lake Tahoe is at 120° W, and Reno is east of that, at 119.8° W, so 119.8° W is less than 120° W, so east.

Yes.

Now for Pine Flat Dam at 36.8° N.

At 37° N, the California-Nevada border is further east.

The border follows the 120th meridian from the Oregon border down to 42° N or something, but actually, from the Oregon border, it's the 120th meridian until the Colorado River, but no.

Upon correct knowledge, the California-Nevada border is the 120th meridian from the Oregon border down to the 39th parallel, then it goes southeast along the Colorado River.

From 42° N to 39° N, the border is the 120th meridian.

At 39° N, it turns southeast.

Reno is at 39.5° N, so near the border.

Reno is at 119.8° W, and the 120th meridian is 120° W, so 119.8° W is east of 120° W.

120° W is west of 119.8° W.

Longitude 120° W is west of 119.8° W.

The 120th meridian is at 120° W, and Reno at 119.8° W is at a smaller longitude, so east of 120° W.

Yes, so the border at that latitude is 120° W, so Reno at 119.8° W is in Nevada, east of the border.

Now for Pine Flat Dam at 36.8° N.

At 37° N, the California-Nevada border is not on the 120th meridian; after 39° N, it goes southeast, but at 37° N, the border is further east.

At 37° N, the border is around 114.5° W or something, but that's for the eastern part.

California's eastern border with Nevada is the straight line from the intersection at 39° N, 120° W, then it goes south to the Colorado River.

From 39° N to the Colorado River, the border is a straight line at approximately 114-115° W for the southern part.

At 37° N, the longitude of the California-Nevada border.

The border from 39° N south is a straight line to a point on the Colorado River.

From 39° N, 120° W, it goes to 35° N, 114.5° W or something.

The endpoint is at the Colorado River.

At 37° N, let's calculate.

The border line from (39° N, 120° W) to (35° N, 114.04° W) or something.

Roughly, from 39N 120W to 35N 114W.

Change in latitude: 4 degrees south, change in longitude: 6 degrees east (from 120W to 114W, so longitude decreases by 6 degrees).

At latitude 37° N, from 39° N, delta lat = 2 degrees south.

Total delta lat 4 degrees for delta long 6 degrees, so slope is -1.5 degrees long per degree lat (since longitude decreases as latitude decreases in this case).

From 39N to 35N, delta lat = -4 degrees (south), delta long = -6 degrees (east, since from 120W to 114W, long decreases).

So, per degree latitude south, longitude decreases by 1.5 degrees.

At 37° N, from 39° N, delta lat = -2 degrees, so delta long = -3 degrees.

So longitude of border at 37° N is 120° W + delta long = 120 - 3 = 117° W? Wait, no.

At 39° N, long = 120° W.

Delta long = (delta lat / total delta lat) * total delta long.

Total delta lat from 39 to 35 is -4 degrees, total delta long = -6 degrees (from 120 to 114).

So at lat L, long = 120 + ( (L - 39) / (35 - 39) ) * (114 - 120) 

L - 39 is negative, 35 - 39 = -4, 114 - 120 = -6.

So long = 120 + [ (L - 39) / (-4) ] * (-6) = 120 + [ -(L - 39)/4 ] * 6 = 120 - (6/4) * (L - 39) * (-1) let's simplify.

[ (L - 39) / (-4) ] * (-6) = [ (L - 39) / 4 ] * 6  (since negative times negative)

[ (L - 39) / (-4) ] * (-6) = [ - (L - 39) / 4 ] * (-6) = [ (L - 39) / 4 ] * 6

Yes, so long = 120 + [6/4 * (L - 39)] = 120 + (3/2) * (L - 39)

L is latitude.

At L = 39, long = 120 + (3/2)*(0) = 120

At L = 35, long = 120 + (3/2)*(-4) = 120 + (3/2)*(-4) = 120 - 6 = 114, yes.

At L = 37° N, long = 120 + (3/2)*(37 - 39) = 120 + (3/2)*(-2) = 120 + (-3) = 117° W.

So at 37° N, the California-Nevada border is at 117° W.

Pine Flat Dam is at 36.8° N, approximately, and its longitude is 119.32° W.

119.32° W is west of 117° W, so it's in California, which is correct.

Virginia City is at 39.3° N, 119.65° W.

At 39.3° N, the border is near 120° W, but Virginia City at 119.65° W is east of 120° W, so in Nevada.

To compare east-west between Pine Flat Dam at 119.32° W and Virginia  City at 119.65° W.

Since 119.32° W and 119.65° W, 119.32 < 119.65, so Pine Flat Dam has smaller longitude number, so it is east of Virginia City.

But is that possible? Let's see the actual positions.

Pine  Flat Dam is at about 119.32° W, Virginia City at 119.65° W.

119.32° W is less west, so more east.

For example, 119.32° W is closer to 119° W, while 119.65° W is closer to 120° W.

So yes, 119.32° W is east of 119.65° W.

But geographically, Pine Flat Dam is in central California, Virginia City is in western Nevada, but at different latitudes.

Pine Flat Dam is at 36.8° N, Virginia City at 39.3° N, so Pine Flat Dam is south and east in terms of longitude.

To determine if Pine Flat Dam is east of Virginia City, we look at longitude only for east-west direction, ignoring latitude.

Since longitude of Pine Flat Dam is 119.32° W and Virginia City is 119.65° W, and 119.32 < 119.65, so Pine Flat Dam is at a smaller longitude west, so it is east of Virginia City.

But that seems counterintuitive because Nevada is generally east of California, but in this case, because of the shape, at different latitudes, the longitudes overlap.

Specifically, at lower latitudes, California's eastern border is further west.

At 37° N, border is at 117° W, so Pine Flat Dam at 119.32° W is west of that, in California.

Virginia City at 39.3° N is at 119.65° W, while at 39.3° N, the border is near 120° W, so Virginia City at 119.65° W is east.

Now, comparing the two points: Pine Flat Dam at 119.32° W, Virginia City at 119.65° W, so indeed, Pine Flat Dam has a smaller longitude value, so it is east of Virginia City in terms of longitude.

But to confirm with actual geography: from Virginia City, NV to Pine Flat Dam, CA, you would go west and south.

Since longitude of Virginia City is 119.65° W, Pine Flat Dam 119.32° W, so to go from Virginia City to Pine Flat Dam, you decrease longitude, which is going east, but that can't be.

Decreasing longitude means going east.

From 119.65° W to 119.32° W, you are going to a smaller west longitude, so east.

But Pine Flat Dam is in California, so how can it be east of a point in Nevada?

I think I have the longitude of Pine Flat Dam wrong.

Let me double-check online or standard knowledge.

Upon thinking, I might have misremembered.

Fresno city is at 119.78° W, and Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno, so longitude should be smaller, e.g. 119.3° W.

Now, the distance: from Fresno to the Sierra, longitude decreases.

Virginia City is at 119.65° W, which is very close to Fresno's longitude.

Fresno at 119.78° W, Virginia City at 119.65° W, so Virginia City is at smaller longitude, so east of Fresno.

119.65 < 119.78, so Virginia City is east of Fresno.

Pine  Flat Dam is east of Fresno, at 119.32° W, which is even smaller, so further east.

At 36.8° N, the Nevada border is at 117° W, so 119.32° W is still in California, but 119.32° W at 36.8° N is west of the border at 117° W.

Longitude 119.32° W is greater than 117° W in numerical value? 119.32 > 117, so 119.32° W is west of 117° W.

Yes.

Now, Virginia City at 119.65° W at 39.3° N.

To compare east-west, only longitude matters.

So, longitude of Pine Flat Dam: 119.32° W

Longitude of Virginia City: 119.65° W

Since 119.32 < 119.65, Pine  Flat Dam is at a smaller west longitude, so it is located east of Virginia City.

But that seems odd because Virginia City is in Nevada, Pine Flat Dam in California.

However, because of the latitude difference, at higher latitudes, the same longitude is further west in terms of the border.

For example, at 39.3° N, the border is at 120° W, so Virginia City at 119.65° W is 0.35 degrees east of the border.

At 36.8° N, the border is at 117° W, so Pine Flat Dam at 119.32° W is 2.32 degrees west of the border (since 119.32 - 117 = 2.32 degrees west).

So, in absolute terms, Pine Flat Dam is further west from its border than Virginia City is from its border, but in terms of longitude value, Pine Flat Dam has smaller longitude, so it is east.

Yes, so on a map, if you draw a line of constant latitude, at 36.8° N, 119.32° W is a point, and at 39.3° N, 119.65° W is another point, and since longitude lines are parallel, the point with smaller longitude is east.

So, Pine Flat Dam is east of Virginia City in terms of longitude.

To confirm with actual distance, the difference in longitude is 119.65 - 119.32 = 0.33 degrees.

At average latitude, say 38° N, the distance per degree longitude is cos(38°) * 111 km ≈ 0.788 * 111 ≈ 87.5 km per degree, so 0.33 degrees ≈ 28.9 km.

So they are about 29 km apart in longitude, with Pine Flat Dam east.

But they are at different latitudes, so the straight-line distance is larger, but for east-west direction, Pine Flat Dam is east of Virginia City.

Is that correct? Virginia City is at 39.3° N, Pine Flat Dam at 36.8° N, so south as well.

But the question is only about east-west, not the direction including latitude.

The question is "located east of", which typically means in the eastern direction, so based on longitude.

In geographical terms, "east of" usually refers to longitude, assuming the same latitude or in general direction.

In this case, since Pine Flat Dam has a smaller longitude west value, it is east of Virginia City.

But let's confirm the exact locations.

I think I have a mistake.

Let's look up standard coordinates.

Upon accurate recall or standard knowledge:

Pine Flat Dam, CA: latitude 36.8367° N, longitude 119.3244° W

St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV: in Virginia City, NV, which is at approximately 39.3142° N, 119.6498° W

Yes.

So longitude: Pine Flat Dam: 119.3244° W

Virginia City: 119.6498° W

Difference: 119.6498 - 119.3244 = 0.3254 degrees.

Since 119.3244 < 119.6498, Pine Flat Dam is at a smaller longitude value, so it is located at a position with less west longitude, meaning it is east of Virginia City.

However, to be precise, since they are at different latitudes, the actual direction from Virginia City to Pine Flat Dam is southeast, because longitude decreases (east) and latitude decreases (south).

So, yes, it is east of Virginia City in the east-west sense.

Therefore, Pine Flat Dam is located east of St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church.

The church is in NV, dam in CA, but based on longitude, yes.

So the answer should be Yes.

But intuitively, I thought Nevada is east, but in this specific case, due to the location, the dam is further east in longitude.

Yes.

To confirm with a map: Virginia City is near Reno, which is at similar longitude to Fresno, but Pine Flat Dam is east of Fresno, so even further east.

Fresno is at 119.78° W, Pine Flat Dam at 119.32° W, so east, Virginia City at 119.65° W, which is between Fresno and Pine Flat in longitude.

Fresno 119.78, Virginia City 119.65, Pine Flat 119.32, so order from west to east: Fresno (119.78W), Virginia City (119.65W), Pine Flat Dam (119.32W).

119.78 > 119.65 > 119.32, so west to east: Fresno, then Virginia City, then Pine Flat Dam.

Higher number is west, so Fresno at 119.78W is west of Virginia City at 119.65W, which is west of Pine Flat Dam at 119.32W.

So yes, Pine Flat Dam is east of Virginia City.

And Virginia City is where the church is.

So, Pine Flat Dam is located east of the church.

Therefore, the answer is Yes.

But the church is in NV, dam in CA, but longitude-wise, yes.

So, final answer should be Yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if Pine Flat Dam in California is located east of St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church in Nevada, I will compare their geographical positions based on longitude, as east-west direction is determined by longitude lines. Longitude values are measured in degrees west (W) for locations in the Western Hemisphere, and a smaller longitude value indicates a position further east.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the locations and their approximate coordinates:**
   - Pine Flat Dam is located in Fresno County, California, at approximately 36.8367° N latitude and 119.3244° W longitude.
   - St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church is in Virginia City, Nevada, at approximately 39.3142° N latitude and 119.6498° W longitude.

2. **Compare the longitudes:**
   - Pine Flat Dam longitude: 119.3244° W
   - St. Mary’s Church longitude: 119.6498° W
   - In the Western Hemisphere, longitude increases as you move west and decreases as you move east. Therefore, a smaller longitude value indicates a more easterly position.
   - Numerically, 119.3244° W is less than 119.6498° W, meaning Pine Flat Dam is at a smaller (less west) longitude than St. Mary’s Church.

3. **Interpret the longitude difference:**
   - The difference in longitude is 119.6498° W - 119.3244° W = 0.3254 degrees.
   - At an average latitude of about 38° N (midpoint between the two locations), the distance per degree of longitude is approximately 87.5 km (calculated using the formula: distance ≈ cos(latitude) × 111 km per degree). Thus, the east-west distance is roughly 0.3254 × 87.5 km ≈ 28.5 km.
   - Since Pine Flat Dam has a smaller longitude value, it is located east of St. Mary’s Church in terms of longitude.

4. **Consider geographical context:**
   - Although Nevada is generally east of California, the specific longitudes of these locations show that Pine Flat Dam (in central California) is east of Virginia City (in western Nevada) due to the north-south variation in the California-Nevada border and the relative positions.
   - The actual direction from St. Mary’s Church to Pine Flat Dam is southeast, as the longitude difference indicates east, and the latitude difference (39.3142° N to 36.8367° N) indicates south.

5. **Conclusion based on the query:**
   - The question asks if Pine Flat Dam is located east of St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, which is determined by longitude. Based on the comparison, Pine Flat Dam is indeed east of the church.

### Final Answer: Yes
