*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Does the United States have a larger population than Canada?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the United States is a large country with many people, and Canada is also large but less populated. I should use reliable knowledge or facts.

From what I recall, the population of the United States is around 330 million people. I think the last census or estimate was about 331 million in 2020, and it might have grown a bit, but let's stick with approximately 330-340 million.

For Canada, I think it's around 38 million. I've heard that Canada has about 38-40 million people. Let me confirm my memory: yes, I believe the population of Canada is roughly 38 million as of recent years.

Now, comparing the two: 330-340 million vs. 38 million. Clearly, 330 million is much larger than 38 million.

To be precise, I should use the most accurate figures I can recall. Since I'm an AI, I have access to general knowledge up to my last training data. Assuming my knowledge is current, the US population is indeed larger.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall population figures:
   - United States: Approximately 331 million (as of 2020 census).
   - Canada: Approximately 38 million (as of recent estimates).

2. Compare the numbers:
   - 331 million > 38 million? Yes, obviously.

3. Consider if there's any chance this could be wrong:
   - Population can change, but as of my last knowledge, the US has a significantly larger population.
   - No major events that would have drastically changed this in a way that reverses the comparison.

4. Think about the ratio: The US population is about 8-9 times that of Canada, which is a well-known fact.

5. Final answer should be based on this comparison.

So, the answer is Yes.

The question asks for a step-by-step reasoning process and a final answer in Yes or No format. I need to present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Recall population figures**: Based on general knowledge and reliable estimates, the population of the United States is approximately 331 million people (as of the 2020 census, with minor growth since then). The population of Canada is approximately 38 million people (based on recent estimates, such as those from Statistics Canada around 2023).

2. **Compare the numbers**: 331 million (US) is significantly larger than 38 million (Canada). Specifically, the US population is about 8-9 times that of Canada.

3. **Consider reliability and potential changes**: Population figures can fluctuate due to factors like immigration, birth rates, or events, but as of the most recent available data, the US consistently has a much larger population than Canada. There are no known recent developments that would reverse this trend.

4. **Conclusion from comparison**: Since 331 million is greater than 38 million, the United States has a larger population than Canada.

### Final Answer: Yes
