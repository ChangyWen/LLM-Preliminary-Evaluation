*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the boiling point of water higher than the freezing point of water?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that water has specific temperatures for boiling and freezing. The freezing point is when water turns from liquid to solid, and the boiling point is when it turns from liquid to gas.

From standard knowledge, the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, and the boiling point is 100 degrees Celsius. This is under standard atmospheric pressure.

Now, the question is asking if the boiling point is higher than the freezing point. So, is 100°C higher than 0°C? Yes, obviously.

But I should make sure there are no tricks here. The question specifies "water," and it doesn't mention any special conditions like pressure or impurities. So, I can assume standard conditions.

Let me recall the definitions:

- Freezing point: the temperature at which a liquid becomes a solid. For water, it's 0°C.

- Boiling point: the temperature at which a liquid becomes a gas. For water, it's 100°C.

Comparing 100°C and 0°C, 100 is greater than 0, so yes.

In Kelvin, freezing point is 273 K and boiling point is 373 K. 373 K is higher than 273 K, so still yes.

The question is straightforward and doesn't specify any units, but since both points are compared, the scale doesn't matter as long as it's the same for both.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the freezing point of water: 0°C.

2. Identify the boiling point of water: 100°C.

3. Compare the two values: 100°C > 0°C.

4. Therefore, the boiling point is higher.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "Show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)." So, I need to present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the freezing point of water**: Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), the freezing point of water is 0°C. This is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a solid (ice).

2. **Identify the boiling point of water**: Under the same standard conditions (1 atm), the boiling point of water is 100°C. This is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a gas (steam).

3. **Compare the two temperatures**: The boiling point (100°C) is greater than the freezing point (0°C). This is true because 100 is numerically larger than 0 on the Celsius scale.

4. **Consider standard conditions**: The question does not specify any unusual conditions, such as changes in pressure or the presence of impurities, which could alter these points. Therefore, we assume standard conditions where the comparison holds.

5. **Verify with another temperature scale (optional for clarity)**: In Kelvin, the freezing point is 273 K and the boiling point is 373 K. Since 373 K > 273 K, the result is consistent.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, the boiling point of water is indeed higher than the freezing point.

### Final Answer: Yes
