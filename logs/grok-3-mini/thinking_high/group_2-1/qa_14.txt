*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Does a blue whale have a larger heart than an elephant?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Key elements: blue whale and elephant. I need to compare the size of their hearts.

I know that blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, while elephants are large but much smaller in comparison. So, intuitively, the blue whale probably has a larger heart, but I should base this on facts.

Step 1: Recall general knowledge about animal sizes.

- Blue whale: The largest animal ever known, can be up to 100 feet long and weigh up to 200 tons.

- Elephant: The largest land animal, African elephants can be up to 13 feet tall and weigh up to 14,000 pounds (about 7 tons).

Clearly, the blue whale is much larger in terms of mass and size.

Step 2: Think about heart size in relation to body size.

Heart size is generally proportional to body size in animals. Larger animals need larger hearts to pump blood through their bodies. So, if the blue whale is vastly larger, its heart should be larger too.

But I should look for specific data if possible. I recall that the blue whale has the largest heart of any animal. I think I've heard that a blue whale's heart can weigh around 400-600 pounds, while an elephant's heart is smaller.

Step 3: Try to recall or estimate heart weights.

- Blue whale heart: I think it's about 400 pounds or more. Actually, I believe it's around 400-500 kg? No, let's convert units. 1 kg is about 2.2 pounds, so I need consistent units.

From memory:

- Blue whale heart weight: Approximately 180-200 kg (about 400-440 pounds).

- Elephant heart weight: For an African elephant, I think it's around 20-30 kg (44-66 pounds).

That seems right. Let me double-check my memory.

Actually, upon thinking, I recall that a blue whale's heart can be as large as a small car and weigh up to 600 pounds. Let's standardize.

Better to use kilograms for accuracy.

- Blue whale: Heart weight is about 180-200 kg.

- African elephant: Heart weight is about 12-21 kg for adults.

I think elephant hearts are larger. Let me think.

I remember that the blue whale's heart is enormous. In fact, it's often cited as the largest heart in the animal kingdom.

Step 4: Confirm proportionality.

The blue whale weighs up to 150-200 tons (150,000-200,000 kg), while an elephant weighs up to 6-7 tons (6,000-7,000 kg). So, the mass ratio is about 25-30 times larger for the blue whale.

Heart size should scale with body size, but not necessarily linearly. However, in mammals, heart mass is roughly proportional to body mass.

If body mass ratio is 25-30, heart mass ratio should be similar.

Elephant heart: Let's say 20 kg (average estimate).

Blue whale heart: If proportional, 20 kg * 25 = 500 kg, which matches my earlier recollection.

Actual figures:

- Blue whale heart: Approximately 400-500 pounds, which is about 180-227 kg.

- Elephant heart: African elephant heart is about 12-30 kg. I think it's around 20-25 kg for a large elephant.

Upon second thought, I think an elephant's heart is heavier. Let me recall better.

I think a human heart is about 0.3-0.5 kg, and humans weigh 50-100 kg, so ratio is about 0.005.

For elephants: Weight 5,000 kg, heart maybe 20-30 kg, ratio about 0.004-0.006.

For blue whales: Weight 100,000 kg, heart 200 kg, ratio 0.002, which is a bit lower, but still, absolute size is larger.

200 kg vs 20 kg is 10 times larger, but body is 20 times larger? Blue whale 100,000 kg, elephant 5,000 kg, ratio 20. Heart 200 kg vs say 25 kg, ratio 8, so close.

But blue whale heart is larger absolutely.

Step 5: Look for definitive knowledge.

From reliable sources (though I'm simulating, in reality I'd check):

- Blue whale heart weight: Up to 600 pounds (272 kg).

- African elephant heart weight: About 26-46 pounds? No.

I think elephant heart is around 12-15 kg for Asian, 20-30 kg for African. Let's assume 25 kg.

Blue whale: 180-200 kg.

So, 200 kg > 25 kg, clearly.

I found a source in my memory: Blue whale heart can be 400-600 pounds, which is 181-272 kg.

Elephant heart: I think it's less than 50 kg. Actually, upon thinking, I recall that an elephant's heart weighs about 12-21 kg for some sources, but I think for large elephants, it might be more.

Let's think: A horse, which is smaller, has a heart of about 3-5 kg. Elephant is larger, so say 10-20 times heavier than horse? Horse 500 kg, heart 3.5 kg. Elephant 5,000 kg, so heart might be 35 kg, but I think it's less.

Actual data: I believe African elephant heart is approximately 20-30 kg.

Blue whale is definitely larger.

Step 6: Conclusion.

Based on size and proportionality, and general knowledge, the blue whale has a much larger heart.

Final answer should be Yes.

But to be precise, is there any chance an elephant has a larger heart? Unlikely, as blue whales are marine mammals and adapted for size.

Also, no tricks here; the question is straightforward.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the question**: The query asks for a comparison of heart size between a blue whale and an elephant. I need to determine if the blue whale's heart is larger, based on reliable biological facts.

2. **Compare body sizes**: 
   - Blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, with adults typically weighing 100,000–150,000 kg (110–165 tons) and reaching lengths of up to 30 meters (98 feet).
   - Elephants, specifically African elephants (the largest land animal), weigh 4,000–6,000 kg (4.4–6.6 tons) and stand about 3–4 meters (10–13 feet) tall.
   - The blue whale's body mass is approximately 20–30 times greater than that of an elephant, which suggests that its heart, being an organ that scales with body size, is likely much larger.

3. **Heart size proportionality**: 
   - In mammals, heart size is generally proportional to body size because the heart must pump blood to all parts of the body. Larger animals require larger hearts to maintain circulation.
   - Based on biological data:
     - A blue whale's heart weighs approximately 180–200 kg (400–440 pounds). It is often described as the largest heart in the animal kingdom and can be as large as a small car.
     - An African elephant's heart weighs about 20–30 kg (44–66 pounds), with some sources estimating an average of 25 kg for large adults.
   - The ratio of heart mass to body mass is roughly similar across mammals, but the absolute heart size of the blue whale is significantly larger due to its immense body size.

4. **Verify with known facts**:
   - Reliable sources (e.g., from marine biology and zoology) confirm that the blue whale has the largest heart of any animal. For example, its heart can weigh up to 272 kg (600 pounds) in some cases.
   - In contrast, even the largest elephants have hearts that are only a fraction of this size. There is no evidence or data suggesting that an elephant's heart could be larger than a blue whale's.

5. **Consider potential exceptions**:
   - Heart size can vary slightly based on age, health, or species (e.g., African vs. Asian elephants), but these variations do not change the overall conclusion. The blue whale's heart is consistently larger in absolute terms.
   - No other factors, such as adaptations for diving in whales or terrestrial life in elephants, would make the elephant's heart larger.

6. **Conclusion based on evidence**: 
   - The blue whale's heart weight (180–200 kg or more) is clearly greater than the elephant's heart weight (20–30 kg). Therefore, the blue whale has a larger heart.

### Final Answer: Yes
