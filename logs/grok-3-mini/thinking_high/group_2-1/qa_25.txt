*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon less than that on Earth?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Acceleration due to gravity is the rate at which an object accelerates towards the center of a planet when dropped. On Earth, it's about 9.8 m/s². I need to compare this to the Moon's gravity.

The acceleration due to gravity depends on the mass of the planet and its radius. The formula is g = G * M / R², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and R is its radius.

For Earth and the Moon, I need to compare g_moon and g_earth.

I know that the Moon has less mass than Earth. Earth's mass is about 5.97 × 10^24 kg, and the Moon's mass is about 7.35 × 10^22 kg. So, Moon's mass is much smaller.

Also, the radius of the Moon is smaller than Earth's. Earth's radius is about 6,371 km, and the Moon's radius is about 1,737 km. So, Moon's radius is roughly 1/4 of Earth's radius? Let me calculate: 6,371 / 1,737 ≈ 3.67, so about 1/3.67, or roughly 0.27 times Earth's radius.

Now, using the formula g = G M / R².

So, g_moon / g_earth = (G M_moon / R_moon²) / (G M_earth / R_earth²) = (M_moon / M_earth) * (R_earth² / R_moon²)

I need the ratio M_moon / M_earth and R_earth / R_moon.

M_moon / M_earth = 7.35 × 10^22 / 5.97 × 10^24 = ? Let's calculate: 7.35e22 / 5.97e24 = 7.35 / 5.97 × 10^(22-24) = 1.23 × 10^{-2} approximately (since 7.35 / 6 ≈ 1.225, and 5.97 is close to 6).

More accurately: 7.35 / 5.97 ≈ 1.2305, and 10^{-2}, so 0.012305.

Now, R_earth / R_moon = 6371 / 1737 ≈ ? 6371 ÷ 1737. Let's see, 1737 × 3 = 5211, 6371 - 5211 = 1160, so about 3.67 (since 1737 × 0.67 ≈ 1163, close). So R_earth / R_moon ≈ 3.67.

Now, (R_earth / R_moon)² ≈ (3.67)² ≈ 13.4689.

So, g_moon / g_earth = (M_moon / M_earth) * (R_earth² / R_moon²) = 0.012305 * 13.4689 ≈ ?

First, 0.012305 × 13.4689. Let's compute 0.0123 × 13.47 ≈ 0.0123 × 13 = 0.1599, 0.0123 × 0.47 ≈ 0.005781, total ≈ 0.165681.

More accurately, 0.012305 × 13.4689.

I know that the actual gravity on the Moon is about 1.62 m/s², and on Earth it's 9.8 m/s², so g_moon / g_earth ≈ 1.62 / 9.8 ≈ 0.1653, which matches my calculation.

So, g_moon / g_earth ≈ 0.165, which is less than 1.

Therefore, g_moon < g_earth.

So, the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is less than that on Earth.

I could also think about it qualitatively. The Moon has less mass, which would decrease gravity, but smaller radius, which would increase gravity because you're closer to the center. However, the mass effect dominates because the mass ratio is about 1/81 (since 1 / 0.0123 ≈ 81.3), and radius ratio is about 1/3.67, so radius squared is about 1/13.5, so g ratio is (1/81) / (1/13.5) wait no.

g_moon / g_earth = (M_moon / M_earth) * (R_earth / R_moon)^2

M_moon / M_earth ≈ 1/81, R_earth / R_moon ≈ 3.67, (3.67)^2 ≈ 13.47, so 1/81 * 13.47 ≈ 13.47 / 81 ≈ 0.166, same as before.

Since 81 is larger than the square of the radius ratio (13.47), the mass decrease outweighs the radius decrease, so gravity is less.

I recall that astronauts can jump higher on the Moon, which indicates lower gravity.

So, all points to yes, it is less.

The question is: "Is the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon less than that on Earth?" And I need to say Yes or No.

From this, it's yes.

But just to be thorough, is there any trick? Like, is gravity the same or something? No, definitely not.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "less than", and it is less, so Yes.

Now, for the boxed answer, it should be Yes or No, as per instruction.

So, I'm done.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine if the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is less than that on Earth, we need to compare the two values using the formula for gravitational acceleration, \( g = \frac{G M}{R^2} \), where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the mass of the celestial body, and \( R \) is its radius.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the known values:**
   - Acceleration due to gravity on Earth (\( g_{\text{earth}} \)) is approximately 9.8 m/s².
   - Mass of Earth (\( M_{\text{earth}} \)) is approximately \( 5.97 \times 10^{24} \) kg.
   - Radius of Earth (\( R_{\text{earth}} \)) is approximately 6,371 km.
   - Mass of the Moon (\( M_{\text{moon}} \)) is approximately \( 7.35 \times 10^{22} \) kg.
   - Radius of the Moon (\( R_{\text{moon}} \)) is approximately 1,737 km.
   - Acceleration due to gravity on the Moon (\( g_{\text{moon}} \)) is approximately 1.62 m/s² (this can be calculated or recalled from standard values).

2. **Compare the masses and radii:**
   - The mass ratio \( \frac{M_{\text{moon}}}{M_{\text{earth}}} = \frac{7.35 \times 10^{22}}{5.97 \times 10^{24}} \approx 0.0123 \) (or about 1/81).
   - The radius ratio \( \frac{R_{\text{earth}}}{R_{\text{moon}}} = \frac{6371}{1737} \approx 3.67 \).
   - Squaring the radius ratio gives \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{earth}}}{R_{\text{moon}}} \right)^2 \approx (3.67)^2 \approx 13.47 \).

3. **Use the gravity ratio formula:**
   - The ratio of accelerations is given by \( \frac{g_{\text{moon}}}{g_{\text{earth}}} = \frac{M_{\text{moon}}}{M_{\text{earth}}} \times \left( \frac{R_{\text{earth}}}{R_{\text{moon}}} \right)^2 \).
   - Substituting the values: \( \frac{g_{\text{moon}}}{g_{\text{earth}}} \approx 0.0123 \times 13.47 \approx 0.166 \).
   - This ratio (approximately 0.166) is less than 1, indicating that \( g_{\text{moon}} < g_{\text{earth}} \).

4. **Verify with direct values:**
   - \( g_{\text{moon}} \approx 1.62 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) and \( g_{\text{earth}} \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
   - Direct comparison: \( 1.62 < 9.8 \), confirming that the Moon's gravity is less.

5. **Qualitative reasoning:**
   - The Moon has a much smaller mass than Earth, which decreases gravity.
   - Although the Moon's smaller radius increases gravity slightly (due to being closer to the center), the effect of the mass difference dominates, resulting in lower gravity on the Moon.
   - This is consistent with observations, such as astronauts being able to jump higher on the Moon.

### Final Answer:
\boxed{\text{Yes}}
