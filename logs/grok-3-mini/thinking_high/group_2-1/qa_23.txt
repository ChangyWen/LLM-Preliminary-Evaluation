*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the pH of lemon juice lower than that of water?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. It's based on the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution. The scale goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Lower pH means more acidic, higher pH means more basic.

Water is neutral, so its pH is 7. Pure water has a pH of 7 at 25°C.

Lemon juice is acidic because lemons contain citric acid. So, it should have a low pH.

I recall that lemon juice typically has a pH around 2 to 3. Citric acid is a weak acid, but it's still acidic.

Comparing to water: water pH is 7, lemon juice pH is about 2-3. So, 2-3 is less than 7, which means it's lower.

The question says "water," but it doesn't specify if it's pure water or tap water. In scientific contexts, "water" often means pure water with pH 7. Tap water might have a slightly different pH due to dissolved minerals, but it's usually close to neutral, say 6.5 to 8.5. But I think for this question, we should assume pure water, as it's a general comparison.

Even if it's tap water, the lowest pH for tap water is around 6.5, which is still higher than lemon juice's pH of 2-3.

So, lemon juice pH < water pH in both cases.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Define pH: pH = -log[H+], lower pH means higher acidity.

2. pH of pure water: 7 (neutral).

3. pH of lemon juice: acidic due to citric acid, typically 2-3.

4. Comparison: 2-3 < 7, so yes, lower.

Is there any scenario where lemon juice might not be acidic? No, lemons are always acidic.

What about the concentration? Fresh lemon juice is acidic.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question asks for "Yes or No," so I need to box that.

Reasoning process:

- pH scale: acidic < 7, neutral = 7, basic > 7.

- Lemon juice is acidic, so pH < 7.

- Water is neutral, pH = 7.

- Therefore, pH of lemon juice < pH of water.

Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand pH**: pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution, based on the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. A pH lower than 7 indicates acidity, while a pH higher than 7 indicates basicity.

2. **pH of water**: Pure water is neutral and has a pH of 7 at 25°C. If the question refers to tap water, its pH can vary slightly (typically between 6.5 and 8.5) due to dissolved minerals or impurities, but it is generally close to neutral. For this comparison, we assume "water" refers to pure water with a pH of 7, as this is the standard reference in such contexts.

3. **pH of lemon juice**: Lemon juice is acidic due to the presence of citric acid, a weak organic acid. The typical pH of lemon juice ranges from 2 to 3, depending on factors like ripeness and concentration.

4. **Comparison**: 
   - The pH of lemon juice (2-3) is less than the pH of pure water (7).
   - Even if we consider tap water with a pH as low as 6.5, it is still higher than the pH of lemon juice (2-3).
   - Therefore, in all reasonable scenarios, the pH of lemon juice is lower than that of water.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the definitions and typical values, the pH of lemon juice is indeed lower than that of water.

### Final Answer: Yes
