*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Was the discovery of penicillin before the discovery of DNA structure?" I need to answer with a simple Yes or No, but I must show my step-by-step reasoning process.

Key events:

- Discovery of penicillin.

- Discovery of DNA structure.

I need to recall when these were discovered.

Starting with penicillin:

- Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928. He noticed that a mold (Penicillium) was killing bacteria in a petri dish.

Now, DNA structure:

- The structure of DNA was discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. They proposed the double helix model.

Confirming the dates:

- Penicillin: 1928.

- DNA structure: 1953.

Is 1928 before 1953? Yes, obviously.

But I should make sure there are no tricks here. Was penicillin discovered earlier or later? No, 1928 is well-established.

What about DNA? Was the structure discovered earlier? No, Watson and Crick's work in 1953 is the key event for the double helix structure. Earlier work by others like Rosalind Franklin, Erwin Chargaff, etc., contributed, but the discovery is attributed to 1953.

Also, penicillin was not widely used until later, but the discovery itself was in 1928.

So, timeline:

- 1928: Discovery of penicillin.

- 1953: Discovery of DNA structure.

Therefore, yes, penicillin was discovered before DNA structure.

Final answer should be Yes.

But the question says "discovery of DNA structure," not just discovery of DNA. DNA was discovered earlier by Friedrich Miescher in 1869, but that's not the structure. The structure specifically refers to the double helix, which is 1953.

So, no ambiguity there.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall the discovery date of penicillin: 1928 by Alexander Fleming.

2. Recall the discovery date of DNA structure: 1953 by Watson and Crick.

3. Compare the dates: 1928 < 1953, so penicillin discovery is earlier.

4. Therefore, the answer is Yes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Identify the key events and their associated dates:**
   - The discovery of penicillin is attributed to Alexander Fleming, who observed its antibacterial properties in 1928.
   - The discovery of the DNA structure (specifically the double helix model) is credited to James Watson and Francis Crick, based on their work published in 1953. (Note: While DNA itself was discovered earlier by Friedrich Miescher in 1869, the question specifically asks about the "DNA structure," which refers to the 1953 double helix model.)

2. **Compare the dates:**
   - Penicillin discovery: 1928.
   - DNA structure discovery: 1953.
   - Since 1928 is earlier than 1953, the discovery of penicillin occurred before the discovery of DNA structure.

3. **Consider potential ambiguities:**
   - The question specifies "discovery of DNA structure," so I am focusing on the 1953 event, not earlier discoveries of DNA's existence.
   - Penicillin's discovery date is well-documented as 1928, with no significant debate about when it was first observed.
   - There are no known revisions to these historical timelines that would change the order.

4. **Draw a conclusion:**
   - Based on the timeline, penicillin was indeed discovered before the DNA structure.

### Final Answer:
Yes
