*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the speed of light faster than the speed of sound?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the speed of light is a fundamental constant in physics, denoted by 'c', and it's approximately 300,000 kilometers per second in a vacuum. That's 3 x 10^8 m/s.

The speed of sound varies depending on the medium it's traveling through. In air at room temperature, it's about 343 meters per second. In other materials like water or steel, it's faster, but still much slower than light.

Comparing the two: speed of light is 300,000,000 m/s, and speed of sound is around 343 m/s. Clearly, 300,000,000 is much larger than 343.

To be precise, let's do a rough calculation. The ratio of speed of light to speed of sound is about 300,000,000 / 343 ≈ 874,000. So, light is about 874,000 times faster than sound in air.

This is a well-established fact in science. For example, we see lightning before we hear thunder because light travels faster than sound.

The question doesn't specify any conditions, so I should assume standard conditions, like in air for sound and in vacuum for light, as those are the typical references.

Even in other media, light slows down, but sound also changes. For instance, in water, speed of sound is about 1,480 m/s, and speed of light in water is about 225,000,000 m/s (since refractive index is about 1.33, so c/1.33). Still, 225,000,000 > 1,480, so light is faster.

In no medium is sound faster than light, as far as I know. Sound requires a medium to travel, while light can travel in vacuum, but even when light slows down in a medium, it's still faster than sound in that same medium.

So, universally, the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound.

My reasoning steps:

1. Recall the approximate values: speed of light ≈ 3 x 10^8 m/s, speed of sound in air ≈ 343 m/s.

2. Compare the values: 3 x 10^8 m/s > 343 m/s.

3. Consider that this holds in various media; light is always faster.

4. Conclude that yes, the speed of light is faster than the speed of sound.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question asks for a step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer in Yes or No. So, I need to present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the speeds involved**:  
   - The speed of light in a vacuum is a fundamental constant in physics, approximately 300,000,000 meters per second (m/s) or 3 × 10^8 m/s.  
   - The speed of sound depends on the medium it travels through. For example, in air at room temperature (around 20°C), it is approximately 343 m/s. In other media like water, it can be higher (e.g., about 1,480 m/s), but it varies significantly.

2. **Direct comparison under standard conditions**:  
   - Compare the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s) to the speed of sound in air (343 m/s).  
   - Calculation: 3 × 10^8 m/s ÷ 343 m/s ≈ 874,000. This means the speed of light is about 874,000 times faster than the speed of sound in air.

3. **Consider other media**:  
   - In water, the speed of sound is about 1,480 m/s, and the speed of light is reduced to approximately 225,000,000 m/s (due to the refractive index of water, about 1.33). Still, 225,000,000 m/s > 1,480 m/s.  
   - In solids like steel, sound can travel faster (e.g., about 5,960 m/s), but light's speed in such materials is still much higher (e.g., around 200,000,000 m/s or more, depending on the material).  
   - Sound requires a medium to propagate, while light can travel through a vacuum. Even when light slows down in a medium, it remains faster than sound in that same medium.

4. **Scientific principle**:  
   - This difference is a well-established fact in physics. For instance, we observe phenomena like seeing lightning before hearing thunder because light travels faster than sound.

5. **Universal conclusion**:  
   - Across all known conditions and media, the speed of light is always greater than the speed of sound. There are no scenarios where sound exceeds the speed of light.

### Final Answer:  
Yes
