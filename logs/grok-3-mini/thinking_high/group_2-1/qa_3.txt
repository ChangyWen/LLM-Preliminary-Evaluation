*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Did Albert Einstein die later than Isaac Newton?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I need to recall the death years of both scientists.

Starting with Isaac Newton. He was born in 1643 and died in 1727. Yes, that's correct. Newton lived in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Now, Albert Einstein. He was born in 1879 and died in 1955. Einstein died in 1955, that's right.

So, Newton died in 1727, and Einstein died in 1955.

Now, I need to compare these two dates: 1727 and 1955.

Clearly, 1955 is later than 1727. So, Einstein died after Newton.

But to be thorough, let's make sure the dates are accurate.

Isaac Newton: Born December 25, 1642 (Julian calendar), but often listed as 1643 in Gregorian. Died March 31, 1727. That's standard.

Albert Einstein: Born March 14, 1879, died April 18, 1955. Yes.

So, death year for Newton: 1727

Death year for Einstein: 1955

1955 > 1727, so Einstein died later.

The question is about who died later, not who was born later. But just to confirm, Einstein was born much later, in 1879, while Newton was born in 1643, so obviously Einstein lived in a later era.

But the key is the death dates.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall death year of Isaac Newton: 1727.

2. Recall death year of Albert Einstein: 1955.

3. Compare the years: 1955 is greater than 1727.

4. Therefore, Einstein died later than Newton.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "die later," which means after in time, so yes.

I should ensure there are no tricks, like different calendars, but in standard historical context, this is fine.

So, the answer is Yes.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To answer the question "Did Albert Einstein die later than Isaac Newton?", I will reason step by step based on historical facts.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the death year of Isaac Newton**: Isaac Newton, the English mathematician and physicist, died on March 31, 1727. This is a well-documented historical fact.
   
2. **Identify the death year of Albert Einstein**: Albert Einstein, the German-born theoretical physicist, died on April 18, 1955. This is also a well-established fact.

3. **Compare the death years**: 
   - Newton's death year: 1727
   - Einstein's death year: 1955
   - Since 1955 is greater than 1727, Einstein's death occurred later in time.

4. **Consider any potential nuances**: 
   - The comparison is based on the Gregorian calendar, which is the standard for historical dating. There are no significant calendar discrepancies that would affect this comparison.
   - The question specifically asks about the order of their deaths, not their births or other aspects of their lives.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the death years, Einstein died after Newton.

### Final Answer: Yes
