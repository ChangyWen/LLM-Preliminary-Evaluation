*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the melting point of ice lower than the boiling point of water?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that ice is the solid form of water, and water is the liquid form. The melting point is the temperature at which a solid turns into a liquid, and the boiling point is the temperature at which a liquid turns into a gas.

For water, the melting point of ice is 0 degrees Celsius, and the boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius. This is under standard atmospheric pressure.

Now, the question is asking if the melting point is lower than the boiling point. So, is 0°C less than 100°C? Yes, obviously.

But I should make sure there are no tricks here. Is there any condition where this might not be true? For example, at different pressures, the melting and boiling points can change. But the question doesn't specify any conditions, so I think it's safe to assume standard conditions.

Let me confirm the values:

- Melting point of ice: 0°C (or 273 K)

- Boiling point of water: 100°C (or 373 K)

Comparing 0°C and 100°C, 0 is indeed less than 100.

So, the melting point is lower than the boiling point.

The answer should be Yes.

The question says "ice" and "water," but it's clear that it's referring to the same substance, H2O, just in different states.

Also, the question is straightforward, no mention of impurities or anything that could change the points.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the melting point of ice: 0°C.

2. Identify the boiling point of water: 100°C.

3. Compare the two temperatures: 0°C < 100°C.

4. Therefore, the melting point is lower than the boiling point.

Final answer: Yes.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the melting point of ice**: The melting point of ice (the temperature at which solid ice turns into liquid water) is 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm).

2. **Identify the boiling point of water**: The boiling point of water (the temperature at which liquid water turns into water vapor) is 100°C under the same standard atmospheric pressure.

3. **Compare the two temperatures**: The melting point (0°C) is less than the boiling point (100°C). This is a direct numerical comparison.

4. **Consider any conditions**: The question does not specify unusual conditions like high pressure or impurities, so we assume standard conditions. Under these conditions, the melting point is always lower than the boiling point for water.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, the melting point of ice is indeed lower than the boiling point of water.

Final answer: Yes.
