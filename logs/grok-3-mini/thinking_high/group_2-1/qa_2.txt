*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Mount Everest taller than K2?" I need to provide a step-by-step reasoning process and end with a yes or no answer.

I know that Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, and K2 is the second highest. But I should confirm this with accurate information.

Step 1: Recall the heights of both mountains.

- Mount Everest: I remember it's about 8,848 meters tall. That's the standard height.

- K2: I think it's around 8,611 meters. I'm pretty sure it's less than Everest.

I should use reliable knowledge. From what I know:

- Mount Everest height: 8,848 meters (as of my last update).

- K2 height: 8,611 meters.

Step 2: Compare the heights.

- Everest: 8,848 m

- K2: 8,611 m

Clearly, 8,848 is greater than 8,611, so Everest is taller.

Step 3: Consider any nuances.

- Is there any debate about the heights? For example, sometimes mountains are measured from different bases or with different methods. But for standard elevation above sea level, Everest is universally recognized as the tallest.

- K2 is indeed the second highest mountain.

Step 4: Ensure the comparison is fair. The question is about "taller," which typically means height above sea level.

- Yes, both are compared based on elevation.

Step 5: Finalize the answer.

- Based on standard measurements, Mount Everest is taller than K2.

So, the answer should be "Yes."

Step 6: Structure the response.

- Start with step-by-step reasoning.

- End with "Yes" or "No."

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Identify the key question**: The query asks whether Mount Everest is taller than K2. "Taller" typically refers to the elevation above sea level, which is the standard metric for comparing mountain heights.

2. **Recall reliable height data**:
   - Mount Everest: Based on widely accepted measurements, its height is approximately 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. This figure was confirmed by a 2020 survey using advanced GPS technology.
   - K2: Its height is approximately 8,611 meters (28,251 feet) above sea level. This is also a well-established figure from multiple sources, including surveys by organizations like the National Geographic Society.

3. **Compare the heights**:
   - Mount Everest: 8,848 meters
   - K2: 8,611 meters
   - Performing a direct numerical comparison: 8,848 > 8,611. Therefore, Mount Everest is higher.

4. **Consider potential nuances**:
   - Mountain heights can sometimes be debated due to factors like measurement methods (e.g., from sea level vs. base camp) or recent geological changes. However, for standard elevation above sea level, Mount Everest is universally recognized as the tallest mountain in the world, and K2 is consistently ranked as the second tallest.
   - There are no credible sources or recent updates that challenge this order based on elevation.

5. **Conclude based on the comparison**: Since Mount Everest's height exceeds that of K2, the answer to the question is affirmative.

### Final Answer: Yes
