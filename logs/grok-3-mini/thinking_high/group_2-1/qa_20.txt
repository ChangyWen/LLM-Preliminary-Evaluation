*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the atomic number of oxygen higher than that of carbon?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that the atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom, which defines the element. It's also the position of the element in the periodic table.

I recall the atomic numbers of carbon and oxygen. Carbon is element number 6, and oxygen is element number 8. Let me double-check that.

Starting from the beginning: Hydrogen is 1, Helium is 2, Lithium is 3, Beryllium is 4, Boron is 5, Carbon is 6. Yes, carbon is atomic number 6.

After carbon: Nitrogen is 7, Oxygen is 8. Yes, oxygen is atomic number 8.

So, comparing the two: Carbon has atomic number 6, oxygen has atomic number 8.

Is 8 higher than 6? Yes, it is.

Therefore, the atomic number of oxygen is higher than that of carbon.

I should make sure I'm not confusing atomic number with atomic mass. Atomic mass is different; carbon has an atomic mass of about 12, oxygen about 16, but the question is about atomic number, not mass.

Also, in the periodic table, oxygen comes after carbon, so it has a higher atomic number.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall that atomic number is the number of protons and the element's position in the periodic table.

2. Atomic number of carbon: 6.

3. Atomic number of oxygen: 8.

4. Compare 8 and 6: 8 > 6.

5. Therefore, yes, oxygen's atomic number is higher.

Final answer should be Yes.

The question says "Show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)." So I need to present it clearly.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the concept of atomic number**: The atomic number of an element is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It also corresponds to the element's position in the periodic table.

2. **Recall the atomic number of carbon**: Carbon is the sixth element in the periodic table, so its atomic number is 6.

3. **Recall the atomic number of oxygen**: Oxygen is the eighth element in the periodic table, so its atomic number is 8.

4. **Compare the atomic numbers**: We need to compare 8 (oxygen) and 6 (carbon). Since 8 is greater than 6, oxygen's atomic number is higher.

5. **Verify against common misconceptions**: The question is specifically about atomic number, not atomic mass (which is approximately 12 for carbon and 16 for oxygen). The comparison is correct based on atomic number.

### Final Answer: Yes
