*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the Sahara Desert hotter than the Gobi Desert?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

To answer this, I need to compare the temperatures of the Sahara and Gobi Deserts. Temperature can be measured in different ways, like average annual temperature, highest recorded temperature, or average high temperatures. I should consider the most relevant metric for comparing "hotter." Probably, it's about the highest temperatures or average highs, since deserts are known for extreme heat.

Key facts I know:

- The Sahara Desert is in North Africa and is the largest hot desert in the world. It's famous for its extreme heat.

- The Gobi Desert is in Asia, spanning parts of China and Mongolia. It's a cold desert, meaning it can get very cold in winter, but it might still be hot in summer.

I recall that the Sahara has some of the highest temperatures recorded on Earth. For example, the highest temperature ever recorded was in Death Valley, but the Sahara has very high temperatures too. I think the record for Africa is in the Sahara.

Specific temperatures:

- Sahara Desert: Average high temperatures can reach over 40°C (104°F) in summer, and it can go higher. I think the highest recorded temperature in the Sahara is around 58°C (136°F) or something like that. Wait, no, I think the world record is 56.7°C in Death Valley, but Sahara might be close.

- Gobi Desert: It's colder because it's at a higher latitude and elevation. In summer, it can get hot, maybe up to 40°C, but in winter, it drops below freezing. So, it's not consistently hot like the Sahara.

I should look for average temperatures or reliable data. Since I'm reasoning step by step, I'll use general knowledge.

Factors affecting temperature:

- Latitude: Sahara is closer to the equator (around 20-30°N), so it gets more direct sunlight. Gobi is farther north (around 40-45°N), so less intense sunlight.

- Elevation: Gobi Desert has higher elevation in parts, which can make it cooler. Sahara is mostly low-lying.

- Climate type: Sahara is a subtropical desert with high temperatures year-round. Gobi is a temperate desert with seasonal variations, including cold winters.

From this, it seems the Sahara should be hotter.

But to be precise, let's think about average annual temperatures.

- Sahara: Average annual temperature is around 30°C or higher in some parts.

- Gobi: Average annual temperature might be lower, say around 10-15°C or less, because of cold winters.

I think the Gobi's average high in summer can be similar to Sahara's, but the lows are much lower.

For "hotter," it might refer to maximum temperatures or average highs.

Highest recorded temperatures:

- Sahara: I believe the highest temperature in the Sahara is about 58°C in places like Bilma or Al-'Aziziyah, but I think the record was disputed. Actually, the highest reliable record is in Death Valley, but Sahara has temperatures over 50°C.

- Gobi: I don't think it reaches as high. Probably maximum around 40-45°C.

Upon thinking, I recall that the Gobi Desert can have summer temperatures up to 40°C, but not as extreme as Sahara.

Another way is to consider the classification: Sahara is a hot desert, while Gobi is often classified as a cold desert.

So, generally, Sahara is hotter.

But to confirm, let's think about specific data.

From memory:

- Average July temperature (hottest month):

  - Sahara: Can be 40-50°C in some areas.

  - Gobi: Around 25-30°C average high, I think. Wait, no, I think it can be higher.

I think Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia, near Gobi, has summer highs around 25°C, but deeper in the desert, it might be hotter.

Upon better recollection, the Gobi Desert can have temperatures up to 45°C in summer, but it's not consistent.

Whereas Sahara regularly exceeds 40°C.

Moreover, the Sahara has a higher average temperature.

I think it's safe to say yes, Sahara is hotter.

But to be thorough, is there any part of Gobi that might be hotter? Probably not.

Final reasoning: Based on geographical location, climate classification, and general knowledge, the Sahara Desert experiences higher temperatures than the Gobi Desert.

So, the answer should be Yes.

The question is "Is the Sahara Desert hotter than the Gobi Desert?" and I need to say Yes or No.

I think Yes.

But just to make sure, is there any metric where Gobi could be hotter? Like, perhaps average low temperatures or something, but that doesn't make sense for "hotter."

No, definitely Sahara is hotter.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
To determine whether the Sahara Desert is hotter than the Gobi Desert, I'll reason step by step based on key factors like location, climate, average temperatures, and extreme heat records. I'll use general knowledge of geography and climate science, as this is a reasoning exercise.

### Step 1: Understand the key characteristics of each desert
- **Sahara Desert**: Located in North Africa, primarily between 15°N and 30°N latitude. It's a subtropical desert with high temperatures year-round due to its proximity to the equator, low elevation, and dry conditions. It's classified as a hot desert.
- **Gobi Desert**: Located in Asia, spanning parts of northern China and southern Mongolia, roughly between 37°N and 46°N latitude. It's a temperate desert with significant seasonal variations, including cold winters, and is often classified as a cold desert due to its higher elevation and northern location.

### Step 2: Compare key temperature metrics
Temperature can be compared using several metrics, such as average annual temperature, average high temperatures in the hottest month, and record highs. I'll focus on these, as "hotter" typically refers to higher temperatures, especially in the context of deserts.

- **Average annual temperature**:
  - Sahara: Around 25–30°C (77–86°F) in most areas, with some regions exceeding 30°C (86°F). This is consistently high due to its equatorial proximity and lack of seasonal variation.
  - Gobi: Around 5–15°C (41–59°F), depending on the location. The higher latitude and elevation lead to colder winters, pulling the annual average down.
  - **Comparison**: The Sahara has a higher average annual temperature.

- **Average high temperature in the hottest month (e.g., July)**:
  - Sahara: Often exceeds 40°C (104°F), with some areas reaching 45–50°C (113–122°F) during peak summer. For example, in places like Timbuktu or Bilma, highs can be extreme.
  - Gobi: Can reach 30–40°C (86–104°F) in summer, but this is less consistent and typically lower than the Sahara. Areas like Dalanzadgad might hit 35–40°C (95–104°F) on hot days.
  - **Comparison**: The Sahara generally has higher average highs in the hottest periods.

- **Record high temperatures**:
  - Sahara: Has recorded temperatures over 50°C (122°F) in some locations, with the highest reliable record in Africa being around 58°C (136°F) in places like Al-'Aziziyah (though some records are disputed). It's known for extreme heat events.
  - Gobi: Record highs are typically around 40–45°C (104–113°F), but these are rare and not as extreme as the Sahara's. The Gobi's climate is moderated by its elevation and continental position.
  - **Comparison**: The Sahara has higher recorded maximum temperatures.

### Step 3: Consider influencing factors
- **Latitude and sunlight**: The Sahara is closer to the equator, receiving more direct sunlight year-round, which contributes to higher temperatures. The Gobi, being farther north, receives less intense sunlight and experiences greater seasonal changes.
- **Elevation**: The Gobi has higher average elevation (e.g., parts are over 1,000 meters or 3,280 feet), which cools temperatures. The Sahara is mostly low-lying, amplifying heat.
- **Climate type**: The Sahara is arid and hot with minimal rainfall, leading to extreme heat retention. The Gobi has a more varied climate, with cold winters (temperatures can drop below -30°C or -22°F), making it less "hot" overall.
- **Other factors**: Wind patterns, such as the hot, dry winds in the Sahara, can increase temperatures, while the Gobi's location in a continental interior leads to temperature extremes but not consistently high heat.

### Step 4: Address potential edge cases
- Could the Gobi be hotter in specific conditions? In rare summer heatwaves, the Gobi might approach Sahara-like temperatures (e.g., 40°C), but this is not sustained. The Sahara consistently experiences higher heat across most metrics.
- Definition of "hotter": If we interpret "hotter" strictly as maximum recorded temperature or average highs, the Sahara clearly wins. Even if we consider annual averages, the Sahara is hotter.

### Step 5: Conclusion
Based on the comparisons above—average annual temperature, average highs, record highs, and influencing factors—the Sahara Desert is consistently hotter than the Gobi Desert. The Sahara's subtropical location and climate make it a prime example of extreme heat, while the Gobi's temperate and elevated nature result in lower overall temperatures.

**Final answer: Yes**
