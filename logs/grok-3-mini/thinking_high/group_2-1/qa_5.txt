*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Russia larger in area than Australia?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that Russia is the largest country in the world by land area. I recall that Russia spans across Europe and Asia, and it's massive. Australia is a continent and a country, and it's also large, but I think it's smaller than Russia.

To be precise, I should recall the actual land areas. From memory, Russia's land area is about 17 million square kilometers. I think it's 17,098,242 square kilometers. And Australia is around 7.6 or 7.7 million square kilometers. I think Australia's land area is approximately 7,692,024 square kilometers.

Comparing those numbers: 17 million vs. 7.7 million. Clearly, 17 million is larger than 7.7 million, so Russia is larger.

I should make sure I'm not confusing the numbers. Let me double-check my memory. I know that the top largest countries by area are:

1. Russia

2. Canada

3. United States

4. China

5. Brazil

6. Australia

Yes, Australia is usually listed as the sixth largest country by area. So, it's smaller than Russia.

To be thorough, let's consider if there's any trick here. The question is about area, which I assume means land area. Sometimes people might confuse with population or other metrics, but it's specifically "area."

Also, ensure that we're talking about the countries as they are defined. Russia includes its entire territory, and Australia is the island continent country.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Recall the approximate land areas:

   - Russia: approximately 17,098,000 sq km

   - Australia: approximately 7,692,000 sq km

2. Compare the two: 17,098,000 > 7,692,000, so Russia is larger.

3. Confirm with general knowledge: Russia is the largest country, Australia is smaller.

4. No need for exact figures since the difference is significant, but if I want to be precise, I can state that based on standard geographical data, Russia is larger.

Final answer should be Yes, Russia is larger in area than Australia.

The question says "Show me your step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer (Yes or No)." So, I need to box the final answer.

Also, ensure that my response is clear and not verbose.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the key metric**: The question asks about the area (land area) of Russia and Australia. I will compare their total land areas based on standard geographical data.

2. **Recall approximate land areas**:
   - Russia's land area is approximately 17,098,242 square kilometers (km²). It is widely recognized as the largest country in the world by land area.
   - Australia's land area is approximately 7,692,024 square kilometers (km²). It is the sixth-largest country by land area.

3. **Perform a direct comparison**:
   - Russia's area (17,098,242 km²) is greater than Australia's area (7,692,024 km²).
   - The difference is significant: Russia is roughly 2.22 times larger than Australia.

4. **Consider potential edge cases**:
   - The comparison is based on total land area, excluding water bodies or other metrics like population.
   - There are no ambiguities in the definitions: Russia refers to the Russian Federation, and Australia refers to the continent-country.

5. **Conclusion from comparison**: Based on the data, Russia has a larger land area than Australia.

### Final Answer: Yes
