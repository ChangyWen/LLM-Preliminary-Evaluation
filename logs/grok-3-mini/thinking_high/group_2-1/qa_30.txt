*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the average human lifespan longer than that of a dog?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Step 1: Understand what is being asked. The question compares the average lifespan of humans to that of dogs. I need to recall or know the average lifespans for both.

Step 2: Recall average human lifespan. From general knowledge, the average human lifespan is around 70 to 80 years, depending on the country. For example, in many developed countries, it's about 75-80 years, and globally, it's probably around 72-73 years. I should use a standard figure. Let's say approximately 72 years for global average.

Step 3: Recall average dog lifespan. Dogs' lifespans vary by breed and size. Smaller dogs live longer, up to 15-20 years, while larger breeds might live only 7-10 years. A common average I've heard is around 10-13 years. I think a standard estimate is about 10-12 years for dogs.

Step 4: Compare the two. Human average: ~72 years. Dog average: ~10-12 years. Clearly, 72 is greater than 10-12, so yes, human lifespan is longer.

Step 5: Be precise. I should use more accurate figures if possible. From memory:

- World Health Organization or similar sources: Global average human life expectancy is about 73 years (as of recent years).

- For dogs: According to various sources, the average lifespan of a dog is often cited as 10-13 years. For example, the American Kennel Club might say 10-13 years.

Even if I take the lower end for humans or higher end for dogs, humans still live longer. Minimum human average is probably not less than 60 in most places, and dogs don't exceed 20 years on average.

Step 6: Consider any caveats. The question says "average human lifespan" and "that of a dog." It might imply a typical dog, but dogs vary. However, in general comparisons, we use averages. Also, human lifespan can vary by region, but overall, it's longer.

Step 7: Ensure the comparison is fair. Are we talking about the same metrics? Lifespan typically means average life expectancy at birth.

Step 8: Final comparison: Human average ~72 years vs. Dog average ~11 years (let's average 10-12). 72 > 11, so yes.

Step 9: Conclusion. Based on standard knowledge, the answer should be Yes.

Final Answer: Yes

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Define the key terms**: The question asks about the *average lifespan*, which typically refers to the average life expectancy at birth for a species. For humans, this is often based on global or regional data, and for dogs, it varies by breed but can be generalized.

2. **Research and recall average human lifespan**: 
   - According to reliable sources like the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations data, the global average human life expectancy is approximately 73 years as of recent estimates (e.g., 2023 data). This can vary by country—e.g., higher in developed nations (around 80 years) and lower in some developing regions (around 60-70 years)—but the global average is a good benchmark.

3. **Research and recall average dog lifespan**:
   - Dogs' lifespans vary significantly by breed, size, and care. Smaller breeds (e.g., Chihuahuas) can live 15-20 years, while larger breeds (e.g., Great Danes) often live only 7-10 years. According to sources like the American Kennel Club (AKC) and veterinary studies, the average lifespan for all dogs is commonly estimated at 10-13 years. A midpoint average of about 11-12 years is often used for general comparisons.

4. **Compare the two averages**:
   - Human average lifespan: ~73 years.
   - Dog average lifespan: ~11-12 years.
   - Numerically, 73 years is greater than 11-12 years. Even if we consider the lower end of human lifespan (e.g., 60 years in some regions) or the higher end for dogs (e.g., 13 years), humans still have a longer average lifespan.

5. **Consider potential factors and caveats**:
   - Human lifespan can be influenced by factors like healthcare, diet, and location, but the global average remains consistently higher than that of dogs.
   - Dog lifespan depends on breed, but even the longest-lived breeds rarely exceed 20 years, and the average across all breeds is much lower.
   - The comparison is based on averages, so individual cases (e.g., a human living to 100 or a dog living to 15) don't change the overall trend.

6. **Draw a conclusion**: Based on the data, the average human lifespan is clearly longer than the average dog lifespan.

### Final Answer: Yes
