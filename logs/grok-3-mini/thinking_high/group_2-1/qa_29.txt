*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is the wavelength of red light longer than that of blue light?" I need to reason step by step and then give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and different colors correspond to different wavelengths. The visible light spectrum goes from red to violet, with red having the longest wavelength and violet the shortest.

Red light has a longer wavelength than blue light. Blue light is closer to the violet end, so it should have a shorter wavelength.

Recall the approximate wavelengths: red light is around 620-750 nanometers, and blue light is around 450-495 nanometers. So, yes, red has a longer wavelength.

The question is straightforward, but I need to show step-by-step reasoning.

Step 1: Understand that light colors are associated with different wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum.

Step 2: Recall the order of colors in the visible spectrum: ROYGBIV (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet). This order is from longest wavelength to shortest wavelength.

Step 3: Based on this, red is at one end with longer wavelengths, and blue is towards the other end with shorter wavelengths.

Step 4: Confirm with approximate values: Red light wavelength is about 650 nm, blue light is about 470 nm. 650 > 470, so red has a longer wavelength.

Step 5: Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

I should make sure there's no trick here. Is there any context where this might not be true? For example, in different mediums, but the question doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume standard vacuum or air conditions.

Also, the question says "red light" and "blue light," which typically refer to the standard colors in the visible spectrum.

Final answer should be Yes.

Now, structure my response:

- Start with reasoning.

- End with the answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the concept of light and wavelength**: Light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the color of light is determined by its wavelength. Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs of a wave, measured in nanometers (nm) for visible light.

2. **Recall the visible light spectrum**: The visible light spectrum ranges from approximately 400 nm to 700 nm. The colors are ordered from longest wavelength to shortest wavelength as follows: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet (often remembered by the acronym ROYGBIV). This means red light has the longest wavelengths in the visible spectrum, while violet has the shortest.

3. **Compare red and blue light specifically**:
   - Red light typically has wavelengths in the range of 620–750 nm.
   - Blue light typically has wavelengths in the range of 450–495 nm.
   - Comparing these ranges, 620–750 nm (red) is greater than 450–495 nm (blue), so red light has a longer wavelength.

4. **Consider any exceptions or contexts**: In standard conditions (e.g., in a vacuum or air), the wavelength order remains consistent. The question does not specify unusual conditions, so we can assume typical visible light behavior. There are no common scenarios where blue light would have a longer wavelength than red light.

5. **Conclusion based on evidence**: Based on the standard electromagnetic spectrum and the typical wavelength ranges for red and blue light, red light indeed has a longer wavelength than blue light.

### Final Answer: Yes
