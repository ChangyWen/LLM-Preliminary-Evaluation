*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is a blue whale heavier than an elephant?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

I know that blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, and elephants are large but not as big. I should confirm this with some facts.

Recall some weights. A blue whale can weigh up to 200 tons. I think it's around 100 to 150 tons for adults. I need to be precise.

A blue whale's weight: I remember that the average blue whale weighs about 100 to 150 metric tons. The heaviest recorded was around 190 tons. Let's use approximate figures.

An elephant's weight: African elephants, the largest land animals, weigh up to about 6 to 7 tons. I think the maximum is around 6-7 metric tons for males.

Compare the units. Both should be in the same unit. Metric tons are fine.

So, blue whale: minimum adult weight is around 50 tons for smaller ones, but typically 100-150 tons. Let's say average is 100 tons.

Elephant: African elephant bulls can weigh up to 6 tons, Asian elephants less, around 5 tons.

Clearly, 100 tons vs. 6 tons, so blue whale is heavier.

But to be thorough, is there any elephant that could be heavier? No, elephants are land animals, and blue whales are marine mammals, so blue whales are much larger.

The question says "an elephant," which could be any elephant, but typically we compare the largest of each. Even the smallest blue whale is probably heavier than the largest elephant.

Smallest blue whale: I think newborn blue whales are heavy, but adults are large. A newborn blue whale can weigh up to 2-3 tons, and grow quickly. But adult blue whales are massive.

Adult blue whale weight: According to my knowledge, an average blue whale weighs about 100-150 metric tons, while the largest elephants weigh about 6-7 metric tons.

So, 100 tons vs. 7 tons, difference is huge.

Confirm units: 1 metric ton = 1000 kg, so blue whale around 100,000 kg to 150,000 kg, elephant up to 7,000 kg.

Yes, blue whale is heavier.

Is there any trick here? Like, is the question referring to something else? No, it's straightforward.

Final answer should be Yes.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the animals: blue whale and elephant.

2. Recall sizes: blue whale is the largest animal, elephant is the largest land animal.

3. Approximate weights:

   - Blue whale: 100-150 metric tons (100,000-150,000 kg)

   - Elephant (African): up to 6-7 metric tons (6,000-7,000 kg)

4. Compare: 100,000 kg > 7,000 kg, so yes.

5. Even the smallest adult blue whale is likely heavier than the largest elephant. A small adult blue whale might be 50 tons, still much heavier than 7 tons.

6. Conclusion: Yes, a blue whale is heavier than an elephant.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the animals and their general size categories**: 
   - The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth and is a marine mammal.
   - The elephant is the largest land animal, with African elephants being the heaviest species.

2. **Recall approximate weights based on reliable knowledge**:
   - Blue whale: Adult blue whales typically weigh between 100 and 150 metric tons (100,000 to 150,000 kg). The heaviest recorded blue whale weighed around 190 metric tons.
   - Elephant: The largest elephants, such as African bush elephants, can weigh up to 6 to 7 metric tons (6,000 to 7,000 kg). Asian elephants are smaller, weighing up to about 5 metric tons.

3. **Compare the weights**:
   - Even the smallest adult blue whale (around 50-70 metric tons) is significantly heavier than the largest elephant (up to 7 metric tons).
   - For example, a typical blue whale at 100 metric tons (100,000 kg) is about 14-17 times heavier than a large elephant at 6-7 metric tons (6,000-7,000 kg).

4. **Consider edge cases**:
   - The question refers to "an elephant," which could imply any elephant, but even the largest elephant is far lighter than the smallest adult blue whale.
   - Blue whale calves (newborns) can weigh 2-3 metric tons, which might be comparable to a large elephant, but the question likely refers to adults, as is standard in such comparisons.

5. **Conclusion based on the comparison**:
   - Across all typical adult sizes, a blue whale is consistently heavier than an elephant.

### Final Answer: Yes
