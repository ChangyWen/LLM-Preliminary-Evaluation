*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is Antarctica colder than the Arctic?" I need to reason step by step and give a final answer of Yes or No.

Key elements: Antarctica and the Arctic. Antarctica is a continent surrounded by ocean, while the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by continents. This difference might affect their temperatures.

Step 1: Recall what I know about temperatures in these regions.

- Antarctica: It's the coldest place on Earth. The lowest temperature ever recorded was at Vostok Station in Antarctica, around -89.2°C. Also, the South Pole is very cold.

- Arctic: It's cold too, but not as extreme. The North Pole region has temperatures that can drop to around -40°C or lower in winter, but it's generally warmer than Antarctica because of the ocean's influence.

Step 2: Think about average temperatures.

- Antarctica's average annual temperature at the South Pole is about -49°C.

- Arctic's average annual temperature in the central Arctic is around -30°C to -40°C, but it varies. The Arctic Ocean moderates temperatures more than the Antarctic continent.

I should confirm these figures. From general knowledge:

- Antarctica has higher elevation, which makes it colder. The Antarctic Plateau is very high, leading to lower temperatures.

- The Arctic has sea ice, but the ocean beneath can retain heat, making it relatively warmer.

Step 3: Consider seasonal variations.

- Both regions have extreme seasonal changes, but Antarctica might have lower minimum temperatures.

- In winter, Antarctica can get extremely cold, while the Arctic, being surrounded by landmasses, might have slightly higher temperatures due to ocean currents.

Step 4: Look at specific data.

- Lowest temperature recorded: Antarctica holds the record at -89.2°C in 1983.

- In the Arctic, the lowest temperature is around -70°C in some parts of Siberia or Greenland, but Greenland is part of the Arctic region and can be very cold. However, the Arctic as a whole doesn't have temperatures as low as Antarctica's extremes.

Greenland is in the Arctic, and its interior can be very cold, but the average for the Arctic region is still higher than Antarctica's.

Step 5: Compare averages.

- Average temperature at the South Pole (Antarctica): about -60°C in winter, annual average around -49°C.

- Average temperature at the North Pole (Arctic): around -34°C annually, with winter lows around -40°C to -50°C.

I think the North Pole's average is higher. Let me think: the Arctic is warming faster due to climate change, but historically, Antarctica is colder.

Step 6: Reason based on geography.

- Antarctica is a large landmass covered in ice, with high elevation (average about 2,000-3,000 meters), which contributes to colder temperatures.

- The Arctic is mostly ocean, with lower elevation, and the ocean acts as a heat sink, keeping temperatures milder.

- Also, Antarctica is farther from the equator in terms of the pole, but both are at similar latitudes in a way, but the continentality effect makes Antarctica colder.

The South Pole is at a higher elevation and is more isolated, leading to less heat exchange.

Step 7: Conclusion from reasoning.

Based on this, Antarctica is generally colder than the Arctic. The extreme cold records are in Antarctica, and average temperatures are lower there.

Final answer should be Yes.

But to be precise, the question is "Is Antarctica colder than the Arctic?" which could be interpreted as comparing the two regions overall. I think it's safe to say yes.

Step 8: Ensure the answer format.

The user asked for "Yes or No" and step-by-step reasoning. So, I'll box the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Question**: The query asks whether Antarctica is colder than the Arctic. To answer this, I need to compare the two regions based on temperature data, including average temperatures, extreme lows, and geographical factors that influence climate.

2. **Define the Regions**:
   - Antarctica: A continent entirely covered by ice, with the South Pole located at its center. It has high elevation (average around 2,000–3,000 meters) and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean.
   - The Arctic: Not a continent but a region centered around the North Pole, consisting mostly of ocean covered by sea ice, surrounded by landmasses like Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia.

3. **Key Temperature Factors**:
   - **Elevation**: Antarctica's high elevation contributes to lower temperatures because air cools with altitude. The Arctic has lower average elevation due to its oceanic nature.
   - **Geography and Ocean Influence**: Antarctica is a large landmass that traps cold air, while the Arctic Ocean moderates temperatures by retaining heat. This makes the Arctic relatively warmer despite both being polar regions.
   - **Climate Data Sources**: I'll rely on well-established scientific records from sources like NASA, NOAA, and meteorological stations.

4. **Compare Average Temperatures**:
   - Antarctica: The annual average temperature at the South Pole is approximately -49°C. In winter, it can drop to around -60°C or lower.
   - Arctic: The annual average temperature in the central Arctic (e.g., near the North Pole) is about -34°C. Winter lows can reach -40°C to -50°C in some areas, but the ocean influence keeps it milder overall.
   - Conclusion from averages: Antarctica's averages are consistently lower, indicating it is colder year-round.

5. **Compare Extreme Temperatures**:
   - Antarctica: Holds the record for the lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth at -89.2°C (at Vostok Station in 1983). Other stations like the South Pole report extremes around -80°C.
   - Arctic: The lowest recorded temperatures are around -70°C (e.g., in Greenland or Siberia, which are part of the Arctic region). However, these are not as extreme as Antarctica's records.
   - Conclusion from extremes: Antarctica experiences colder extremes, reinforcing its status as the colder region.

6. **Consider Other Influences**:
   - **Seasonal Variations**: Both regions have harsh winters, but Antarctica's isolation and lack of moderating ocean currents lead to more consistent and severe cold. The Arctic benefits from warmer ocean currents (e.g., the Gulf Stream's influence on nearby regions).
   - **Climate Change**: The Arctic is warming faster than Antarctica due to factors like ice-albedo feedback, but this doesn't change the historical and current temperature comparisons—Antarctica remains colder.
   - **Overall Regional Comparison**: When considering the entire region, Antarctica's continental nature and higher latitude effects make it colder than the Arctic's mix of ocean and land.

7. **Synthesize the Evidence**:
   - Based on average temperatures, extreme lows, and geographical factors, Antarctica is colder than the Arctic in all key metrics. This is supported by scientific consensus from organizations like the British Antarctic Survey and the National Snow and Ice Data Center.

### Final Answer: Yes
