*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
First, the question is: "Is a cheetah faster than a lion?" I need to provide a step-by-step reasoning process and end with a yes or no answer.

Step 1: Understand the key elements. The question is about speed, specifically comparing the maximum or typical speeds of a cheetah and a lion.

Step 2: Recall what I know about animal speeds. From general knowledge, cheetahs are known as the fastest land animals. I think their top speed is around 60-70 miles per hour. Lions are fast too, but I believe they're not as fast as cheetahs.

Step 3: Verify the speeds with approximate figures. 
- Cheetah: Top speed is about 60-70 mph (97-113 km/h). I've heard 70 mph is a common figure.
- Lion: I think lions can run up to 35-50 mph (56-80 km/h). They're predators but not specialized for speed like cheetahs.

Step 4: Consider the context. The question is straightforward, so I should base it on general biological facts. Cheetahs are built for short bursts of high speed, while lions are more about endurance and strength.

Step 5: Think about any exceptions or nuances. Are there any lions that might be faster? Probably not, as species averages are what matter. Also, speed can vary, but cheetahs consistently outpace lions in records.

Step 6: Step-by-step reasoning outline:
- State the known top speeds.
- Compare them directly.
- Conclude based on the comparison.

Step 7: Final answer should be yes or no. Based on my knowledge, yes, a cheetah is faster than a lion.

Step 8: Make sure the response is clear and structured. Start with reasoning, end with the answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:

1. **Identify the key comparison**: The question is about speed, specifically whether a cheetah is faster than a lion. Speed in animals is typically measured by their maximum recorded or average top speeds over short distances.

2. **Recall general knowledge on animal speeds**:
   - Cheetahs are widely recognized as the fastest land animals. Their top speed is approximately 60-70 miles per hour (97-113 kilometers per hour), achieved in short bursts during hunts. This is due to their lightweight build, long legs, and specialized muscles.
   - Lions, while agile predators, are not primarily built for speed. Their top speed is estimated to be around 35-50 miles per hour (56-80 kilometers per hour), with most sources citing an average maximum of about 50 mph. Lions rely more on strength, endurance, and pack hunting rather than raw speed.

3. **Compare the speeds directly**:
   - Cheetah's top speed: 60-70 mph.
   - Lion's top speed: 35-50 mph.
   - Based on these figures, the cheetah's maximum speed range is consistently higher than the lion's. Even at the lower end of the cheetah's speed (60 mph), it exceeds the upper end of the lion's speed (50 mph).

4. **Consider factors that could affect the comparison**:
   - Speed can vary based on individual animals, terrain, and conditions, but on average and in terms of maximum recorded speeds, cheetahs outperform lions.
   - Cheetahs are specialized sprinters, while lions are more versatile but slower. There are no documented cases where lions regularly exceed cheetah speeds in natural settings.

5. **Draw a conclusion**: Based on reliable biological data and comparisons, the cheetah is faster than the lion in terms of top speed.

### Final Answer: Yes
