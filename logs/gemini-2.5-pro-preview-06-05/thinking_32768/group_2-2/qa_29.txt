*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if blue light has a longer wavelength than red light. My mind immediately jumps into problem-solving mode.

First, I need a clear strategy. They want a step-by-step explanation and a definitive "yes" or "no" answer. Alright, no problem.

I start by thinking about the basics: what do I know about visible light? It's part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and that’s where I’ll ground the answer. Next, I instantly recall ROY G BIV – the classic mnemonic for the visible spectrum's colors. Perfect. Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. This is the core.

Now, how does ROY G BIV relate to what the user is asking? I know that the mnemonic represents a sequence of wavelengths. The longest wavelengths are at the "red" end, and the shortest wavelengths are at the "violet" end. The order is fundamental: as you go from red to violet, the wavelength *decreases*. Frequency and energy *increase* in that same progression.

So, back to the question: is blue light's wavelength *longer* than red's? No, that's incorrect, based on how the spectrum and the mnemonic work. Red is at the "long wavelength" end, and blue is more toward the short wavelength end.

To be thorough, I need to flesh out that explanation. I'll explain the electromagnetic spectrum first, then go into the specifics of the colors. I'll use ROY G BIV to illustrate that Red is first, and Blue is later, meaning Red has a longer wavelength.

I should also inject some specific numbers to clinch the answer. Let me pull up those values. Ah, yes: red light is around 620-750 nanometers, while blue light is in the 450-495 nanometer range. Boom. That numerical difference *solidifies* the point.

Finally, I'll reiterate that as the wavelength gets shorter, frequency and energy rise. This shows I understand the relationship between these properties.

Ultimately, I'll present the answer first for immediate clarity: **No.** Then I'll give the detailed step-by-step explanation, complete with the reasoning, the mnemonic, and the numerical data to back everything up. I think I've got it all covered. The answer will be well-structured and complete.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **The Visible Light Spectrum:** Visible light is a small part of the broader electromagnetic spectrum. Our eyes perceive different wavelengths within this part of the spectrum as different colors.

2.  **The Order of Colors (ROY G BIV):** The colors of the visible spectrum are famously remembered by the acronym ROY G BIV, which stands for:
    *   **R**ed
    *   **O**range
    *   **Y**ellow
    *   **G**reen
    *   **B**lue
    *   **I**ndigo
    *   **V**iolet

3.  **Wavelength and the Spectrum:** This order of colors is arranged from the **longest wavelength to the shortest wavelength**.
    *   Red light is at the beginning of this sequence, meaning it has the longest wavelength.
    *   Violet light is at the end of the sequence, meaning it has the shortest wavelength.

4.  **Comparing Red and Blue:**
    *   In the ROY G BIV sequence, **Red** comes first.
    *   **Blue** comes much later in the sequence, just before Indigo and Violet.
    *   Since the sequence goes from longest to shortest wavelength, this means that red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

5.  **Numerical Values (for confirmation):**
    *   The wavelength of **red light** is approximately **620 to 750 nanometers (nm)**.
    *   The wavelength of **blue light** is approximately **450 to 495 nanometers (nm)**.
    *   Comparing these numbers, 620-750 nm is clearly a longer wavelength than 450-495 nm.

### Final Answer

**No.**

The wavelength of blue light is shorter than that of red light.
