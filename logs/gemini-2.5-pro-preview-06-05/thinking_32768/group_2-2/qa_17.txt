Alright, let's break this down. The user wants to know if Mars has more moons than Earth, and they want a detailed explanation. My initial thought is to deconstruct their request.  I need a clear "yes" or "no" at the end, and a step-by-step thought process.

First, I'll need to remember how many moons each planet has. Earth's easy – it's got one, our Moon. Mars has moons too… Phobos and Deimos, right? Okay, so that's two. Now I can see that Mars has more.

So, how to present this clearly? I'll structure it as requested. Step 1: Earth's moons. Step 2: Mars's moons. Step 3: Compare the numbers. Step 4: The answer.

Now, to flesh out the steps. For Earth, I'll state it clearly: "Earth has one moon, 'the Moon'". For Mars, I'll say "Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos." I can even add that they are asteroid-like objects, just to be thorough.

The comparison step will be simple: Earth has 1, Mars has 2, and therefore, 2 is greater than 1.

Finally, the answer is "Yes".

I'm going to go back and review my draft. It is accurate, but a little terse. It needs to be more detailed to satisfy the request for a reasoning process.

Revised, the format will be: "Step-by-Step Reasoning".

*   Step 1: State that Earth has one moon, "the Moon".
*   Step 2: Then state that Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.
*   Step 3: Make the comparison explicit: Earth has 1, Mars has 2; therefore, Mars has more.
*   Final Answer: "Yes".

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Count Earth's Moons:** First, we identify the number of natural moons orbiting the Earth. Earth has **one** natural moon, which we simply call "the Moon".

2.  **Count Mars's Moons:** Next, we identify the number of natural moons orbiting Mars. Mars has **two** natural moons. They are named Phobos and Deimos.

3.  **Compare the Totals:** Finally, we compare the moon counts of the two planets.
    *   Earth's count: 1
    *   Mars's count: 2

    Since 2 is a larger number than 1, Mars has more moons than Earth.
