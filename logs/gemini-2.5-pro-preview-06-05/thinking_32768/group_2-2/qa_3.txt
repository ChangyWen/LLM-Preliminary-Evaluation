*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's my thought process: First, the question is, *did* Newton die later than Einstein? Right, simple enough. I need to break that down.

1.  **The core question:** Did Newton live longer than Einstein? That's the essence.

2.  **Deconstruction:** Let's clarify the components.
    *   Person A: Isaac Newton.
    *   Person B: Albert Einstein.
    *   Comparison: Date of death.
    *   Relationship: Did Newton's death occur *after* Einstein's?

3.  **Plan of attack:** I'll gather the dates, compare them, and give a "Yes" or "No" answer, while walking through the logic step by step, as instructed. Easy peasy.

4.  **Execution, here we go:**
    *   **Step 1: Newton's Death.**  I know this, but let's confirm. "Isaac Newton death date"... Okay, March 31, 1727.

    *   **Step 2: Einstein's Death.**  "Albert Einstein death date"... Got it, April 18, 1955.

    *   **Step 3: Date Comparison.**  Newton: 1727. Einstein: 1955. Obviously, 1727 is significantly earlier.

5.  **Synthesized Answer:** Okay, time to build the answer.
    *   **Step 1:** "First, let's establish the date of Isaac Newton's death." Isaac Newton died on March 31, 1727.
    *   **Step 2:** "Next, let's establish the date of Albert Einstein's death." Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955.
    *   **Step 3:** "Now, let's compare these two dates." The year 1727 comes before the year 1955.
    *   **Step 4:** "Therefore, Isaac Newton died much earlier than Albert Einstein."

    *   **Final Answer:** No.

6.  **Review:** Everything's in order, right? Clear, concise, follows all the instructions. Excellent.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Find Isaac Newton's date of death:** Isaac Newton died on March 31, 1727.
2.  **Find Albert Einstein's date of death:** Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955.
3.  **Compare the two dates:** The year 1727 occurred before the year 1955. Therefore, Isaac Newton died before Albert Einstein.

### Final Answer

No.
