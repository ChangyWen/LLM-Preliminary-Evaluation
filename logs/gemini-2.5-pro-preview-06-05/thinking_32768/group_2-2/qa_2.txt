*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this. The user wants a comparison between K2 and Everest, a step-by-step breakdown, and a clear "Yes/No" answer.

First, I'd deconstruct the question. "Is K2 taller than Everest?" My gut tells me "No," Everest is the highest, but I need to be precise. The user needs more than just an answer; they want the *reasoning*.

I need the facts. "Everest" immediately pops into my head. I know it's the highest. K2 is second. Okay, easy start. What are the heights? I have to be up-to-date. Everest is around 8,848 meters, but I better double-check that; it's been measured again recently. And K2 is around 8,611 meters. Right. Now, I'm going to want to format this logically.

I'll structure my answer like this:
1.  **Step 1: Establishing the Basics.** I'll need to get the heights of each mountain from the latest source, and I'll include both metric and imperial units for clarity. I should probably include a note about the official measuring bodies for extra points of credibility.
2.  **Step 2: K2's Official Height.** The same thing, official numbers, metric and imperial.
3.  **Step 3: Comparison.** Straightforward number comparison. I'll make sure to do the math and explicitly state the difference in meters and convert to feet for emphasis.
4.  **Step 4: Context & Extra Info.** I'll add some of the important context, like location (Himalayas vs. Karakoram) and the fact that Everest is the highest while K2 is the second-highest. I know that K2's nickname is "Savage Mountain." I'll use that to add a bit of "color" and explain why it's talked about so much.

Okay, now for the final part, which needs to be super clear. I'll start with a heading "Final Answer" and then boldly state the answer, "No." Then I'll follow up with a single sentence summary of the whole thing, just to drive the point home.

I should then read it all through to make sure it's clear, accurate, and meets the prompt.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Identify the official height of Mount Everest.**
Mount Everest is the world's highest mountain above sea level. Its official elevation, as recognized by both Nepal and China in 2020, is:
*   **8,848.86 meters** (29,031.7 feet)

**Step 2: Identify the official height of K2.**
K2 is the world's second-highest mountain above sea level. Its official elevation is:
*   **8,611 meters** (28,251 feet)

**Step 3: Compare the two heights.**
To determine which mountain is taller, we compare their elevations:
*   Mount Everest's height: 8,848.86 meters
*   K2's height: 8,611.00 meters

Comparing the two numbers, 8,848.86 is greater than 8,611.

**Step 4: Calculate the difference.**
Mount Everest is 237.86 meters (or about 780 feet) taller than K2. While K2 is famous for being technically more difficult and dangerous to climb, it is definitively shorter than Mount Everest.

### Final Answer

**No.**

Mount Everest is taller than K2.
