*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's my thought process: The user wants a simple "Yes or No" answer to whether the freezing point of water is higher than its boiling point, but they *also* want a detailed explanation. Fine, I can do that.

First, I need to immediately check my existing knowledge. I *know* the freezing point is 0°C (32°F), and the boiling point is 100°C (212°F) under standard conditions. So, just based on those numbers, the answer is clearly "No". But, that's not enough. I need to structure a logical argument.

Okay, here's how I'll approach it. First, define freezing point. Then, define boiling point. Next, I'll state the specific values, including both Celsius and Fahrenheit for clarity. Then and this is important, I will compare the values directly, using both temperature scales. Finally, I'll summarize the comparison, and give the "Yes or No" answer.

So, let's break it down.
Step 1: Freezing point. It's the point where water transitions from liquid to solid (ice). This occurs at 0°C or 32°F, at standard atmospheric pressure.
Step 2: Boiling point. It's where water changes from liquid to gas (steam). Again, at standard pressure, this happens at 100°C or 212°F.
Step 3: Time for the comparison. Is 0°C greater than 100°C? No, zero is clearly less than one hundred. In Fahrenheit, is 32°F greater than 212°F? Nope, 32 is far less than 212. This is the core of the answer.
Step 4: I can now formulate the conclusion. The freezing point is significantly lower than the boiling point in both common temperature scales.
Step 5: And now, the final answer:

**Final Answer: No**

Okay, that's it. I think it's clear, logically sound, and directly answers the question, with a clear "No" at the end, as requested. It provides that complete and step-by-step reasoning, and it's accessible. I've covered my bases, now I'm ready to submit.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Define the Freezing Point of Water**
The freezing point is the specific temperature at which a substance changes from a liquid to a solid. For water, this is the temperature at which liquid water turns into solid ice.

*   At standard atmospheric pressure, the freezing point of water is **0° Celsius (C)** or **32° Fahrenheit (F)**.

**Step 2: Define the Boiling Point of Water**
The boiling point is the specific temperature at which a substance changes from a liquid to a gas. For water, this is the temperature at which liquid water turns into gaseous steam.

*   At standard atmospheric pressure, the boiling point of water is **100° Celsius (C)** or **212° Fahrenheit (F)**.

**Step 3: Compare the Two Temperatures**
Now, we compare the numerical values of the freezing point and the boiling point.

*   **Using the Celsius scale:** Is 0°C higher than 100°C? No, 0 is less than 100.
*   **Using the Fahrenheit scale:** Is 32°F higher than 212°F? No, 32 is less than 212.

In both measurement systems, the temperature at which water freezes is a much lower number than the temperature at which it boils.

### Final Answer

**No.**

The freezing point of water (0°C / 32°F) is lower than the boiling point of water (100°C / 212°F).
