*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this question: "Is the average lifespan of a dog longer than that of a human?"

1.  **First, I break down the user's needs.** It wants a clear "Yes" or "No" answer, but it *also* wants the reasoning behind that answer laid out step-by-step. That's key.

2.  **Next, I gather my baseline knowledge.** I know the general lifespans. Humans usually live into their 70s, on average, at least in developed countries. Dogs? That's more variable. I immediately think about the size factor. Smaller dogs live longer than bigger ones.

3.  **I map out a logical process.**
    *   **Step 1:** Pinpoint the average human lifespan.
    *   **Step 2:** Figure out the average dog lifespan, but I'm *immediately* going to add the nuance of size.
    *   **Step 3:** I'll compare those two numbers.
    *   **Step 4:** Finally, I'll state the final answer.

4.  **Time to flesh out each step.**
    *   **Step 1: Human Lifespan.** I'd want to find a reputable source. The World Health Organization or the United Nations are good starting points. I'll do a quick search like "global average human life expectancy WHO." I'll pull a recent figure, let's say roughly 73 years. I'll remember that this is a *global* average, and of course, there's variation.

    *   **Step 2: Dog Lifespan.** This is trickier. I'll start with a general average. Search: "average dog lifespan." I'll probably see something like 10-13 years. *But* I'll immediately add the critical factor: breed and size matter enormously.
        *   **Small Dogs:** I'll look up their lifespans. They often live for 14-16 years, even potentially up to 20.
        *   **Medium Dogs:** Generally fall around the overall average, 10-13 years.
        *   **Large/Giant Dogs:** Their lifespans are often much shorter, maybe 6-9 years.
        *   I'll remember that this range has to be acknowledged.

    *   **Step 3: Compare.** I'll explicitly lay out the numbers: Human: ~73 years. Dog: ~10-13 years (with the crucial size/breed caveat). Clearly, the human lifespan is significantly longer. I might even point out the extreme cases; even the longest-lived dogs still don't approach the human average.

5.  **Final Answer:** Based on that direct comparison, the answer *must* be "No."

6.  **Finally, I'd review and refine.** I'd check: Is my answer clear and direct? Does it follow a logical structure? Is it well-organized and easy to understand? Does the explanation of the dog lifespan accurately reflect the breed-size variation? Am I clear in presenting the final "Yes or No" answer? Overall, I want this to be helpful, informative, and concise. It's a pretty straightforward question, and the answer is obvious.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Determine the average lifespan of a human.**
According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN), the global average life expectancy for humans is approximately **73 years**. This number can vary based on factors like country, gender, and access to healthcare, but 73 years is the accepted global average.

**Step 2: Determine the average lifespan of a dog.**
The average lifespan of a dog is not a single number, as it varies significantly based on breed, size, and health. However, we can establish a general range.
*   **Overall Average:** The overall average lifespan for all dog breeds is typically cited as **10 to 13 years**.
*   **Variation by Size:**
    *   **Small dogs** (like Chihuahuas and Dachshunds) generally live the longest, often **14 to 16 years** or more.
    *   **Large and giant dogs** (like Great Danes and Mastiffs) have the shortest lifespans, often only **6 to 9 years**.

**Step 3: Compare the two lifespans.**
Now, let's compare the figures from the previous steps.
*   Average Human Lifespan: **~73 years**
*   Average Dog Lifespan: **~10-13 years**

Even if we take the longest-living small dog breeds (around 16 years), this number is significantly shorter than the average human lifespan of 73 years.

### Final Answer

**No.**
