*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, let's get to work. The user's asking if the Gobi is hotter than the Sahara. Simple question, but needs a robust answer.

First, I need to understand what "hotter" *means*. Is it the highest recorded temperature? Average summer temperature? Yearly average? I'll address all of them. My gut tells me the Sahara is hotter overall, but let's build this step-by-step.

First, I will break the question down so that I can present a clear step-by-step argument. My first though is to create a list of the main things and then answer them one at a time.

Next, I'll associate some key words with each: "Sahara - hot, sand dunes, Africa, extreme heat, high temperatures." "Gobi - Asia, China/Mongolia, cold, rocky, temperature swings, brutal winters."

Now I need to structure my response.

*   **Step 1: Define "Hotter":** I'll need to emphasize record temperatures and average highs.

*   **Step 2: Sahara's Climate:** Location: North Africa. It's a subtropical desert. Key: direct sun, size, and little water. I need to remember specific temperature data now. Let's see... record highs around 55°C (131°F). Average highs in summer, around 40-47°C (104-117°F). Winters are mild.

*   **Step 3: Gobi's Climate:** Location: Northern China and Southern Mongolia. This is a cold desert, a continental climate. Key: high latitude, high elevation, and away from oceans. These lead to those extreme temperature swings. Data time... Record highs in summer are likely around 40°C (104°F) at the most, I'd guess. Average summer highs in the 25-35°C (77-95°F) range. The defining factor is the winter: brutal. Around -40°C (-40°F).

*   **Step 4: Direct Comparison:** Let's lay this out clearly.
    *   Metric 1: Record High - Sahara clearly wins.
    *   Metric 2: Average Summer - Sahara again.
    *   Metric 3: Year-Round Average - Sahara, with those cold Gobi winters dragging the average down.
    *   Metric 4: Temperature Range - Gobi wins. That huge swing is what makes it unique.

*   **Step 5: Conclusion:** Sahara is hotter based on both peak and average summer temperatures. Gobi is a cold desert with extreme variation, not extreme heat.

Now, the real drafting begins. I need to organize the explanation logically, with headings and clear comparisons and a specific mention of why.

Of course. Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which desert is hotter, followed by the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### Step 1: Define the term "Hotter"
To answer the question accurately, we need to define what "hotter" means. It can refer to several metrics:
*   **Highest recorded temperature:** The absolute peak temperature ever measured.
*   **Average summer temperature:** The typical daily high temperatures during the hottest months.
*   **Year-round average temperature:** The average temperature across all seasons.

For the purpose of this comparison, we will consider the most common interpretations: peak temperatures and average summer heat.

#### Step 2: Analyze the Climate of the Sahara Desert
*   **Location:** Spanning across North Africa.
*   **Climate Type:** The Sahara is a **hot subtropical desert**. Its low latitude means it receives intense, direct sunlight for most of the year.
*   **Key Temperature Facts:**
    *   **Record Highs:** The Sahara holds some of the highest officially recognized air temperatures on Earth. Temperatures of **55°C (131°F)** have been reliably recorded in places like Kebili, Tunisia.
    *   **Average Summer Highs:** In the hottest interior regions, average high temperatures during summer consistently range from **40°C to 47°C (104°F to 117°F)**.
    *   **Winters:** Winters are mild to warm. Freezing temperatures are rare, except at very high elevations.

#### Step 3: Analyze the Climate of the Gobi Desert
*   **Location:** Spanning across Northern China and Southern Mongolia.
*   **Climate Type:** The Gobi is a **cold desert** with a continental climate. Its high latitude and high elevation (averaging 900 to 1,500 meters or 3,000 to 5,000 feet) are critical factors.
*   **Key Temperature Facts:**
    *   **Record Highs:** Summer temperatures can be hot, occasionally reaching **40°C (104°F)** in some areas.
    *   **Average Summer Highs:** Typical summer highs are much more moderate than the Sahara's, generally ranging from **25°C to 35°C (77°F to 95°F)**.
    *   **Winters:** The Gobi is famous for its brutally cold winters. Temperatures can plummet to **-40°C (-40°F)**. This extreme cold drastically lowers its year-round average temperature.

#### Step 4: Direct Comparison
Let's compare the two deserts based on our metrics:

*   **Highest Recorded Temperature:** The **Sahara** is the clear winner, with recorded temperatures exceeding 55°C (131°F), while the Gobi's peak is around 40°C (104°F).
*   **Average Summer Temperature:** The **Sahara** is significantly hotter, with average summer highs consistently above 40°C (104°F), far exceeding the Gobi's average.
*   **Year-Round Average Temperature:** The **Sahara** is much hotter. The Gobi's extreme winter cold brings its yearly average down significantly, making it one of the coldest deserts in the world overall. The Gobi is known for its extreme *range* of temperatures, not its extreme heat.

### Final Answer

**No.**

The Sahara Desert is significantly hotter than the Gobi Desert in terms of both its record-high temperatures and its average summer temperatures. The Gobi is classified as a cold desert, primarily known for its extremely cold winters and vast temperature swings between seasons.
