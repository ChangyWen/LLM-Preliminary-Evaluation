*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this, thinking through the answer about elephant versus blue whale hearts.

First things first, I've got the user's request: is the elephant or the blue whale heart bigger? Straightforward. The requirements are clear: break down the logic step-by-step and give a definite yes/no answer.

Right off the bat, I've got some initial thoughts brewing. *Elephant*: large, land-dwelling. *Blue Whale*: colossal, the biggest animal on Earth. I seem to remember hearing something about a blue whale heart being absolutely enormous, like a car. So my gut reaction? The blue whale's heart will be far bigger. The elephant's is probably sizable, but I'm expecting the blue whale to blow it out of the water.

Okay, let's structure this. I'll need to follow a logical path.

*   **Step 1: Define the players.** African elephant versus blue whale. Gotta be specific, and using the African elephant is key because there are varying sizes.
*   **Step 2: Elephant data.** I know elephants are huge, but I need specifics. Gotta include weight and heart weight. The elephant weighs thousands of kilograms, maybe around 4000-6000 kg. My gut tells me the heart is probably in the 40-50 pound range... but I'll double check that. Aha! A quick search indicates the heart is roughly 12-21 kg (25-45 lbs). That's solid. I should toss in a relatable comparison here. Maybe the size of a large suitcase or a big bag of dog food to put it in perspective.
*   **Step 3: Blue Whale data.** This is where it gets impressive. Weight and length are crucial. These behemoths can be up to 30 meters long and weigh up to 200 *tons* (that is, ~180,000 kg!). Now, the heart... that's the money question. The car analogy is in my mind, so that's a good starting point. Searching "blue whale heart weight" gives me around 180 kg (400 lbs). Some sources claim even more. So, 180 kg sounds good to me. A solid factoid. To drive it home, I'll add the memorable comparisons. It's the size of a small car, and you could probably swim through the aorta! That really paints a picture.
*   **Step 4: Compare the data.** Time for a direct comparison, side-by-side.
    *   Elephant Heart: ~21 kg (45 lbs)
    *   Blue Whale Heart: ~180 kg (400 lbs)
    Clearly, the whale's heart is much, much bigger. Let's quantify that. The blue whale's heart is around 8-10 times heavier than the elephant's. (180/21 = 8.5). That's impactful.
*   **Step 5: Biological rationale.** Okay, why the huge difference? Body size! The blue whale is gigantic and needs a massive pump to move blood throughout its enormous frame, across vast distances. Elephants are big, sure, but they're on land and, even at their size, can't compare to the sheer scale of a whale's biology.

So, to answer the question definitively:

*   **Final Answer:** No. The blue whale, as the largest animal on Earth, has a heart that is substantially larger and heavier than an elephant's heart.
Done. Now I can go through it once more to ensure it is clear and the numbers align, the flow feels natural. The analogies help illustrate the points well. This is ready for the user.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer to your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Identify the Animals and Their Status**

*   **Elephant:** We will consider the African Bush Elephant, which is the largest living *land* animal.
*   **Blue Whale:** This is the largest living *animal on Earth*, including both land and sea creatures. This distinction is the key to the answer.

**Step 2: Analyze the Elephant's Heart**

*   An adult African elephant can weigh up to 6,000 kg (13,000 lbs).
*   To pump blood throughout this massive body, it has a very large heart.
*   **Elephant Heart Size:** The heart of an elephant weighs approximately **12 to 21 kg (25 to 45 lbs)**. It is a powerful organ, but its size is relative to the elephant's body.

**Step 3: Analyze the Blue Whale's Heart**

*   An adult blue whale can weigh up to 180,000 kg (400,000 lbs), which is about 30 times the weight of a large elephant.
*   To circulate blood through a body of this immense scale, the whale requires the largest heart in the animal kingdom.
*   **Blue Whale Heart Size:** The heart of a blue whale weighs approximately **180 kg (400 lbs)**, with some estimates going even higher. It is roughly the size of a small car (like a VW Beetle or a golf cart), and a human could crawl through its main artery, the aorta.

**Step 4: Direct Comparison**

*   **Elephant Heart Weight:** ~21 kg (~45 lbs)
*   **Blue Whale Heart Weight:** ~180 kg (~400 lbs)

Comparing the two, the blue whale's heart is roughly **8 to 10 times heavier** and significantly larger than an elephant's heart.

### Final Answer

**No.**

An elephant does not have a larger heart than a blue whale. The blue whale's heart is the largest of any animal on Earth and is substantially larger and heavier than an elephant's heart.
