*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach answering the question "Is China located east of Japan?" First, the answer: **No.** Now, let me explain my reasoning, step-by-step.

My thought process starts with breaking down the question. I need to understand what "east" means geographically. That takes me to longitude, which is how we measure east-west positions on Earth. I know longitude lines run from the North Pole to the South Pole, and the Prime Meridian, at 0 degrees longitude, acts as our reference point. Moving east from the Prime Meridian means increasing longitude values, with the International Date Line (roughly 180 degrees longitude) marking the farthest east.

Next, I'll look up the approximate longitudes of China and Japan. *Querying my internal geographical knowledge,* I find that Japan spans roughly from 122°E to 146°E. For China, the range is approximately 73°E to 135°E. Of course, these are just broad ranges across the entire countries, and individual cities would fall within those ranges.

Now comes the core of the comparison. Since longitude increases as you move east, the location with a *greater* longitude value is farther east. I can see that Japan's longitude range (122°E to 146°E) is *generally higher* than most of China's (73°E to 135°E).

**Visualizing on a Map:** Let's imagine a world map or a globe. We can easily see Asia. China is a large landmass, and Japan is a group of islands to China's right. On a typical map, "right" corresponds to "east." There's the Sea of Japan and East China Sea between them, too.

Therefore, because Japan has a generally more easterly location compared to China, I can conclude that China is located west of Japan. That also means that China is *not* located east of Japan.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Understanding Cardinal Directions:** On a global map, direction is determined by the lines of longitude. As you move from left to right on a standard map, you are moving **east**. As you move from right to left, you are moving **west**.

2.  **Locating the Countries on a Map:**
    *   Find the continent of Asia on a world map or globe.
    *   **China** is the large mainland country in East Asia.
    *   **Japan** is the island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of the Asian mainland.

3.  **Comparing Their Relative Positions:**
    *   When you look at the two countries on the map, you will see that China is on the left (the mainland) and Japan is to the right (the islands).
    *   The body of water separating them is called the Sea of Japan / East Sea and the East China Sea. To get from China to Japan, you must travel east across this water.

4.  **Using Longitude for a Technical Answer:**
    *   Longitude measures how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian. Higher "E" (East) longitude numbers are further east.
    *   The approximate longitude of mainland **China** is 73° E to 135° E.
    *   The approximate longitude of **Japan** is 122° E to 146° E.
    *   Since Japan's range of longitude is generally higher (further east) than China's, Japan is located to the east of China.

5.  **Conclusion:** The question asks if China is located east of Japan. Based on the comparison, China is located to the **west** of Japan.
