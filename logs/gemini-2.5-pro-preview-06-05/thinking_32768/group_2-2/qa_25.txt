*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is less than on the Moon. This is a straightforward question that requires a solid understanding of Newtonian gravity.

First and foremost: **No**. The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is *not* less than that on the Moon. It is greater.

Here's how I'll break this down, step-by-step:

1.  **The Foundation: Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.** Gravity's the key here, and it's governed by Newton's Law. The formula is: $F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$. Where:

    *   F is the gravitational force.
    *   G is the gravitational constant.
    *   $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects interacting.
    *   r is the distance between the centers of those objects.

2.  **Connecting Force to Acceleration (Newton's Second Law).** The user is asking about *acceleration*, and that comes from force. Newton's Second Law of Motion, $F = ma$, is the key. Now, I can relate the gravitational force to acceleration: $ma = G \frac{M m}{r^2}$. Where M is the mass of the larger object (Earth or Moon) and *m* is the mass of a smaller object. Notice that I can cancel out the little 'm' from both sides; this tells me that the acceleration due to gravity doesn't depend on the mass of the object falling. This simplifies to: $g = G \frac{M}{r^2}$. This is the *acceleration due to gravity* ($g$) equation I need to use.

3.  **Identifying the Key Variables.** Okay, in the equation $g = G \frac{M}{r^2}$, the only things that change when comparing the Earth and Moon are the mass (M) and the radius (r). The constant 'G' is... well, constant.

4.  **The Data – Let's Gather Some Numbers.** Time for some quick facts, pulled from memory, about Earth and the Moon:

    *   **Earth:** Mass (M_E) is approximately 5.97 x 10^24 kg, and the radius (r_E) is roughly 6,371 km.
    *   **Moon:** The Moon's mass (M_M) is approximately 7.34 x 10^22 kg, and its radius (r_M) is about 1,737 km.

5.  **Comparison Time: Mass and Radius.** Let's make these numbers clearer:

    *   **Mass Comparison:** The Earth is *much* more massive. To be precise, the Earth is about 81 times more massive than the Moon (5.97 x 10^24 / 7.34 x 10^22 ≈ 81).
    *   **Radius Comparison:** Earth’s radius is also larger. It’s about 3.7 times larger than the Moon's radius (6371 / 1737 ≈ 3.7).

6.  **Synthesizing the Result.** Now to see if Earth's 'g' is larger, smaller, or the same:
    *   The mass (M) is in the *numerator* of the 'g' equation. More mass means a higher value of 'g'.
    *   The radius (r) is in the *denominator*, and squared ($r^2$). A larger radius means a *lower* value of 'g'.
    *   The key: Does mass or radius have a bigger effect? The Earth is so much more massive (81 times larger) than the Moon, that it overcomes the squared radius (3.7^2 ≈ 13.7 times larger). The mass wins!

7.  **The Final Proof: Actual Values of 'g'.** Let's plug in and check our work.

    *   g_Earth ≈ 9.8 m/s²
    *   g_Moon ≈ 1.62 m/s²

    Clearly, Earth's 'g' is about 6 times greater (9.8 / 1.62 ≈ 6).

In summary: While the Moon has a smaller radius, Earth's significantly larger mass creates a much stronger gravitational field, resulting in a higher acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is, therefore, *greater* than on the Moon.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Final Answer

No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is **not** less than that on the Moon; it is significantly greater. Here is the reasoning based on the principles of physics.

**Step 1: Understand the Governing Law**

The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of a celestial body (like a planet or moon) is determined by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. The formula for this acceleration ($g$) is:

$g = G \frac{M}{r^2}$

Where:
*   $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
*   $G$ is the universal gravitational constant (it's the same everywhere in the universe).
*   $M$ is the **mass** of the celestial body (the Earth or the Moon).
*   $r$ is the **radius** of the celestial body.

**Step 2: Identify the Key Factors**

From the formula, we can see that the acceleration due to gravity depends on two main factors: the body's **mass (M)** and its **radius (r)**.

*   **Mass (M):** A more massive object will exert a stronger gravitational pull, increasing $g$.
*   **Radius (r):** Because radius is in the denominator and squared ($r^2$), a larger radius means you are farther from the center of mass, which will decrease the gravitational pull, decreasing $g$.

**Step 3: Compare the Mass and Radius of the Earth and the Moon**

Let's look at the data for the Earth and the Moon.

| Celestial Body | Mass (M) | Radius (r) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Earth** | ~5.97 x 10²⁴ kg | ~6,371 km |
| **Moon** | ~7.34 x 10²² kg | ~1,737 km |

Now, let's compare them:
*   **Mass Comparison:** The Earth is about **81 times more massive** than the Moon. This is a huge difference and will strongly increase Earth's gravity.
*   **Radius Comparison:** The Earth's radius is about **3.7 times larger** than the Moon's. This will slightly decrease Earth's gravity compared to its mass effect.

**Step 4: Determine Which Factor is More Influential**

We have a "tug-of-war": Earth's massive size (M) increases its gravity, while its larger radius (r) decreases it. However, the effect of mass is much more dominant than the effect of radius.

The 81-times-greater mass far outweighs the effect of the 3.7-times-larger radius (which is squared to become about 13.7 in the denominator). The massive increase from the mass term wins out.

**Step 5: Calculate and Compare the Final Values**

Using the formula and the values from Step 3, we get the following results for acceleration due to gravity ($g$):

*   **Acceleration due to gravity on Earth ($g_{Earth}$):** **~9.8 m/s²**
*   **Acceleration due to gravity on the Moon ($g_{Moon}$):** **~1.62 m/s²**

Comparing the two numbers, 9.8 m/s² is much larger than 1.62 m/s². In fact, Earth's surface gravity is about **6 times stronger** than the Moon's.

**Conclusion**

The statement "the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is less than that on the Moon" is incorrect. The opposite is true because Earth's vastly greater mass has a much stronger influence on its gravitational pull than its larger radius does.
