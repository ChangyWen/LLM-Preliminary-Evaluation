*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a straightforward comparison of water's boiling and melting points, explained step-by-step. My initial thought is, "Easy, the boiling point is much higher!" But, the prompt emphasizes a detailed explanation. I need to break down the entire reasoning process clearly.

First, I need to understand the core question and what's required: Define, state, compare, and then give a final answer.

Right away, I recall the basics. Melting point is 0°C (or 32°F), and boiling point is 100°C (or 212°F). So, the answer *is* no – boiling is not *lower*.

Now, to structure my response, I'll go through the definitions first: Melting is the solid-to-liquid transition; boiling is the liquid-to-gas. Gotta remember to mention standard atmospheric pressure, which is implicitly assumed here. Then, I'll state the actual values: 0°C/32°F for melting, 100°C/212°F for boiling. Comparing the numbers directly confirms my initial "No."

Next, the more interesting part – explaining *why*. This is where I can add real value. I’ll briefly talk about the states of matter and energy. More energy is required to go from liquid to gas, and boiling is that transition. I'll relate this to what's happening at a molecular level: Ice molecules are held together, water molecules can move a bit, and steam molecules have enough energy to escape. It's like a staircase of energy: melting is the first step, boiling is the second.

Finally, I'll give the direct "No" answer again, followed by a brief summary of the reasoning. The numbers back this up. Boiling needs more energy. That's it, crystal clear.

Before sending it, I should check: Is it clear, logical, and direct? Does it answer all the questions? Definitions, values, comparison, molecular explanation, final answer – check, check, check. Seems ready to go.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Define the "Melting Point of Ice"**

The melting point is the specific temperature at which a substance changes its state from a solid to a liquid. For water, this is the temperature at which solid ice turns into liquid water.

*   At standard atmospheric pressure, the melting point of ice is **0° Celsius (32° Fahrenheit)**.

**Step 2: Define the "Boiling Point of Water"**

The boiling point is the specific temperature at which a substance changes its state from a liquid to a gas (or vapor). For water, this is the temperature at which liquid water turns into steam.

*   At standard atmospheric pressure, the boiling point of water is **100° Celsius (212° Fahrenheit)**.

**Step 3: Compare the Two Temperatures**

Now, let's compare the values we have defined.

*   **Using the Celsius scale:** Is 100°C lower than 0°C? No, 100 is a much higher number than 0.
*   **Using the Fahrenheit scale:** Is 212°F lower than 32°F? No, 212 is a much higher number than 32.

**Step 4: Explain the Physical Process**

The states of matter (solid, liquid, gas) are determined by the amount of energy the molecules have.

1.  **Ice (Solid):** Molecules are locked in a fixed structure and have low energy.
2.  **Melting:** To break this structure and allow molecules to slide past each other (become a liquid), you must add energy in the form of heat. This happens at the melting point (0°C / 32°F).
3.  **Boiling:** To make the liquid molecules move so fast that they completely break free from each other and escape as a gas, you must add a great deal *more* energy. This requires reaching a much higher temperature, the boiling point (100°C / 212°F).

Therefore, you must first melt ice into water before you can heat that water up to its boiling point. The boiling point is necessarily higher than the melting point.

### Final Answer

**No.**

The boiling point of water (100°C / 212°F) is significantly **higher** than the melting point of ice (0°C / 32°F).
