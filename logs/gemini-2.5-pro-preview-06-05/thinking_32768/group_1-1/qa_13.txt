*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's what I'm thinking. The core question is simple: is Garnavillo, IA east of Newellton, LA? Okay, straight away, I recognize this is a longitude problem. To figure this out, I need the longitude of both locations. Longitude, as we know, measures east-west position; higher (less negative) values are further east in this hemisphere. Both locations are in the Western Hemisphere, so we're dealing with negative longitudes.

First, I need the coordinates for Garnavillo, IA. Let's search for that... Okay, looks like we're at approximately 42.86° N latitude and a longitude of -91.23° W. Next, Newellton, LA. Alright, coordinates are about 32.07° N and a longitude of -91.24° W.

Now, let's compare. Garnavillo: -91.23° W. Newellton: -91.24° W. On a number line, -91.23 is greater than -91.24. Since we're in the Western Hemisphere, that means Garnavillo is east of Newellton. So, the logic here is sound.

To break it down for someone else, I'd state the objective: to compare the east-west positions. We need the longitude values, which determine the locations' east-west positioning. Then, provide the longitude for Garnavillo (-91.23° W) and Newellton (-91.24° W). Since a less negative (greater) longitude is further east, we know Garnavillo is east of Newellton.

The final answer is clear: Yes. Everything checks out, all the way from the initial question, the determination of the methodology, to the final solution, and a logical reasoning. It's a complete and accurate analysis.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the Goal:** The goal is to determine if Garnavillo, Iowa is located to the east of Newellton, Louisiana.
2.  **Determine the Method:** To find the east-west relationship between two places, we need to compare their longitudes. Longitude lines run north-south and measure how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian.
3.  **Find the Longitude of Garnavillo, IA:** The approximate longitude for Garnavillo, Iowa is **91.23° West**.
4.  **Find the Longitude of Newellton, LA:** The approximate longitude for Newellton, Louisiana is **91.24° West**.
5.  **Compare the Longitudes:**
    *   Garnavillo, IA: 91.23° W
    *   Newellton, LA: 91.24° W

    When comparing longitudes in the Western Hemisphere, the location with the *smaller* numerical value is further to the east (closer to the Prime Meridian).
6.  **Conclusion:** Since 91.23 is a smaller number than 91.24, Garnavillo, IA is located slightly to the east of Newellton, LA.
