*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if Pragser Wildsee is west of Lake Vico. It's straightforward, but I'll need to be precise in my reasoning and deliver a definitive "Yes" or "No".

First, I need to understand the scope of the question. It's a geographical comparison, so I'll need to know the relative positions of these two lakes.

*   **Entity 1: Pragser Wildsee (Lago di Braies)** - I'm familiar with this one; it's a stunning lake in the Dolomites, the mountain range in the far north of Italy.
*   **Entity 2: Lake Vico (Lago di Vico)** - I know this is a volcanic lake in central Italy, near Rome, in the Lazio region.

The question is: Is Pragser Wildsee *west* of Lake Vico? I know that Italy is a peninsula extending from north to south, and the west is left and east is right on a map. To be more precise, I'll need to pinpoint their locations.

Here's how I'll approach this:

1.  **Locate Pragser Wildsee:** I know it's in South Tyrol (Alto Adige) in the Dolomites. A quick search to verify its location: approximately 46.7° N, 12.1° E.
2.  **Locate Lake Vico:** I know it's in Lazio. A quick search to confirm its location: approximately 42.3° N, 12.2° E.
3.  **Compare Locations:**
    *   Pragser Wildsee: ~46.7° N, **12.1° E**.
    *   Lake Vico: ~42.3° N, **12.2° E**.
4.  **Determine Relative Direction:** Longitude determines east-west position. Since Pragser Wildsee is at 12.1° E and Lake Vico is at 12.2° E, Pragser Wildsee has a lower longitude. Therefore, Pragser Wildsee is west of Lake Vico. It is also further north, but the question specifically focuses on east-west.

So, the reasoning is sound, and I've isolated the data to compare the longitudes.

**Final Answer: Yes.**

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the relative location of the two lakes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the location of Pragser Wildsee (Lago di Braies).**
    *   Pragser Wildsee is a famous alpine lake located in the Dolomites mountain range.
    *   Geographically, it is in the province of South Tyrol in Northern Italy.
    *   Its approximate longitude is **12.08° E**.

2.  **Identify the location of Lake Vico (Lago di Vico).**
    *   Lake Vico is a volcanic crater lake located in the Cimini Hills.
    *   Geographically, it is in the province of Viterbo, in the Lazio region of Central Italy.
    *   Its approximate longitude is **12.17° E**.

3.  **Compare the longitudes.**
    *   To determine if one location is west of another, we compare their longitudes. A location with a smaller (less positive) longitude is to the west of a location with a larger (more positive) longitude.
    *   Pragser Wildsee's longitude is ~12.08° E.
    *   Lake Vico's longitude is ~12.17° E.
    *   Since 12.08 is less than 12.17, Pragser Wildsee is located to the west of Lake Vico.
