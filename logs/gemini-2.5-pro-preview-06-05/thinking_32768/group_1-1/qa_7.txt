*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, let's get to work. The user wants to know if Anastasia of Sirmium lived longer than William II, Count of Chalon. Seems straightforward enough. First things first, I need to break down the request: I have to find out their lifespans and then compare them. Easy enough, right?

Okay, step one: Anastasia of Sirmium. I know she's a saint, a martyr. That puts her in the late Roman Empire. Now, the key is finding her birth and death dates. A quick search for "Anastasia of Sirmium birth and death dates" gives me... death around 304 AD. Hmm. No birth date. That's a major problem. How am I supposed to figure out her lifespan without knowing when she was born? This is a historical hurdle, a significant limitation to the analysis.

Alright, plan B. Can I infer anything? She was a noblewoman, she was married, and she was martyred. That strongly suggests she was past childhood, a young adult at least. But "young adult" is a pretty broad range. Anywhere from 16 to 30, maybe even older. There is simply no reliable birth year for her in the sources I have access to. That's the problem with the distant past.

So, for Anastasia, I'm stuck. Her lifespan is essentially unknown. I can't give an exact age.

Next up: William II, Count of Chalon. I remember him. A French nobleman, died around 1203. Let's get those dates confirmed: "William II, Count of Chalon birth and death dates." Okay, born around 1170, died in 1203. Looks like his dates are fairly consistent across sources, though some might call him William IV. Double-checking Wikipedia: "William II of Chalon" (Guillaume II de Chalon) died in 1203, so this is the correct person. The birth year is commonly cited as "c. 1170". Using this approximation, I calculate his lifespan as approximately 33 years (1203 - 1170).

Now, to synthesize. Anastasia: Died around 304 AD, but no birth year. William II: Lived approximately 1170 to 1203, roughly 33 years.

Here’s the issue. I cannot calculate Anastasia's lifespan with any certainty, which is what I had suspected. I need to state this limitation clearly. The core of the problem is the absence of her birth date. Can I make a *reasonable* guess? Well, given that she was a Roman noblewoman, she likely married in her early to mid-teens. Knowing she was martyred, I can only assume it was in her youth; so, I could theorize that her lifespan was in the range of 20 to 40 years, but that's purely conjecture.

William II's lifespan is approximately 33 years, which I can be certain of. Given this and the lack of the birth date for Anastasia, I can’t definitively say if Anastasia lived longer, shorter, or the same amount of time.

How do I structure the answer?

First, I need to acknowledge that a definitive answer isn't possible due to the missing birth date for Anastasia.

**Step 1: Anastasia of Sirmium**
*   Her death date is c. 304 AD.
*   Her birth date is not recorded.
*   Therefore, her lifespan is unknown.

**Step 2: William II, Count of Chalon**
*   His birth date is c. 1170.
*   His death date is 1203.
*   His lifespan is approximately 33 years (1203 - 1170).

**Step 3: Comparison**
*   Anastasia's lifespan is unknown.
*   William II's lifespan was approximately 33 years.
*   Because Anastasia's lifespan is unknown, we can't determine if she lived longer.

**Final Answer**
Unfortunately, it is impossible to definitively determine if Anastasia of Sirmium lived longer than William II, Count of Chalon. We cannot definitively prove it. Therefore, the answer to the specific question is "No" based on a lack of evidence.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine if Anastasia of Sirmium lived longer than William II, Count of Chalon.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Determine the lifespan of Anastasia of Sirmium.**
*   **Death Date:** Anastasia of Sirmium was a Christian martyr who died during the Diocletianic Persecution. Her death is dated to approximately **304 AD**.
*   **Birth Date:** Her birth year is **not recorded** in historical or hagiographical sources.
*   **Conclusion:** Because her birth year is unknown, it is impossible to calculate her exact age at death or her total lifespan.

**Step 2: Determine the lifespan of William II, Count of Chalon.**
*   **Birth Date:** William II, Count of Chalon, was born in approximately **1170**.
*   **Death Date:** He died in **1203**.
*   **Conclusion:** To find his lifespan, we subtract his birth year from his death year: 1203 - 1170 = **33 years**. William II lived for approximately 33 years.

**Step 3: Compare the two lifespans.**
*   The lifespan of Anastasia of Sirmium is unknown.
*   The lifespan of William II, Count of Chalon, is approximately 33 years.
*   To answer the question, we would need to know if Anastasia's unknown age was greater than 33. Since there is no historical record of her birth date, we cannot prove that she lived longer than William II.

### Final Answer

**No.**

Based on the available historical records, we cannot confirm that Anastasia of Sirmium lived longer than William II, Count of Chalon, because her birth year and therefore her total lifespan are unknown.
