*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, let's tackle this. The question is straightforward: is ZIP code 98580 in Washington west of ZIP code 97233 in Oregon?

First, I need to break this down. It's about geographic location, specifically east-west positioning. That means I need to use longitude. The plan is simple: I'll find the approximate longitude for each ZIP code, compare them, and then I'll provide a clear "yes" or "no" answer along with the reasoning.

Here's the execution:

*   **Step 1: Identify the locations.**  I need to know the general area associated with each ZIP code. A quick lookup reveals:
    *   98580 is associated with **Tenino, Washington**.
    *   97233 is associated with a portion of **Portland, Oregon**.

*   **Step 2: Determine the longitudes.**  This is the key. I need the longitude of Tenino and Portland. A quick search for coordinates for those locations gives me these approximate values:
    *   Tenino, WA (98580): Approximately 46.85° N, **-122.85° W**
    *   Portland, OR (97233): Approximately 45.52° N, **-122.55° W**

*   **Step 3: Compare the longitudes.**  Remember, longitude tells us how far east or west a location is. A larger number in *degrees West* (or, a *more negative* number) means a location is further west.
    *   Tenino, WA: -122.85° W
    *   Portland, OR: -122.55° W
    *   -122.85 is indeed a larger value than -122.55 (meaning, it's further west).

*   **Step 4: Draw the conclusion.** Based on the comparison of their longitudes, because -122.85° W is west of -122.55° W, we can conclude that the location of ZIP code 98580 is west of the location of ZIP code 97233.

**Final Answer: Yes.**

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the Location of Each ZIP Code:**
    *   **98580, WA:** This ZIP code corresponds to the city of **Tenino, Washington**, and the surrounding area.
    *   **97233, OR:** This ZIP code corresponds to a neighborhood in **eastern Portland, Oregon**.

2.  **Determine the Longitude of Each Location:** To determine if one place is west of another, we need to compare their longitudes. Longitude lines run north-south and measure how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian. A more westerly location will have a larger West longitude value (e.g., 123° W is west of 122° W).
    *   The approximate longitude for the center of **Tenino, WA (98580)** is **-122.85° W**.
    *   The approximate longitude for the center of **eastern Portland, OR (97233)** is **-122.55° W**.

3.  **Compare the Longitudes:**
    *   Tenino's longitude is -122.85°.
    *   Portland's longitude is -122.55°.
    *   Since -122.85 is a more negative number than -122.55, it is located further to the west.

### Final Answer

**Yes**, 98580, WA is located west of 97233, OR.
