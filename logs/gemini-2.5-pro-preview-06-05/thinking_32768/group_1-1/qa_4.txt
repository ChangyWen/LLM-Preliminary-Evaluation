*********************************** End of Inputs **************************************




*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if Williamsburg, Manhattan, is south of Hillman Houses, Manhattan. My first thought is, *wait a minute, is Williamsburg even in Manhattan?* This sounds like a classic geographic misunderstanding.

Here's how I'll approach this: First, I need to confirm the locations. I know Hillman Houses. It's a housing cooperative in the Lower East Side, so let me just quickly double-check the specifics. Yep, Grand Street, Lower East Side, easy enough. The key streets help to triangulate this.

Now, Williamsburg. Okay, this is where the problem lies. Williamsburg is *not* in Manhattan. It's a very well-known neighborhood, but it's in Brooklyn. The user's premise has a fundamental flaw. I can't just say "Yes" or "No" because the very foundation of the question is incorrect.

So, here's the breakdown:

1.  **Hillman Houses:** Located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, specifically around Grand Street.

2.  **Williamsburg:** Williamsburg is *not* in Manhattan. It is located in the borough of Brooklyn.

3.  **Addressing the question:** Because the user stated "Williamsburg, Manhattan," which is inaccurate, the original question is based on incorrect information.

4.  **Comparing Actual Locations:** If we compare the actual locations, we see that Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is east of the Lower East Side of Manhattan. It's across the East River. Latitude-wise, they're roughly at the same level, perhaps the southern part of Williamsburg is slightly south of Hillman Houses, but the main directional relationship is east-west.

5.  **Conclusion:** Since Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan, the user's question is based on a false premise.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Final Answer: No.**

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the location of Hillman Houses.** The Hillman Houses cooperative is a real location in Manhattan. It is situated in the Lower East Side neighborhood, specifically on Grand Street between Lewis Street and Abraham E. Kazan Street.

2.  **Identify the location of "Williamsburg, Manhattan".** This is the critical step. The neighborhood of Williamsburg is located in the borough of **Brooklyn**, not Manhattan. It lies across the East River from the Lower East Side of Manhattan. There is no neighborhood named Williamsburg in Manhattan.

3.  **Analyze the premise of the question.** The question "Is WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan located south of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan?" is based on a false premise, as a "Williamsburg, Manhattan" does not exist.

4.  **Compare the actual locations.** To answer the spirit of your question, we can compare the location of Hillman Houses (Manhattan) to Williamsburg (Brooklyn). Hillman Houses is in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Williamsburg, Brooklyn is located directly to the **east** of the Lower East Side, across the East River. They are at a roughly similar latitude, not one directly north or south of the other.

### Final Answer

**No.**

The neighborhood of Williamsburg is located in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Therefore, "Williamsburg, Manhattan" does not exist. The actual neighborhood of Williamsburg, Brooklyn is located to the **east** of Hillman Houses, across the East River, not south of it.
