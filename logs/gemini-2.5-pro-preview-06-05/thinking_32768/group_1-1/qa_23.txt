Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if Pine Flat Dam in California is east of St. Mary's Church in Nevada. Alright, I need to break this down. My goal is to give a clear "Yes" or "No" answer, along with a step-by-step explanation of how I got there.

First, I need to get the geographical coordinates – latitude and longitude – for both locations. Finding the longitude will be key. For Pine Flat Dam, I'll search "Pine Flat Dam, California coordinates". For St. Mary's Church, I'll search "St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, Virginia City, Nevada coordinates" – I know that church is in Virginia City.

Alright, let's see... After a quick search: Pine Flat Dam is roughly at 119.32° West longitude, and St. Mary's is around 119.65° West longitude.

Now, I need to remember how longitude works. East/West is determined by longitude. In the Western Hemisphere, smaller numbers mean you're further east. Think of it like this: -119° West is east of -120° West.

So, comparing the longitudes: Pine Flat Dam is at 119.32° W, and St. Mary’s is at 119.65° W. 119.32 is a smaller number than 119.65.

Therefore, 119.32° W is further east than 119.65° W. Pine Flat Dam is east of St. Mary’s Church!

Now, to provide a good response I should structure it this way:

**Yes.**

**Step 1: Identify Locations and Coordinates**

*   Pine Flat Dam, CA is located at approximately 119.32° West longitude.
*   St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV is located at approximately 119.65° West longitude.

**Step 2: Explain East/West Position**

*   East/West position is determined by longitude.
*   In the Western Hemisphere, a smaller longitude number indicates a location further east.

**Step 3: Compare Longitudes**

*   Pine Flat Dam: 119.32° W
*   St. Mary's Church: 119.65° W
*   119.32 is a smaller number than 119.65.

**Step 4: State the Conclusion**

*   Based on the comparison of longitudes, Pine Flat Dam, CA is east of St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV.

Sounds good! Now I need to review it, make sure it is all clear, and meets the user's request. The logic's solid, the explanation is correct, and the answer is perfectly clear. Excellent.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Find the geographic coordinates (specifically the longitude) of each location.**

*   **Pine Flat Dam, CA:** This dam is located on the Kings River in Fresno County, California. Its approximate longitude is **119.32° West**.
*   **St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV:** This historic church is located in Virginia City, Nevada. Its approximate longitude is **119.65° West**.

**Step 2: Understand how longitude determines east-west positioning.**

Longitude lines run north-south across the globe. When comparing two locations in the Western Hemisphere (where longitude is measured in degrees West), the location with the **smaller** longitude number is farther **east**.

**Step 3: Compare the longitudes of the two locations.**

*   Pine Flat Dam's longitude: **119.32° W**
*   St. Mary's Church's longitude: **119.65° W**

Comparing the numbers, 119.32 is smaller than 119.65.

**Step 4: Draw the conclusion.**

Since Pine Flat Dam has a smaller West longitude value than St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, it is located to the east of the church.

### Final Answer

**Yes.**
