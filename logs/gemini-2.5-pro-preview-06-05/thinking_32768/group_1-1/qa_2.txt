*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here’s what I’m thinking. First, I need to figure out the core question: Did Coetzee's *Summertime* come out *after* Collins’s *Catching Fire*? Got it.

Okay, let's break this down.  To answer the question, I need specific release dates.  I need to find out when *Summertime* was published and when *Catching Fire* was published. Simple enough.

Now for the search strategy. I'll use precise search queries to find the dates. I’ll start with "J.M. Coetzee Summertime release date" and "Suzanne Collins Catching Fire release date".  I expect to find these dates fairly quickly.

Let's get to work. First up, "J.M. Coetzee Summertime release date".  Knowing Coetzee, I suspect it'll be published by a reputable publisher, so I'll look at a range of sources for the details.  August 2009 in Australia seems to be the earliest, with a September 2009 release in the UK. I'll double check using sites like Wikipedia or official publisher information to be absolutely sure.  Okay, August 2009 for Australia, September 2009 for the UK.

Now for "Suzanne Collins Catching Fire release date." I anticipate this being widely available, and it is.  September 1, 2009.  Easy.

Time to put it all together. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

**Step 1: Find the release date of J. M. Coetzee’s *Summertime*.** My research indicates August 2009 (Australia) and September 2009 (UK).

**Step 2: Find the release date of Suzanne Collins’s *Catching Fire*.** My search results show a release date of September 1, 2009.

**Step 3: Compare the two release dates.** *Summertime* came out in August 2009. *Catching Fire* came out September 1, 2009. August is *before* September 1st.

And finally, the answer:  The question is, “Was *Summertime* released *later than* *Catching Fire*?” Given the information, *Summertime* was released *earlier* than *Catching Fire*. Therefore, the answer is "No".

I've double-checked my sources and the logic is sound. The answer is clear and directly addresses the question. Done.
