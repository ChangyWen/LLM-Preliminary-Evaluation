*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's see... the user wants to know if "The Ort Institute, IL" is west of "University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI". Simple enough on the surface, but I need to break this down logically. First, I need to figure out the *exact* question – they want a step-by-step process and a "Yes" or "No" answer. Right.

So, Entity 1 is "The Ort Institute, IL" and Entity 2 is "University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI." The relationship being tested is whether Entity 1 is *west* of Entity 2. Okay, I get it. I'll provide the step-by-step explanation, then the definitive "Yes" or "No".

Now, time to get the geographical data. I need the latitude and longitude for both. For "The Ort Institute, IL," a quick search shows "ORT Chicago" or "Zarem/Golde ORT Technical Institute" and that the main campus is in Skokie, IL. Searching "ORT Technical Institute Skokie IL coordinates" should give me what I need. I get approximately 42.03° N, 87.74° W. I'll use Skokie as the representative location.

Next, "University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI". Ah, yes, that's now called the "University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, Sheboygan Campus." Gotta make sure I get the updated name but I know the physical place is the same. "University of Wisconsin Sheboygan coordinates". Found it – approximately 43.73° N, 87.75° W.

Alright, let's analyze those coordinates. Ort Institute (Skokie, IL): ~42.03° N, 87.74° W. UW-Sheboygan (Sheboygan, WI): ~43.73° N, 87.75° W.

Now, the crucial part is the east-west determination, using longitude. Longitude tells us how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian. In the Western Hemisphere, the smaller the longitude number (closer to 0), the *more east* a location is. Conversely, a *larger* longitude number signifies a location *farther west*.

Let's compare the longitudes: Ort Institute is ~87.74° W, and UW-Sheboygan is ~87.75° W. The key question is "Is 87.74° W west of 87.75° W?". No, because 87.74 is smaller than 87.75, making the Ort Institute more east.

Time to organize this into a clear, step-by-step reasoning.

*   **Step 1:** Define the locations. Location A: The Ort Institute, IL (represented by the Skokie, IL campus). Location B: University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI.
*   **Step 2:** Get their longitudes. For Ort Institute, it's approximately 87.74° West. For UW-Sheboygan, it's approximately 87.75° West.
*   **Step 3:** Compare. Since 87.74 is a smaller number than 87.75, The Ort Institute is located *east* of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan.

Okay, and the final answer? Based on this, the answer is "No."

Let me quickly review... The steps are logical, the explanation of longitude is clear. The comparison is correct, and the final answer is directly linked to the user's original question. The approximation of the coordinates is fine for the difference we need to ascertain. The Ort Institute is not west of UW-Sheboygan; it's slightly east. Therefore, the answer is precisely "No." Excellent.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the two locations:**
    *   **Location A:** The Ort Institute, IL (specifically, the Zarem/Golde ORT Technical Institute in Skokie, Illinois).
    *   **Location B:** University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI (now known as the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, Sheboygan Campus).

2.  **Determine the longitude of each location.** Longitude lines measure how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian. In the Western Hemisphere, a larger longitude number means the location is farther west.
    *   The approximate longitude of **The Ort Institute** in Skokie, IL is **87.74° W**.
    *   The approximate longitude of the **University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan** is **87.75° W**.

3.  **Compare the longitudes.**
    *   The Ort Institute's longitude is 87.74° W.
    *   UW-Sheboygan's longitude is 87.75° W.
    *   Since 87.74 is a smaller number than 87.75, The Ort Institute is located slightly **east** of the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan.

### Final Answer

No
