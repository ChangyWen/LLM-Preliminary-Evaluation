*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, let's see... the question is straightforward: Was Yao Shu born earlier than Alfonso of Molina? My mind immediately goes to comparing their birth years. That's the crux of it.

First, let's pull the relevant data.

**Step 1: Find the birth year of Yao Shu.** I'll consult my knowledge base. *Searching...* Ah, yes: Yao Shu (姚樞), born in 1203, died in 1280. Got it.

**Step 2: Now, let's find the birth year of Alfonso of Molina.** Again, I'll consult the database. *Searching...* Okay, Alfonso of Molina (Infante Alfonso of Castile, Lord of Molina), born in 1202, died in 1272. Perfect.

**Step 3: Comparison Time!**

*   Yao Shu: Born 1203.
*   Alfonso of Molina: Born 1202.

**Step 4: Logic Check:** To determine who was born earlier, we compare the birth years. 1202 comes before 1203.

**Step 5: Conclusion.** Since Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202 and Yao Shu in 1203, Alfonso was born earlier. Therefore, the answer to the initial question is...

No.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine who was born earlier.

### Step-by-step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the birth year of Yao Shu.**
    Yao Shu (姚樞), a Confucian scholar and official who advised Kublai Khan, was born in the year **1203**.

2.  **Identify the birth year of Alfonso of Molina.**
    Alfonso of Molina (Infante Alfonso of Castile, Lord of Molina), a Spanish nobleman, was born in the year **1202**.

3.  **Compare the two birth years.**
    To find out who was born earlier, we compare their birth years:
    *   Yao Shu's birth year: 1203
    *   Alfonso of Molina's birth year: 1202

    The year 1202 comes before the year 1203. Therefore, Alfonso of Molina was born one year earlier than Yao Shu.

### Final Answer

No.
