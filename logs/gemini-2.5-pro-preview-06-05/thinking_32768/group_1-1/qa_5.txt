*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the Red Balloon Learning Center in Manhattan is east of the Hunters Point South Park Playground in Queens. Simple enough. My expertise in urban geography and quick spatial reasoning skills should make this a breeze.

First, I need to get some hard data. I'll need addresses. "Red Balloon Learning Center, Manhattan address" - a quick search will get me that. Okay, it's at 202 W 95th St, New York, NY 10025. Got it. Now for the playground: "HUNTERS POINT S PARK PLAYGROUND, Queens address". Right, it's within Hunters Point South Park, which is at Center Blvd, Long Island City, NY 11101. Excellent.

Now the fun part - reasoning. Step 1: pinpoint the Red Balloon Learning Center. It's on 95th Street, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Step 2: locate the playground. It's in Long Island City, Queens, right on the East River. Okay. Step 3: compare the locations. Aha! Manhattan is west of Queens, and they are separated by the East River. Therefore, the Red Balloon Learning Center is *west* of the playground. The question asks if it's east, which is the opposite. The answer, therefore, has to be "No".

Iâ€™ll structure the answer clearly: first the addresses, then my geographical reasoning, and then a firm "No" at the end. This should be a clean, concise response, and the user should be completely satisfied.
