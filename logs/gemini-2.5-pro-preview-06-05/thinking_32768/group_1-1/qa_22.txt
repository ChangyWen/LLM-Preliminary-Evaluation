*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if Lake Martin, Alabama, is south of the Dal-Tex Building in Texas. Straightforward enough, but it's going to require some methodical geo-spatial analysis.

First, I need to understand the task. They want a step-by-step explanation *and* a definitive "Yes" or "No" answer. So, that's my framework.

Next, I need to define my "objects" and the relationship they're asking about. Object 1 is Lake Martin, Alabama. Object 2 is the Dal-Tex Building, Texas. The core question is about their relative north-south positioning: is Lake Martin south of the Dal-Tex Building?

Now, how do I actually figure this out? Coordinates are key here. I need the latitudes of both locations. Let's start with Lake Martin. I know it's in Alabama. Let's quickly access my internal knowledge base... "Lake Martin, Alabama"... right, it's a reservoir. I'll grab a central point; approximately 32.7 degrees North latitude.  Let me be more precise: 32.73° N, 85.90° W.

Moving on to the Dal-Tex Building. I know it's in Dallas, Texas. It's historically significant. Let's locate it precisely: 501 Elm Street, Dallas, TX. I'll retrieve those coordinates... approximately 32.78 degrees North latitude. More precisely: 32.7801° N, 96.8084° W.

Now the fun part: the comparison.  I need to explicitly lay out the reasoning in a logical sequence.

1.  First, let's find the location and latitude of Lake Martin. 32.73° N.
2.  Next, we find the location and latitude of the Dal-Tex Building. 32.78° N.
3.  Then I'll make sure to explain *why* this comparison matters. Latitude indicates North/South position. Higher latitude means farther North, in the Northern Hemisphere.
4.  Then, the crux of the reasoning, clearly stating the comparison result: Lake Martin's latitude (32.73° N) is a *smaller* number than the Dal-Tex Building's (32.78° N).
5.  Finally, I can state the conclusion: Because Lake Martin has a lower latitude, it *is* south of the Dal-Tex Building.

Okay, let's construct that final answer precisely. The steps must be clearly delineated.

**Step 1:** First, we need to determine the geographic coordinates (specifically the latitude) of Lake Martin, Alabama. The coordinates are approximately 32.73° N.

**Step 2:** Next, we determine the geographic coordinates of the Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, Texas. The coordinates are approximately 32.78° N.

**Step 3:** Now, we compare the two latitudes. Latitude measures a location's north-south position on Earth. In the Northern Hemisphere, a higher latitude number means a location is farther north.

**Step 4:** Comparing the two, Lake Martin's latitude (~32.73° N) is a smaller number than the Dal-Tex Building's latitude (~32.78° N).

**Step 5:** Therefore, because it has a lower latitude, Lake Martin is located south of the Dal-Tex Building.

Final Answer: Yes.

Done. I've provided the step-by-step reasoning, accurate information, and the final, requested answer. Time to review the output to ensure clarity and precision before moving on to the next query.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the location of Lake Martin, AL:** Lake Martin is a large reservoir located in Central Alabama. Its approximate central latitude is **32.73° N**.

2.  **Identify the location of the Dal-Tex Building, TX:** The Dal-Tex Building is located at 501 Elm Street in Dallas, Texas. Its approximate latitude is **32.78° N**.

3.  **Compare the latitudes:** Latitude measures how far north or south a location is from the Equator. In the Northern Hemisphere, a location with a higher latitude number is farther north, and a location with a lower latitude number is farther south.

4.  **Conclusion:**
    *   Lake Martin's latitude is ~32.73° N.
    *   The Dal-Tex Building's latitude is ~32.78° N.

    Since 32.73 is a smaller number than 32.78, Lake Martin, AL is located south of the Dal-Tex Building, TX.
