*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's what I'm thinking. The question is, plain and simple: is Newellton, LA east of Garnavillo, IA? Okay, let's break this down methodically.

First things first, I need to get a handle on the spatial relationship. The obvious route is to compare their longitudes. That’s the key. Longitude tells us their east-west positioning. Remember, on the Earth, a smaller (less negative, in this case, since both are in the Western Hemisphere) longitude means you're further east. A larger negative number means further west.

Next step: find those coordinates. I'll quickly search for Newellton, Louisiana. Looks like its longitude is approximately -91.24° West. Now, Garnavillo, Iowa. Let me pull that up... -91.23° West. Got it.

Now, the comparison. Newellton is at -91.24° W, and Garnavillo is at -91.23° W. Since we're dealing with negative longitudes (both in the Western Hemisphere), the location with the *less* negative value is further east.

Let's formalize the steps for clarity. Step 1: Define the objective – determine the east-west relationship via longitudes. Step 2: Newellton's longitude, -91.24° W. Step 3: Garnavillo's longitude, -91.23° W. Step 4: Compare; -91.23° is less negative than -91.24°. Step 5: Conclusion: Newellton is west of Garnavillo.

So, I'm essentially done. The question: Is Newellton east of Garnavillo? The answer, based on the longitude comparison, is a resounding no. My reasoning is solid; the steps are clear. Yes, I can confidently say that Newellton, LA is not east of Garnavillo, IA. All looks good.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the Goal:** The goal is to determine if Newellton, Louisiana, is located to the east of Garnavillo, Iowa. To do this, we need to compare their longitudes. Longitude is the geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface.

2.  **Find the Longitude of Newellton, LA:** The approximate longitude for Newellton, Louisiana, is **-91.24° W**.

3.  **Find the Longitude of Garnavillo, IA:** The approximate longitude for Garnavillo, Iowa, is **-91.23° W**.

4.  **Compare the Longitudes:**
    *   Newellton, LA: -91.24°
    *   Garnavillo, IA: -91.23°

    In the Western Hemisphere (where both locations are), a location with a less negative longitude (a number closer to 0) is further east. Since -91.23 is less negative than -91.24, Garnavillo, IA is located slightly east of Newellton, LA.

5.  **Conclusion:** Because Newellton's longitude (-91.24°) is more negative than Garnavillo's (-91.23°), Newellton is located to the **west** of Garnavillo.
