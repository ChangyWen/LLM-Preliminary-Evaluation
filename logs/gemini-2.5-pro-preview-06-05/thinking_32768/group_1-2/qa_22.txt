*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's see... the question is: Is the Dal-Tex Building in Texas south of Lake Martin in Alabama? Right, this is a straightforward geographic problem. My thought process is:

First, I need to break this down. It's about comparing the *locations* of two things: the Dal-Tex Building and Lake Martin. The relationship I'm looking for is whether the Dal-Tex Building is south of Lake Martin.

To do that, I'll need to figure out their *latitudes*. Latitude is key here. Something is south of something else when its latitude value is *lower*.

I already know a bit about both. The Dal-Tex Building... ah, yes, that's a prominent historical building in Dallas, Texas. I need to pin down its coordinates. A quick search... confirmed: 501 Elm St, Dallas, TX 75202. Now, what's the approximate latitude for Dallas? Ah, about 32.78° N. Got it.

Next, Lake Martin. I know it's a sizable reservoir in Alabama. Location... East Central Alabama, near Alexander City. I need its latitude. Another quick search... approximately 32.68° N. Alright, I've got the latitudes.

Now comes the comparison. I need to see if the Dal-Tex Building's latitude is lower than Lake Martin's. Essentially, is 32.78° N *less than* 32.68° N?

Well, no. 32.78 is definitely *greater than* 32.68.

Therefore, since the Dal-Tex Building's latitude is *higher* than Lake Martin's, the Dal-Tex Building is actually north of Lake Martin.

Here's how I'd present that for a clear and definitive answer:

**No.**

*   **Step 1: The Dal-Tex Building is in Dallas, Texas.** Its approximate latitude is 32.78° N.
*   **Step 2: Lake Martin is located in central Alabama.** Its approximate latitude is 32.68° N.
*   **Step 3: In the Northern Hemisphere, a location is south of another if it has a lower latitude value.**
*   **Step 4: Comparing the latitudes, the Dal-Tex Building (32.78° N) has a higher latitude than Lake Martin (32.68° N).**
*   **Step 5: Consequently, the Dal-Tex Building is north of Lake Martin.**

So, the Dal-Tex Building is *not* south of Lake Martin.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the location of the Dal-Tex Building, TX.**
    The Dal-Tex Building is located at 501 Elm Street in Dallas, Texas. The approximate latitude for Dallas is **32.78° N**.

2.  **Identify the location of Lake Martin, AL.**
    Lake Martin is a large reservoir located in East Central Alabama. The approximate latitude for the center of Lake Martin is **32.68° N**.

3.  **Compare the latitudes.**
    To determine if one location is south of another in the Northern Hemisphere, we compare their latitudes. A location with a *lower* latitude number is further south.
    *   Dal-Tex Building (Dallas, TX): **32.78° N**
    *   Lake Martin (Alabama): **32.68° N**

4.  **Conclusion.**
    The latitude of the Dal-Tex Building (32.78°) is *higher* than the latitude of Lake Martin (32.68°). Therefore, the Dal-Tex Building is located **north** of Lake Martin.
