Alright, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is west of The Ort Institute.  Seems straightforward enough.  I need a step-by-step breakdown to make sure my answer is bulletproof, and of course, a definitive "Yes" or "No" at the end.  

First things first, I need to clarify what we are talking about. We have two entities: UW-Sheboygan, which is a location I know, and The Ort Institute, which I've heard of. I'll need their locations. The core of this question is geographical: "is one location *west of* the other?". I know the answer will hinge on the longitude of each place.

Okay, let's gather the facts.  Step 1: Find the locations and their coordinates.  I quickly realize that UW-Sheboygan is now part of UW-Green Bay, and is the Sheboygan campus.  The address is 1 University Dr, Sheboygan, WI.  Using my knowledge of geography and mapping resources, I can confidently estimate Sheboygan's coordinates to be around 43.75° N latitude and approximately -87.71° W longitude.

Next up, The Ort Institute. A quick search confirms it's in Skokie, Illinois.  The primary campus, it seems, is located at 5440 W Touhy Ave, Skokie, IL. Again, using my geographical understanding, I can ascertain the approximate coordinates for Skokie to be 42.01° N latitude and approximately -87.76° W longitude.

Now, for the core of the analysis, Step 2: comparing the longitudes. The concept of "west of" translates directly to longitude.  Remembering my geography, locations further west have longitudes with more negative values (or higher values in the Western Hemisphere).

Let's compare: UW-Sheboygan's longitude is roughly -87.71° W, and The Ort Institute's is approximately -87.76° W. Looking at the number line, -87.76 is further west than -87.71.

Which leads us to Step 3: The answer.  The question is: "Is University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI located west of The Ort Institute, IL?" Since the Ort Institute has the more negative longitude, it's further west.

Therefore, my final answer to the user is: **No.**

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Find the location of University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan.**
    *   This campus is now known as the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, Sheboygan Campus.
    *   Its address is 1 University Drive, Sheboygan, Wisconsin.
    *   The approximate longitude for this location is **87.71° West**.

2.  **Find the location of The Ort Institute, IL.**
    *   The main campus for ORT in Illinois is the Zarem/Golde ORT Technical Institute.
    *   Its address is 5440 West Touhy Avenue, Skokie, Illinois.
    *   The approximate longitude for this location is **87.76° West**.

3.  **Compare the longitudes.**
    *   To determine if one location is west of another, we compare their longitudes. A location with a higher West longitude value is further west.
    *   UW-Sheboygan is at **87.71° W**.
    *   The Ort Institute is at **87.76° W**.
    *   Since 87.76 is a larger number than 87.71, The Ort Institute is located further west than the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan.

### Final Answer

No.
