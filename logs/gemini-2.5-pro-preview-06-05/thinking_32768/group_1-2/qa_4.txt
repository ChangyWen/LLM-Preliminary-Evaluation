*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let me think this through. The user wants to know if Hillman Houses in Manhattan is south of Williamsburg *in* Manhattan. Hmm.

First, let's break this down. We have two locations: Hillman Houses and Williamsburg. The question is about their relative positions.

Alright, what do I know? Hillman Houses… I know that's a housing cooperative, a pretty significant one, right? Yes, it's part of Cooperative Village on the Lower East Side. And the Lower East Side is definitely in Manhattan. Okay, good. Grand Street, Lewis Street, that general area. Got it.

Now, Williamsburg. Ah, here's where it gets interesting. "Williamsburg, Manhattan." That's... a potential problem. Williamsburg is, of course, a major neighborhood, very well-known. But it's in *Brooklyn*. This sounds like a factual error. I need to address that first.

So, here's how I'll tackle this. Step 1: Pinpoint Hillman Houses. It's on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. I'll be specific and mention the general area, like near Grand Street. Step 2: The real kicker. Williamsburg isn’t in Manhattan; it's in Brooklyn. It's right across the East River. Step 3: Compare the actual locations. Now that we have the correct locations, we can compare them. Hillman Houses on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Williamsburg in Brooklyn. Step 4: Relative Positions. Mentally, or using a map, the Lower East Side is generally west of Williamsburg. In terms of latitude, they're pretty close. The southern part of Williamsburg might be slightly *south* of the Lower East Side, but overall, the critical thing is that one is on one side of the East River and the other on the other side.

Therefore, my final answer is "No." The reason is straightforward: Williamsburg isn't in Manhattan. Hillman Houses is in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and Williamsburg is in Brooklyn. They're across the East River from each other, at roughly similar latitudes. The Lower East Side is generally west of Williamsburg. That should be clear, concise, and informative. I think that covers it. Let's go with that.

**************************************** Content ***************************************
Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the relative locations of Hillman Houses and Williamsburg.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the location of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan:** Hillman Houses is a housing cooperative located in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. It is situated near the East River, around Grand Street and Lewis Street.

2.  **Identify the location of WILLIAMSBURG:** This is the key point. Williamsburg is a major neighborhood in the borough of **Brooklyn**, not Manhattan. It lies directly across the East River from the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

3.  **Correct the premise of the question:** The question assumes that both Hillman Houses and Williamsburg are in Manhattan. This is incorrect. Since Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, Hillman Houses cannot be south of a "Williamsburg, Manhattan."

4.  **Compare the actual locations:**
    *   Hillman Houses is in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
    *   Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, across the East River.
    *   Geographically, Hillman Houses is located to the **west** of Williamsburg. They are at very similar latitudes, with parts of Williamsburg being slightly north and other parts slightly south of Hillman Houses' latitude. Therefore, describing one as being simply "south" of the other is not accurate.

### Final Answer

**No.**

The reason is that Williamsburg is not located in Manhattan; it is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. Hillman Houses is located in Manhattan, across the East River to the west of Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
