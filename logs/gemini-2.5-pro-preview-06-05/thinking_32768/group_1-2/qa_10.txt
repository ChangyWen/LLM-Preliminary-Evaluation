*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know which song came out first, "Pull Me Under" by Dream Theater or "Jimmy James" by the Beastie Boys. They want a step-by-step breakdown leading to a "Yes" or "No" answer. Okay, I can handle this.

First, I break down the request. I need to find release dates for both songs and then compare them. Sounds simple enough. So:
1.  **Find the release date for "Pull Me Under."** I know that song is on *Images and Words*.  Let's search for "Dream Theater Pull Me Under release date". Aha, the album came out July 7, 1992.  Okay, so "Pull Me Under" as a track was available then.  I'll also check for single release information just to be thorough, "Pull Me Under single release date".  Wikipedia and Discogs say August 29, 1992. Got it.

    *   *Pull Me Under* (album): July 7, 1992.
    *   *Pull Me Under* (single): August 29, 1992.

2.  **Find the release date for "Jimmy James."**  This one's on *Check Your Head*. Let's search "Beastie Boys Jimmy James release date". Right, the album *Check Your Head* released on April 21, 1992. That's the key date! Let's check the single release. Okay, "Jimmy James single release date". Wikipedia says July 2, 1992. Hmmm...some Discogs entries show it released earlier (April 1992). It looks like the album release date is the most solid date, because that's the first time the song was available to the public.

    *   *Check Your Head* (containing "Jimmy James"): April 21, 1992.

3.  **Compare the Dates:**

    *   "Jimmy James" (on *Check Your Head*): **April 21, 1992**
    *   "Pull Me Under" (on *Images and Words*): **July 7, 1992**

    April 21, 1992, definitely comes *before* July 7, 1992.

4.  **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
    *   **Step 1:**  "Jimmy James" is on *Check Your Head*.
    *   **Step 2:** *Check Your Head* was released April 21, 1992.
    *   **Step 3:**  "Pull Me Under" is on *Images and Words*.
    *   **Step 4:** *Images and Words* was released July 7, 1992.
    *   **Step 5:** April 21, 1992, is before July 7, 1992.
    *   **Step 6:** "Jimmy James" came out first.

5.  **Final Answer:**
    *   The question: "Was Dream Theater’s Pull Me Under released earlier than Beastie Boys’s Jimmy James?"  "Pull Me Under" came out later. The answer is **No**.

Okay, that's it. Clear, concise, and sourced. All boxes checked.
