*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know if Schiller International University in Florida is located north of the University of Tampa. Simple enough. I need to break this down methodically.

First, I have to figure out where each university is located. Step one: where is Schiller International University in Florida? Let's search for the location. Ah, the main Florida campus is in Largo, FL. I'll need to find the address for the coordinates. Okay, a quick search reveals the address: 8560 Ulmerton Rd, Largo, FL 33771. Now, let me get the approximate coordinates. A quick search for those coordinates gives me roughly 27.89° N latitude. That's a key piece of information.

Next, the University of Tampa. Where is it? Tampa, Florida, obviously. Okay, what's the address? 401 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33606. Let's get the coordinates for that too. Searching, I find approximately 27.94° N latitude. Got it.

Now, time to compare. I have the latitudes: Schiller in Largo is around 27.89° N, and the University of Tampa is around 27.94° N. "North" means a higher latitude, right? The University of Tampa's latitude is higher. So, UT is north of Schiller.

Since the question asks if Schiller is *north* of UT, the answer is no. Schiller is south of UT.

Now to formulate the reasoning for the user. I'll need to present this step-by-step.

**Step 1:** Find Schiller's location in Florida - Largo, FL, address 8560 Ulmerton Rd.
**Step 2:** Find the University of Tampa - Tampa, FL, address 401 W Kennedy Blvd.
**Step 3:** Compare geographic positions. Largo is generally southwest of downtown Tampa. Latitude is the key metric here.
**Step 4:** State latitudes. Schiller is approximately 27.89° N, UT is approximately 27.94° N.
**Step 5:** Conclude: UT has a higher latitude, therefore UT is north of Schiller. Thus, Schiller is *not* north of UT.

Finally, the answer: **No**.

Let me review. The steps are logical, the information's accurate, and it answers the question directly. Clear, concise, and helpful. I think this is good to go.
