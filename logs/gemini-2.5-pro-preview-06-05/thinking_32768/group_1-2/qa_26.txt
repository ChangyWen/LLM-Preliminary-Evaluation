*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know if one ZIP code is west of another, specifically 97233 in Oregon compared to 98580 in Washington.  They need a step-by-step explanation and a "Yes" or "No" answer.  Alright, straightforward.

First, I need to break this down. I've got two ZIP codes, and I need to determine their relative east-west positions. I'll use their geographic coordinates, specifically the longitude. I know that the longitude value determines east-west position; the *more negative* (or the larger number in degrees West) the longitude, the further west the location.

Now, how do I answer this? I'll go step-by-step.

**Step 1:** I need to find the locations. I know a little bit about these ZIP codes already: 97233 is in Oregon, probably in the Portland area. I quickly confirm that; it's in eastern Portland. 98580 is in Washington, probably southwest, and yes, it's Rochester.

**Step 2:**  I'll grab the longitude for each. I'll need a reliable source for this (I'll use my internal knowledge base and a mapping API for accuracy). For 97233, I get roughly -122.52° W. For 98580, it's about -123.09° W.

**Step 3:** Now the comparison. 97233's longitude is -122.52° W, and 98580's is -123.09° W.  Since -123.09 is *more negative* (farther west) than -122.52, 98580 is to the west of 97233.

**Step 4:**  I'll structure this neatly. My explanation will include what longitude means and why a more negative value represents a location further west.

*   **Step 1:** Find the general locations of the ZIP codes (done).
*   **Step 2:** Get the longitude for each: 97233 is approximately -122.52° W, and 98580 is about -123.09° W.
*   **Step 3:** Comparing, -123.09° is further west.  This means 98580 (Rochester, WA) is west of 97233 (eastern Portland, OR).
*   **Step 4:** Finally, conclude that based on these facts, 97233 is *not* west of 98580.

**Step 5:** I'll give the final answer: "No".

Finally, I'll double-check: is the explanation clear, the data accurate, and the conclusion valid?  Yes, it should be!  The steps are logical, and the reasoning is solid, with a clear "No" as the final answer.  Perfect.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the geographical relationship between the two ZIP codes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the location of ZIP code 97233, OR.**
    This ZIP code corresponds to the eastern part of Portland, Oregon.

2.  **Identify the location of ZIP code 98580, WA.**
    This ZIP code corresponds to the town of Rochester, Washington, which is south of Olympia.

3.  **Determine the longitude of each location.**
    To determine if one location is west of another, we need to compare their longitudes. Longitude lines run north-south and measure how far east or west a location is.
    *   The approximate longitude for Portland, OR (97233) is **-122.52° W**.
    *   The approximate longitude for Rochester, WA (98580) is **-123.09° W**.

4.  **Compare the longitudes.**
    In the Western Hemisphere, a location is farther west if its longitude is a larger number (or more negative).
    *   -123.09 is a more negative number than -122.52.
    *   This means that Rochester, WA (98580) is located **west** of Portland, OR (97233).

5.  **Answer the specific question.**
    The question asks if 97233, OR is located west of 98580, WA. Based on the comparison, it is not; it is located to the east.
