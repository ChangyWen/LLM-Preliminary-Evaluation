*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The question is: is Cattaraugus County, NY west of Cambria County, PA? Simple enough, but it needs a methodical approach.

First, I'll pinpoint the core problem: I need to determine the east-west positions of these two counties.  That immediately tells me I need their longitudes.  West longitude, to be precise. The bigger the number, the further west.

So, plan of attack:  I'll look up the longitude of each county, compare the numbers, and then give a "yes" or "no" answer.

Step one: Cattaraugus County. A quick search for "longitude of Cattaraugus County, NY."  The approximate center is around 78.7 degrees West.

Step two:  Cambria County, Pennsylvania.  A quick search again, "longitude of Cambria County, PA."  Huh, that's also around 78.7 degrees West.  They're *very* close. This is a situation where a quick glance at a map might be smarter than relying solely on the numbers.

Revised plan. I'll visualize it, and look up more accurate coordinates.

*   Locate Cattaraugus County, NY: It's in western New York.
*   Locate Cambria County, PA: Central to Western Pennsylvania.
*   Refine my search. Precise coordinates for the *centers*: Cattaraugus is around 42.25° N, 78.69° W, and Cambria is around 40.48° N, 78.72° W.

Now, to the comparison: Cattaraugus: 78.69° W.  Cambria: 78.72° W.  Remember, a larger West longitude means it's further west.  So, 78.72 is bigger than 78.69. Cambria County is slightly west of Cattaraugus County.  Therefore, the answer must be no.

To present this correctly, I'll lay it out in a way that's clear and easy to follow:

Start with the conclusion: "No." Then I'll explain:

1.  The locations in question are Cattaraugus County, NY, and Cambria County, PA.

2.  We're comparing their east-west positions, and therefore we'll look at their longitude.  Cattaraugus County's approximate center is around 78.69° W. Cambria County's approximate center is around 78.72° W.

3.  In West longitude, the bigger the number, the further west the location.

4.  Because Cambria County, PA has a larger value for its West longitude (78.72° W) than Cattaraugus County, NY (78.69° W), Cambria County is slightly west of Cattaraugus County.  Thus, Cattaraugus County is to the east of Cambria County.

Then a simple, "No."

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the Goal:** The goal is to determine if Cattaraugus County, NY is located to the west of Cambria County, PA.

2.  **Use Longitude for Comparison:** To determine the east-west position of any two locations, we must compare their longitudes. A location with a greater West longitude (a larger number) is farther west.

3.  **Find the Longitude of Cattaraugus County, NY:** The approximate longitude for the center of Cattaraugus County, New York, is **78.69° W**.

4.  **Find the Longitude of Cambria County, PA:** The approximate longitude for the center of Cambria County, Pennsylvania, is **78.72° W**.

5.  **Compare the Longitudes:**
    *   Cattaraugus County, NY: 78.69° W
    *   Cambria County, PA: 78.72° W

    Since 78.72 is a larger number than 78.69, Cambria County, PA is located slightly farther west than Cattaraugus County, NY.

6.  **Conclusion:** Because Cattaraugus County has a smaller West longitude value, it is located slightly **east** of Cambria County.
