Alright, let's break this down. The core question is simple: did William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, die *after* Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy? Straightforward comparison of death dates.

First, I need to find the information. Let's access the knowledge base for William de Warenne. I'll be looking for his death date specifically. Okay, found it: June 24, 1088, in Lewes, Sussex. Now, for Agnes of Aquitaine. Searching for her death dateâ€¦ found it: June 6, 1078, in Turin.
