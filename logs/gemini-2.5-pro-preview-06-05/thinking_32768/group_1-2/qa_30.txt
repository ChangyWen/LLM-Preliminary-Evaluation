*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'm going to tackle this request.  First, I need to be crystal clear on what's being asked: is Lake Vico west of Pragser Wildsee? The user wants the full breakdown, the whole shebang – the reasoning *and* the final "yes" or "no." No problem, I can deliver.

My first instinct is to zero in on those two lakes. I need their locations – and fast. Where are these things, specifically?  I'll tap into my internal geographical knowledge; it's usually pretty reliable, but I'll mentally run a quick cross-check (like I would with a search engine or a good map app) just to be absolutely sure.

So, step one: Lake Vico.  My mental database says it's a volcanic crater lake, smack-dab in central Italy. Lazio region, near Viterbo, to be exact. Approximate coordinates: 42.3° North, 12.17° East.  Got it.

Next up: Pragser Wildsee. Ah, that one's easier, a beauty of a lake in the Dolomites, Northern Italy. South Tyrol province.  And the coordinates... roughly 46.7° North, 12.08° East. Okay, excellent. Both locations locked down.

Now, time to compare.  I have the key info: Lake Vico's around 12.17° East, and Pragser Wildsee's about 12.08° East.  The east-west game is all about longitude, and I know that a smaller longitude means further west.

So, Vico's longitude (12.17°) is *greater than* Pragser Wildsee's (12.08°).  That means Vico is further *east*.

Now, I'll arrange my thought process into the appropriate format for this task. I'll start with where Vico is, then where Wildsee is, and then compare their locations in terms of east and west.

I'll clearly state my conclusion. Lake Vico is east of Pragser Wildsee.  Since the initial question asked if Vico was *west* of Wildsee, the answer is "No." Simple as that.

I'll assemble the final response, making sure it's clear, complete, and accurate. I've covered every step, presented the geographical information correctly, and answered the user's question directly. All good.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the relative locations of the two lakes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the location of Lake Vico.**
    Lake Vico (Lago di Vico) is a volcanic crater lake located in **central Italy**, within the Lazio region. Its approximate longitude is **12.17° East**.

2.  **Identify the location of Pragser Wildsee.**
    Pragser Wildsee (Lago di Braies) is a famous mountain lake located in the Dolomites of **northern Italy**, within the South Tyrol province. Its approximate longitude is **12.08° East**.

3.  **Compare the longitudes.**
    To determine if one location is west or east of another, we compare their longitudes. A location with a smaller longitude is to the west of a location with a larger longitude.
    *   Longitude of Lake Vico: ~12.17° E
    *   Longitude of Pragser Wildsee: ~12.08° E

    Since 12.17 is a larger number than 12.08, Lake Vico is located to the **east** of Pragser Wildsee.

### Final Answer

No.
