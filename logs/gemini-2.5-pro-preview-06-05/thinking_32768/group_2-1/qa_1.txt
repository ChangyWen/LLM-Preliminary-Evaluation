*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this question. First, I need to understand exactly what the user wants. They're asking me to figure out whether a blue whale is heavier than an elephant and to show my work, so to speak. This means I need to build a solid argument and end with a clear "yes" or "no" answer.

First, the initial knowledge and brainstorming phase. I know a blue whale is the biggest animal on the planet. That usually means heavy, but I need specifics. Let's get some solid weight ranges for the blue whale, in tons or kilograms. And since the elephant is a terrestrial animal, that's the biggest animal on land. African elephants are bigger than Asian ones, so let's focus on them. What's a good weight range for a big male African elephant? This is going to involve numbers. Comparing the numbers will be the key. Okay, so a whale versus an elephant… the whale is going to win. But I need to be precise.

Now, I will construct the step-by-step reasoning. I will start by identifying the animals, the blue whale, and the African Bush Elephant since it is the largest. I’ll begin with the whale. I'll point out it’s the largest animal on Earth, and then get some weight ranges. Hmm, I think the average blue whale can weigh around 100 to 200 tons. Converting that to kilograms, that's a whopping 100,000 to 200,000 kg! Let's not forget that the heaviest one ever recorded was close to 200 metric tons! Wow! That’s mind-blowing. Okay, that's a big number. And how to make that understandable… How about relating it to the elephant? A blue whale can weigh as much as thirty elephants! Perfect.

Next, let's look at the elephant. The African Bush Elephant. I’ll point out it is the largest land animal. Then a good weight range for a big male, probably up to six or seven tons, or four to seven metric tons (4,000 to 7,000 kg). Also noting that females are smaller, just to show my depth of understanding.

Now comes the comparison. This is the heart of it. Blue Whale: roughly 100,000 to 200,000 kg. African Elephant: 4,000 to 7,000 kg. The whale is much heavier. I can do the math for that elephant comparison: on average, a blue whale weighs as much as 25 or more large elephants.

Finally, I will give a clear conclusion. The blue whale’s weight is at least an order of magnitude greater. Even the lightest blue whale will significantly outweigh the heaviest elephant.

Lastly, the final answer. I’ll put it right at the end as a bold, one-word statement.

Now, before I finalize it, I have to review everything. Are the numbers accurate? Yes, the weight ranges are standard, and easy to reference. Is it logical? Yes. Does it meet all parts of the prompt? Absolutely. Is the final answer clear? Yes. The structure is perfect: introduce the subjects, then provide data for each, compare the data, and then conclude. It is a great response. It has a strong final answer, the step-by-step, and the supporting information. It’s ready.

**Yes**

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which animal is heavier.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Identify the weight of an elephant.**
The elephant is the largest land animal on Earth. We should use the largest species of elephant for a fair comparison, which is the African Bush Elephant.
*   An average adult African elephant weighs between **4 to 7 tons** (approximately 4,000 to 7,000 kilograms or 8,800 to 15,400 pounds).

**Step 2: Identify the weight of a blue whale.**
The blue whale is the largest animal on the planet, living in the ocean.
*   An average adult blue whale weighs between **100 to 200 tons** (approximately 100,000 to 200,000 kilograms or 220,000 to 440,000 pounds).

**Step 3: Compare the weights directly.**
Now, let's place the numbers side-by-side.
*   **Heaviest Elephant:** ~7 tons
*   **Lightest Adult Blue Whale:** ~100 tons

The comparison shows that even the lightest adult blue whale is more than 14 times heavier than the heaviest elephant. An average blue whale can weigh as much as 25-30 elephants combined.

### Final Answer

**Yes.**
