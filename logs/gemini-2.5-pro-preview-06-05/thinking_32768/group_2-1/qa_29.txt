*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a straightforward answer about the wavelengths of red and blue light, plus a detailed explanation.  First things first, I need to figure out the best way to tackle this.

I immediately recall the electromagnetic spectrum; light is part of that, and visible light is just a sliver of it.  I know the colors of visible light go in a specific order: ROYGBIV – Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. That's the key to unlocking this.  Now, the core question: is red light's wavelength longer than blue's?

I have to remember the relationships here: wavelength, frequency, and energy are linked. Long wavelengths mean low frequencies and low energy, while short wavelengths are high frequency and high energy.  Hmm... I know that infrared light sits beyond red, and ultraviolet is beyond violet. Infrared has *longer* wavelengths than visible light, so red must be at the long-wavelength end.  Ultraviolet has *shorter* wavelengths, so blue and violet must be at the shorter end of the spectrum. Got it!

So, how do I structure this for the user?  First, I should give some background – the electromagnetic spectrum. Then, the visible light spectrum (ROYGBIV).  Next, I'll define wavelength, using a simple analogy like water waves.  Then comes the critical part: linking wavelength to the colors. I'll start with red being the longest wavelength, and as you move through the colors to blue, the wavelength gets shorter. To really solidify it, I might throw in some approximate wavelength ranges for red and blue light.

As a bonus, I can touch upon how this relates to frequency and energy – red is lower energy, blue is higher. I have to make sure to give the user a clear "Yes or No" answer at the end. Finally, I'll go back to make sure everything is crystal clear and easy to follow. The answer is yes.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Understanding Light as a Wave**
Light travels as an electromagnetic wave. Like any wave, it has properties, one of the most important being its **wavelength**. Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks (or troughs) of the wave.

**Step 2: The Visible Light Spectrum**
The light that our eyes can see is a small portion of the full electromagnetic spectrum. We perceive different wavelengths within this visible spectrum as different colors. The order of colors in the visible spectrum is commonly remembered by the acronym **ROYGBIV**:

*   **R**ed
*   **O**range
*   **Y**ellow
*   **G**reen
*   **B**lue
*   **I**ndigo
*   **V**iolet

**Step 3: Relating Wavelength to the Color Spectrum**
This order (ROYGBIV) is arranged from the longest wavelength to the shortest wavelength.

*   **Red light** is at one end of the spectrum and has the **longest** wavelength of all visible colors.
*   As you move through the colors from red towards violet, the wavelength gets progressively **shorter**.
*   **Violet light** is at the other end of the spectrum and has the **shortest** wavelength.

**Step 4: Comparing Red and Blue Light**
Based on the order in the spectrum (ROYGBIV), Red comes long before Blue. This means that red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

*   **Red Light Wavelength:** Approximately 620 to 750 nanometers (nm).
*   **Blue Light Wavelength:** Approximately 450 to 495 nanometers (nm).

Comparing these numerical ranges, it is clear that the wavelength of red light is longer than that of blue light.

### Final Answer

**Yes.**
