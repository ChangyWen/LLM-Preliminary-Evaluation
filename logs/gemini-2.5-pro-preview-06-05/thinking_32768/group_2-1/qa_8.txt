*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know if the Sahara is hotter than the Gobi. Easy enough. First, I'll give them the direct answer – yes, the Sahara is indeed hotter. Then, I'll break down the reasoning for them. It needs to be clear, logical, and cover all the bases.

My first thought is to brainstorm: *Sahara = hot, Africa, near the equator, sand, consistent heat*. *Gobi = cold, Asia, high latitude, extreme temperatures, winter snow, high altitude*. That's a good starting point.

Now, the structure: I'll start with the "Yes," then provide the step-by-step explanation. The reasoning will be broken down into key factors, the way I would explain it to a colleague: average temperatures (the core comparison!), geographic location and latitude (that's the *why* behind it), altitude (another major factor), climate type (the technical context), and temperature extremes (to really show the full picture). I'll wrap it up with a table for easy reference and restate the answer at the end.

Let's flesh out each point.

First, *average annual temperatures.* Sahara: I'm thinking roughly 20-25°C (68-77°F) on average, maybe even higher in some regions, but it’s important to emphasize that those are annual averages, and daily highs are much more dramatic. Gobi: definitely much colder, the "cold" desert. I'm thinking an average of maybe 2-3°C (36-38°F), which confirms the stark contrast. Boom: the Sahara is hotter on average.

Next, *geographic location and latitude.* Sahara is in North Africa, sitting near the Tropic of Cancer, a subtropical desert. The sun's rays hit at a much more direct angle, leading to that consistent heat throughout the year. The Gobi, on the other hand, is in Central/East Asia, around 40° to 50° N. That means lower sun angles, especially in winter, translating to significantly less solar energy. The Sahara gets more direct, intense solar radiation – that's the key.

Then, we have *altitude*. Sahara's pretty low-lying for the most part. But the Gobi is a high-altitude plateau. That high elevation contributes to a huge drop in temperatures.

Then, *climate types*. The Sahara is a hot, subtropical desert, that’s the defining characteristic - hot. The Gobi is a cold winter desert or a continental desert, defined by those extreme temperature swings. I should probably mention the Siberian anticyclone that really drives the cold winters in the Gobi.

I'll then make a summary table using all these factors: average temperature, latitude, altitude, climate type, and the key features of each. This visual will reinforce the main points nicely.

Okay, final review. The answer is clear at the beginning and end. The steps are logical and easy to follow, I've used both Celsius and Fahrenheit. The structure is solid. It directly addresses the prompt, so it should be great!

Final thought: the Sahara *is* hotter than the Gobi.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

To determine which desert is hotter, we need to compare them across several key climate factors, not just their highest recorded temperatures.

#### Step 1: Analyze Average Annual Temperature
This is the most important metric for overall climate. It accounts for both the hot summers and the cold winters.

*   **Sahara Desert:** As a subtropical desert, the Sahara experiences intensely hot summers and mild winters. Its average annual temperature is high, generally around **20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F)**, and even higher in its hottest regions.
*   **Gobi Desert:** As a cold winter desert, the Gobi has hot summers but brutally cold winters, with temperatures dropping far below freezing. This severe cold brings its average annual temperature way down, to approximately **2.5°C (36.5°F)**.

**Conclusion of Step 1:** The Sahara Desert has a significantly higher average annual temperature, making it hotter on a year-round basis.

#### Step 2: Compare Geographic Location (Latitude)
Latitude is the primary driver of how much direct sunlight a region receives throughout the year.

*   **Sahara Desert:** Located in North Africa, it straddles the Tropic of Cancer (23.5° N). Its low latitude means it receives intense, direct sunlight for most of the year, leading to sustained high temperatures.
*   **Gobi Desert:** Located in Northern China and Southern Mongolia, it sits at a much higher latitude (between 40° and 50° N). This means the sun's rays are less direct, especially during the long winter, resulting in far less solar energy and much colder temperatures.

**Conclusion of Step 2:** The Sahara's proximity to the equator makes it inherently hotter than the more northerly Gobi.

#### Step 3: Compare Altitude
Higher elevations are generally colder than lower elevations.

*   **Sahara Desert:** The Sahara is mostly a low-lying plateau, with vast areas just a few hundred meters above sea level.
*   **Gobi Desert:** The Gobi is a high-altitude desert, situated on a plateau with an average elevation of about **900 to 1,500 meters (3,000 to 5,000 feet)**. This high elevation contributes significantly to its colder climate.

**Conclusion of Step 3:** The Gobi's high altitude makes it significantly colder than the low-altitude Sahara.

#### Step 4: Compare Climate Classification and Temperature Extremes
The type of desert climate reveals its defining characteristics.

*   **Sahara Desert:** Classified as a **"hot desert."** Its defining feature is extreme heat. While summer highs can exceed 50°C (122°F), its winters are mild, rarely dropping to freezing except at the highest elevations.
*   **Gobi Desert:** Classified as a **"cold winter desert."** Its defining feature is its extreme temperature range. While summers can be hot (up to 40°C / 104°F), winters are frigid, with temperatures plummeting to **-40°C (-40°F)**. Snow and frost are common in winter.

**Conclusion of Step 4:** The Sahara is consistently hot, whereas the Gobi experiences extreme swings between hot summers and intensely cold winters. The Sahara's "lows" are much higher than the Gobi's "lows."

### Final Answer

**Yes.**

Based on the reasoning above—its higher average annual temperature, lower latitude, lower altitude, and its classification as a "hot desert"—the Sahara Desert is significantly hotter than the Gobi Desert.
