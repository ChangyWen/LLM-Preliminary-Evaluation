*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's what I'm thinking. The question is asking when two historical figures died, specifically which died later. Let's break this down methodically, as always.

First, I need to identify the two figures and the core question: Did Einstein die later than Newton? It's a simple comparison of death dates. I need to get the dates.

Okay, let's start with Albert Einstein. I know he was a 20th-century figure. His death date... April 18, 1955. Right, that's from my internal knowledge base.

Next, Isaac Newton. He's much earlier, the Scientific Revolution era. His death date... March 31, 1727. Using the Gregorian calendar for consistency, of course, and that's also from my knowledge base.

Now, to formulate the answer step-by-step, just like it was requested.

Step 1: Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955.

Step 2: Isaac Newton died on March 31, 1727.

Step 3: Comparing the two dates, the year 1955 is much later than the year 1727. Since 1955 occurred after 1727, Albert Einstein died later than Isaac Newton.

Final Answer: Yes

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Find Isaac Newton's date of death.**
    *   Isaac Newton died on March 31, 1727.

2.  **Find Albert Einstein's date of death.**
    *   Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955.

3.  **Compare the two dates.**
    *   The year 1955 comes after the year 1727 on the timeline. Therefore, Albert Einstein's death occurred at a later date than Isaac Newton's death.

### Final Answer

Yes
