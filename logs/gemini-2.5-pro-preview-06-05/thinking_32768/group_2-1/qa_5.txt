Alright, here's how I'm going to tackle this. First, I need to figure out what the core question is: Does Russia have a larger area than Australia? Got it. That means I need to find a logical, step-by-step explanation, and a definitive "yes" or "no" at the end. Easy enough.

Okay, time to tap into my knowledge base and pull up the numbers. I know the approximate areas of countries are in there somewhere. Let's see…

*   **Russia:** 17,098,246 square kilometers, or roughly 6,601,670 square miles. Biggest country in the world.
*   **Australia:** 7,692,024 square kilometers, or about 2,969,907 square miles. Sixth largest.

The numbers are clear. Russia's significantly bigger. Now to present this in a way that makes sense to the user. I'll break it down into distinct steps.

First, I'll lay out the goal: compare the areas of Russia and Australia. Then, I'll state Russia's area. Then Australia's. Next, the comparison: 17.1 million km² versus 7.7 million km². Russia is, indeed, much larger. I'll make it even clearer by stating the difference in scale: Australia fits into Russia more than twice.

Finally, the big finish: I'll put the final answer in a dedicated section, bolded, to leave no room for doubt.

Time for a quick review to make sure I've covered everything. Did I answer the question? Yep. Step-by-step reasoning? Check. Clear "Yes" or "No" answer? Absolutely. Accurate information? Double-checked. Easy to understand language? Hopefully, yes. Good to go.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine if Russia is larger in area than Australia.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Identify the total area of Russia.**
Russia is the largest country in the world by land area. Its total area is approximately **17,098,246 square kilometers** (or about 6,601,670 square miles).

**Step 2: Identify the total area of Australia.**
Australia is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. Its total area is approximately **7,692,024 square kilometers** (or about 2,969,907 square miles).

**Step 3: Compare the two areas.**
We now compare the figure from Step 1 with the figure from Step 2.
*   **Russia:** 17,098,246 km²
*   **Australia:** 7,692,024 km²

17,098,246 is a much larger number than 7,692,024. In fact, Russia's area is more than double the area of Australia.
