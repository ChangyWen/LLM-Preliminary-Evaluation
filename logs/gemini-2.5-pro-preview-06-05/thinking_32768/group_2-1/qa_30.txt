Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comparison of human and dog lifespans, along with a clear "Yes" or "No" at the end. Here's how I'll approach this:

First, I need to gather my facts. What's the global average human lifespan these days? I think I remember seeing something from the WHO or UN… *pause* Okay, a quick check suggests around 73 years is a reasonable estimate for a global average in the early 2020s. I need to remember that's an *average*, and it varies widely depending on where you live, access to healthcare, and other factors.

Next, dogs. Dog lifespans…it's trickier. It’s *highly* breed-dependent. I know the general average is much shorter, something like 10-13 years, but that's just a broad range. This is the key part of the answer, and I'll need to explain the variation. Small breeds tend to live longer – a Chihuahua might live for 15-20 years. Medium-sized dogs, like Beagles or Border Collies, probably hit around 12-15. Then you have those giant breeds like Great Danes and Mastiffs, which, sadly, often have much shorter lifespans, sometimes only 6-10 years.

I also need to address that "7 dog years to 1 human year" myth. It's a simplistic and misleading notion. It's *not* linear. Dogs mature rapidly in their early years, which is important to illustrate. A one-year-old dog is closer to a teenager than a seven-year-old child.

Now, I need to structure this information logically. Let's break it down step-by-step:

*   **Step 1: Human Lifespan.** State the average, the approximate global average is ~73 years. Briefly mention that it varies.

*   **Step 2: Dog Lifespan.** State the *range* – probably 10-13 years, but then – crucially – explain the breed variation. Provide those specific examples: small breeds, medium breeds, large/giant breeds with example breeds and lifespan ranges.

*   **Step 3: Address the myth.** Briefly explain that the "7 years" rule is oversimplified and doesn't account for different aging patterns. It’s not a linear relationship.

*   **Step 4: Comparison and Conclusion.** Now, bring it all together. Human: ~73 years; dog: ~10-13 years (or even 6-20 years depending on the breed, which is still far less).

Finally, I will give the user their concise answer, the requested "Yes" or "No." I will read it over to check for clarity and that all the requirements are met. It is a clear question and has to have an equally clear answer. Okay, let's go.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Determine the average human lifespan.**
The average human lifespan varies by country, gender, and access to healthcare, but global data provides a reliable average. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations, the average global life expectancy at birth is approximately **73 years**.

**Step 2: Determine the average dog lifespan.**
A dog's lifespan is not a single number; it is heavily dependent on its breed, size, and genetics.
*   **Small Breeds** (e.g., Chihuahua, Jack Russell Terrier) often live the longest, with an average lifespan of **14-17 years**.
*   **Medium Breeds** (e.g., Beagle, Border Collie) have an average lifespan of **12-15 years**.
*   **Large and Giant Breeds** (e.g., Great Dane, Mastiff) have the shortest lifespans, often averaging only **7-10 years**.

If we take a general average across all breeds, the typical dog lifespan falls into a range of **10 to 13 years**.

**Step 3: Compare the two lifespans.**
Now, we place the two figures side-by-side for a direct comparison:
*   **Average Human Lifespan:** ~73 years
*   **Average Dog Lifespan:** ~10-13 years

Even the longest-living dog breeds, which might reach 20 years in rare cases, do not come close to the average human lifespan. The average human lives significantly longer than the average dog.

### Final Answer

**Yes.**
