*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this. First, the user wants to know if Everest is taller than K2. Easy enough on the surface, but they also want a step-by-step explanation and a "Yes" or "No" answer. I like this; it forces me to be thorough.

My immediate reaction? Everest is taller. It's the highest point on Earth. K2 is second. No problem there. But, I need to *prove* it, not just state it.

So, first things first, let's get the data right. I know the official heights. I should double-check the figures, but I'm pretty confident. Okay, I'll look up the exact figures, including both meters and feet, because that makes it accessible to a broader audience. 

Right, Everest: 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet). K2: 8,611 meters (28,251 feet). Now, I’ll need to write up the step-by-step reasoning process.

Let’s break it down for clarity:
1.  We identify the mountains: Mount Everest and K2.
2.  We'll state the height of Everest. And it's important to cite the current official measurement, just for credibility.
3.  We'll state the height of K2.
4.  Then, and this is key, we *compare* the numbers. And I’ll include the difference in height to give the user an idea of *how much* taller Everest is.
5.  Finally, we'll explicitly link that comparison to the question.

To make the reasoning really clear, I'll present the numbers in both meters and feet, and calculate the difference. The "difference" part is critical, I think, because it shows the scale of the difference, which makes the reasoning stronger.

And of course, at the end, I *must* provide a clear "Yes" or "No" answer, to directly address the core question.

I can probably add a little extra information. K2's known to be a brutal climb. I can mention that quickly – about why, even though it's not as tall, it's sometimes considered a more formidable challenge.

Now, let's put it all together to get a complete, thoughtful, accurate response.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Identify the objects for comparison.**
We are comparing the height of two mountains: Mount Everest and K2. Height is measured as elevation above sea level.

**Step 2: State the official height of Mount Everest.**
The official, and most recently confirmed, elevation of Mount Everest is **8,848.86 meters** (or **29,031.7 feet**) above sea level.

**Step 3: State the official height of K2.**
The official elevation of K2 is **8,611 meters** (or **28,251 feet**) above sea level.

**Step 4: Compare the two heights.**
We can now directly compare the numerical values of their elevations.
*   In meters: 8,848.86 m (Everest) is greater than 8,611 m (K2).
*   In feet: 29,031.7 ft (Everest) is greater than 28,251 ft (K2).

The difference in height is 237.86 meters (780.7 feet).

**Step 5: Draw the conclusion.**
Since the elevation of Mount Everest is a larger number than the elevation of K2, Mount Everest is the taller mountain. In fact, Mount Everest is the tallest mountain on Earth, and K2 is the second tallest.

### Final Answer

**Yes**
