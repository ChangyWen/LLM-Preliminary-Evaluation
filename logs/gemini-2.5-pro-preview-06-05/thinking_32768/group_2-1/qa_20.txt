Okay, here's how I'd approach this. First, I need to understand the user's query: they want to know if the atomic number of oxygen is higher than that of carbon. They want a step-by-step explanation leading to a "Yes" or "No" answer. Right.

So, I'll start by defining my terms. Atomic number. Yes, itâ€™s the number of protons in an atom's nucleus and it identifies the element. That's the fundamental concept. Now, where do I find these atomic numbers? Ah yes, the periodic table.

Next, I need to identify the atomic numbers of carbon and oxygen. Let's see... carbon (C). Where does it fit on the table? I have a visual of the periodic table in my head. It's a fundamental building block. Carbon is in group 14. Okay, I'm placing the elements in the appropriate order: Carbon is the 6th element. That means carbon's atomic number is 6.

Now, oxygen (O). It's in group 16. Following on from Carbon, I can see it's the 8th element. Oxygen's atomic number is therefore 8.

Now, to compare them: Oxygen's atomic number is 8 and Carbon's atomic number is 6. Clearly, 8 is greater than 6. Therefore, the atomic number of oxygen is higher than that of carbon.

The answer is yes.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Define Atomic Number:** The atomic number of an element is defined by the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element. It is the fundamental property that identifies an element.

2.  **Find the Atomic Number of Carbon (C):** If you look at the Periodic Table of Elements, Carbon (symbol C) is the 6th element. This means it has an atomic number of 6. Every carbon atom has 6 protons.

3.  **Find the Atomic Number of Oxygen (O):** Looking at the Periodic Table, Oxygen (symbol O) is the 8th element. This means it has an atomic number of 8. Every oxygen atom has 8 protons.

4.  **Compare the Values:** We now compare the atomic number of Oxygen (8) with the atomic number of Carbon (6). Since 8 is a larger number than 6, the atomic number of oxygen is higher than that of carbon.

### Final Answer

Yes.
