Okay, here's how I'd approach this. First, I need to understand what the user is asking: does ice melt at a lower temperature than water boils? Got it. It requires a "Yes or No" answer along with a detailed explanation.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I'll identify key concepts. I know I need to consider "melting point of ice," "boiling point of water," and what exactly they mean physically. Ice is just solid water, and water can exist as a liquid and as steam, a gas. The question involves a comparison of temperatures so, I need to think in degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit. I'll also remember to mention standard pressure.

To organize this, I'll start with a direct "Yes or No" answer, then provide step-by-step reasoning. That's what's asked for, so that's what I will do! I'll structure the answer as follows:

*   **Step 1:** Define the concepts: melting and boiling points.
*   **Step 2:** Identify the values for these points (in both Celsius and Fahrenheit).
*   **Step 3:** Compare those numerical values.
*   **Step 4:** Explain the physical process and why this comparison makes sense.

Now for the details.

*   **Step 1:** I need to define "melting point." It's the temperature at which a solid turns into a liquid. In our case, ice (solid water) turns into liquid water. "Boiling point" is the temperature at which a liquid transforms into a gas – water into steam. I'll also emphasize that these temperatures are usually discussed at standard atmospheric pressure.

*   **Step 2:** I need to state the actual temperatures. I know them, but I should double-check... The melting point of ice is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit). I'll provide both Celsius and Fahrenheit to make the answer more helpful and complete.

*   **Step 3:** Simple comparison here. I'll compare the values on each scale. 0°C is clearly less than 100°C and 32°F is less than 212°F.

*   **Step 4:** Now for the "why." Think about the phases of water: ice (solid), water (liquid), and steam (gas). To go from solid to liquid (melting), you need to add some energy, and to go from liquid to gas (boiling) you need to add even more energy. Therefore, the boiling point must be at a higher temperature.

Now I can start drafting the actual answer. I'll be sure to use clear and concise language to directly answer the user's question. After writing the answer I'll read it and make sure it is clear, logical, and complete.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Define Melting Point:** The melting point is the specific temperature at which a substance changes its state from a solid to a liquid. For ice (the solid form of water), this is the temperature at which it melts and becomes liquid water.

2.  **Define Boiling Point:** The boiling point is the specific temperature at which a substance changes its state from a liquid to a gas (or vapor). For liquid water, this is the temperature at which it boils and becomes steam.

3.  **Identify the Value for the Melting Point of Ice:** At standard atmospheric pressure (the pressure at sea level), ice melts at **0° Celsius** (or **32° Fahrenheit**).

4.  **Identify the Value for the Boiling Point of Water:** At standard atmospheric pressure, water boils at **100° Celsius** (or **212° Fahrenheit**).

5.  **Compare the Two Values:**
    *   On the Celsius scale, **0°C** is clearly a lower temperature than **100°C**.
    *   On the Fahrenheit scale, **32°F** is clearly a lower temperature than **212°F**.

6.  **Conclusion:** Since the temperature required to melt ice is numerically lower than the temperature required to boil water, the melting point of ice is lower than the boiling point of water. This is because melting (solid to liquid) requires less energy input than boiling (liquid to gas).

### Final Answer

**Yes.**
