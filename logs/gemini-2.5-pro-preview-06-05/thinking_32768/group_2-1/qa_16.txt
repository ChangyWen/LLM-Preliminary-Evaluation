*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's see. The user wants a step-by-step explanation to determine if the boiling point of water is higher than its freezing point. Right, simple enough, but I need to be thorough.

First, I need to understand what the user is asking. It's a basic question, but I can't assume any prior knowledge. I need to define "boiling point" and "freezing point," the core of the query. That sets the foundation. Then, I'll give the actual numbers, the temperatures. Celsius and Fahrenheit – use both; it's good practice and covers all bases. Then, the key step is the comparison: which number is bigger? That's the core answer.

Now, *why* is the boiling point higher? I need a solid explanation. Energy, that's the key. I'll explain it in terms of molecular motion. Start with ice – low energy, molecules are mostly locked in place. Then freezing/melting – a transition, molecules gain energy. Liquid – they're moving more, sliding past each other. And finally, boiling – a massive energy boost, the molecules break free and become a gas. That energy difference *explains* the difference in temperature.

I need to follow a clear structure. First, define the terms: freezing point is when a liquid becomes a solid; boiling point is when a liquid becomes a gas. Then, the numbers: freezing point of water is 0°C (32°F), and the boiling point is 100°C (212°F). And it's important to clarify these values are at standard atmospheric pressure.

Next, I explicitly state the comparison: 100°C is higher than 0°C, and 212°F is higher than 32°F. The values are undeniably different. Finally, a summary and the answer. I'll reiterate the conclusion, maybe add a little about the energy required to change the state of matter, and state the answer is yes.

I'm going to structure the answer like this: first a clear statement to set the stage, then the definitions, then the values, comparison, and finally the clear "Yes" or "No" answer. Perfect. Now, to execute this:

*   **Step 1: Define Freezing.** Right, it's the point where a liquid becomes a solid. And at the molecular level, water molecules slow down and form ice.

*   **Step 2: Define Boiling.** The point where a liquid transforms into a gas. And the water molecules have enough energy to break free and become steam.

*   **Step 3: State the Temperatures.** Freezing point of water is 0° Celsius (32° Fahrenheit), standard, sea level pressure. Boiling point of water is 100° Celsius (212° Fahrenheit), also standard pressure. Important detail.

*   **Step 4: Comparison.** 100°C is higher than 0°C, and 212°F is higher than 32°F. This is simple.

*   **Step 5: The Answer.** Final Answer: Yes. The boiling point requires more energy to change the state of matter than the freezing point. Done.

Let me review to confirm I have everything. Yes, it's all there. Definitions, values, a clear comparison, and a concluding explanation to solidify my answer. It's clear, logical, and correct.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Define the Freezing Point of Water**
The freezing point is the specific temperature at which a substance transitions from a liquid state to a solid state. For water, this is the point where liquid water turns into solid ice. At this temperature, the water molecules slow down and arrange themselves into a fixed, crystalline structure.

**Step 2: Define the Boiling Point of Water**
The boiling point is the specific temperature at which a substance transitions from a liquid state to a gaseous state. For water, this is the point where liquid water turns into a gas (steam). At this temperature, the water molecules have gained enough energy to move very rapidly and escape the forces holding them together as a liquid.

**Step 3: Assign Numerical Values to These Points**
To compare the two points, we use a standard temperature scale. The two most common scales are Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F).

*   The freezing point of water is **0° C** (or **32° F**).
*   The boiling point of water is **100° C** (or **212° F**).

*(Note: These values are at standard atmospheric pressure at sea level.)*

**Step 4: Compare the Numerical Values**
Now, we directly compare the temperatures for boiling and freezing.

*   **Using the Celsius scale:** 100 is a higher number than 0. Therefore, 100°C is a higher temperature than 0°C.
*   **Using the Fahrenheit scale:** 212 is a higher number than 32. Therefore, 212°F is a higher temperature than 32°F.

In both systems of measurement, the temperature required to boil water is significantly higher than the temperature at which it freezes.

### Final Answer

**Yes.**
