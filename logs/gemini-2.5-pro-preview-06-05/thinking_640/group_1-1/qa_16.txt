Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking a straightforward geographic question: Is the Ort Institute, in Illinois, west of the University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan? Simple enough. My task is to provide a definitive answer, along with the reasoning behind it.

First, I need to clearly define the problem. We have two locations, and the question revolves around their relative *westward* positions. I'll need to find their geographic coordinates and compare their longitudes.

Okay, step one: pinpointing the locations. I know "The Ort Institute, IL" likely refers to the Zarem/Golde ORT Technical Institute. I'll need to confirm its precise location. Ah, a quick search confirms it's in Skokie, Illinois. Let's get those coordinates; I'm going to lean towards slightly more precise coordinates, since the difference may be narrow. Skokie is a Chicago suburb, which gives me a decent starting point. Let's say roughly 42.03° N, 87.75° W.

Now, for "University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI." This is a former UW system campus. The full address should be readily available. Okay, found it: 1 University Drive, Sheboygan, WI 53081. Right, I need the latitude and longitude. Looking those up... approximately 43.75° N, 87.71° W. Good. Now I have both sets of coordinates. I'm ready for the next step.
