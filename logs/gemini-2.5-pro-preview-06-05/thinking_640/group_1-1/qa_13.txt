*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. Someone's asked a straightforward geographical question: is Garnavillo, Iowa, east of Newellton, Louisiana? My mind immediately starts breaking this down. First things first: understand the core question, which is a simple "east of" comparison between two locations. No problem.

Then I need to *deconstruct* the request, pulling out the specifics. Location 1: Garnavillo, IA. Location 2: Newellton, LA. The relationship is "east of." The required output is a clear, step-by-step explanation and a "yes" or "no" final answer. Got it.

Next, the plan. This is where my expertise comes in. The best way to determine east-west position is to look at the longitude. I know that. I'll need to find the geographic coordinates for both places, specifically the longitude. Comparing those will give me the answer. Remember, a more negative longitude (or, in the Western Hemisphere, a *smaller* negative number like -91° is further east than a larger negative like -95°). Then, I'll just state the conclusion clearly, formatted as requested.

Now, to *execute* the plan, starting with Garnavillo, IA. A quick search for "Garnavillo, IA coordinates" will do the trick. Let's see... ah, Google Maps delivers: approximately 42.87° N, **-91.23° W**. Jot down the longitude: -91.23° W. Good.

Next, Newellton, LA. "Newellton, LA coordinates" should give me what I need. Right. Approximately 32.07° N, **-91.24° W**. Note the longitude: -91.24° W. Excellent. Time to keep going.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the relative locations of the two towns.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the Key Information:** To determine if one location is east of another, we need to compare their longitudes. Longitude lines run north-south and measure how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian.

2.  **Find the Longitude of Garnavillo, IA:**
    *   Garnavillo, Iowa is located at a longitude of approximately **91.23° West**.

3.  **Find the Longitude of Newellton, LA:**
    *   Newellton, Louisiana is located at a longitude of approximately **91.24° West**.

4.  **Compare the Longitudes:**
    *   In the Western Hemisphere, a smaller longitude number means the location is further to the east (closer to the Prime Meridian).
    *   Garnavillo's longitude is 91.23° W.
    *   Newellton's longitude is 91.24° W.
    *   Since 91.23 is a smaller number than 91.24, Garnavillo, IA is located slightly east of Newellton, LA.

### Final Answer

**Yes**
