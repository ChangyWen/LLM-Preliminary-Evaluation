*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's my thought process: The user wants a straightforward "yes" or "no" answer regarding the relative north-south position of two ZIP codes, 32751 and 32796. My task is to break down the reasoning.

First things first: I need to figure out where these ZIP codes actually *are*. My internal knowledge tells me 32751 is mostly Maitland, Florida. Okay. 32796... Ah, that's a PO Box ZIP code, right? Gotta be careful. A quick check confirms it's used by the Winter Park, FL, post office. *Crucially, it's the *location* of the PO Box in Winter Park that matters.* Got it.

Now, how do I determine north or south? Step one, I've already done; identify the core geographic areas. Step two: what's their relationship? Maitland versus Winter Park. Step three: visualize this geographically. I picture a map of Central Florida in my head. Orlando is central, and I know both Maitland and Winter Park are just north of Orlando, a pretty close proximity. I need to refine this now. I need to be *certain*. I'll mentally map the area... Maitland is right next to Winter Park. Hmm...
