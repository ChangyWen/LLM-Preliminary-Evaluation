*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to pinpoint the user's *exact* query: they want to know if Cambria County, Pennsylvania, is west of Cattaraugus County, New York. It's a straightforward question, but I need to break it down.

I see two primary entities here: Cambria County, PA, and Cattaraugus County, NY. The crucial relationship is the spatial one - "west of". My output needs to be logical and provide a clear "Yes" or "No" answer, backed up with my reasoning.

To figure this out, I'll need to get the longitude for both counties. Longitude, as any geographer would know, dictates east-west positioning. A more westerly location will always have a higher negative longitude value (or a higher value if using West longitude notation).

So, the next step is data acquisition. For Cambria County, PA, I'll search for the longitude. A quick query suggests around 78.7° W, but let's be accurate. A deeper dive gives me a central point of roughly 40.48° N latitude, -78.72° W longitude.

Next, Cattaraugus County, NY. Again, a quick search hints at a similar longitude, near 78.7° W. I'll need specifics for accuracy. Looks like I'm dealing with a central point around 42.24° N latitude and -78.79° W longitude.

Now the analysis. First, I have to clearly identify the locations: Cambria County, PA, and Cattaraugus County, NY. Then, I need to look at the core metric - longitude. As any spatial analyst is aware, longitude will tell me about their east-west relationship.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the geographical relationship between the two counties.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the two locations:** We need to compare the positions of Cambria County, Pennsylvania, and Cattaraugus County, New York.

2.  **Determine their East-West position using longitude:** A location's east-west position on a map is determined by its longitude. Locations with a more negative longitude (or a higher West longitude value) are farther west.

3.  **Find the longitude of Cambria County, PA:** The approximate central longitude of Cambria County, PA is **-78.72° W**.

4.  **Find the longitude of Cattaraugus County, NY:** The approximate central longitude of Cattaraugus County, NY is **-78.79° W**.

5.  **Compare the longitudes:**
    *   Cambria County, PA: -78.72°
    *   Cattaraugus County, NY: -78.79°

    Since -78.79 is a more negative number than -78.72, Cattaraugus County, NY is located slightly west of Cambria County, PA. Therefore, Cambria County, PA is located **east** of Cattaraugus County, NY.

### Final Answer

No.
