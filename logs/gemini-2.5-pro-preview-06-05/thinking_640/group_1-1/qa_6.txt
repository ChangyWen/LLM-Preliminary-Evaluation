*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's break this down. The user needs a simple "Yes or No" to determine which headline was published first. Alright, I can do that. First, I need to clearly understand the task. They've given me two headlines: "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal" and "Activist Running for Mayor of Moscow Is Briefly Detained." I have to find the publication dates for each and then compare them. This seems pretty straightforward.

So, step one: Find the publication date for "Clock Is Ticking for Recess, and for a Deficit Deal." The phrasing immediately screams US politics. A "deficit deal" and "recess" definitely points to Congressional shenanigans, which means major news outlets like *The New York Times* or *The Washington Post* are the likely sources. Time to formulate a targeted search query. I'll use the exact headline, followed by "publication date."

Alright, search time! The search results... ah, it seems like *The New York Times*. Excellent. Now I need to verify. I'll quickly check the NYT archive or a general web search to confirm the source and date.  Yep.  I've got it: *The New York Times*, published July 26, 2011. And the article is about the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis. Good, good. One down, one to go.
