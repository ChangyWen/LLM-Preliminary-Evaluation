*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I need to figure out which song, "Jimmy James" by the Beastie Boys or "Pull Me Under" by Dream Theater, came out first. This requires a very structured approach.

First, I need to break down the user's request. The core question is a straightforward "earlier than" comparison. The answer has to be definitive: yes or no, preceded by a clear explanation.

Right, time to get to work. I know both bands pretty well. "Jimmy James" is a definite standout from *Check Your Head*. Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under" is, of course, their signature track from *Images and Words*. The key will be pinning down the actual release dates. That means dates for both the album and any single releases, and I suspect there were singles for both.

Okay, first step: I need to find the release date of the Beastie Boys track. I'll start with the album. I'll Google "Beastie Boys Jimmy James release date" to get the ball rolling. That will probably point me to *Check Your Head*, so I'll follow up with a search for "Check Your Head release date". Then I'll need to confirm if "Jimmy James" was also released as a single, and, if so, *when*. That's a crucial detail. Google "Jimmy James Beastie Boys single release date" should tell me. I'll want to confirm those details using a reliable source, like the album's Wikipedia page.

Next, I'll do the same for Dream Theater: find the album release date, and then the single release date for "Pull Me Under". It's all about comparing dates. The earlier date wins. Simple enough, in theory! Let's begin.
