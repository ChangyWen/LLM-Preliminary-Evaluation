*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if Williamsburg, Manhattan, is south of Hillman Houses, Manhattan. My first thought is, *wait a minute, is Williamsburg even in Manhattan?*

1.  **Initial Question:** The core of the problem is to compare these two locations.

2.  **Deconstruction:** Alright, let's look at each one:
    *   **Williamsburg, Manhattan:**  And this is where it gets interesting.  I know Williamsburg is a well-known area.
    *   **Hillman Houses, Manhattan:** This is easy. I know exactly where it is. Hillman Houses is a housing cooperative complex in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, part of Cooperative Village. I need to think about the exact bounds. Grand Street, Lewis Street, East Broadway, and the FDR Drive, approximately. This is a solid Manhattan location.

3.  **Fact-Checking and Addressing the Premise:** The biggest flag is "Williamsburg, Manhattan." Williamsburg is *not* in Manhattan. It's in Brooklyn. That throws a wrench in the whole query because the question itself is based on a false premise. This is the first and most important point to make crystal clear.

4.  **Reframing the Intent:** I'm guessing what the user *really* wants to know is the relative location of Williamsburg *in Brooklyn* compared to Hillman Houses *in Manhattan*. They're probably just mixed up about the boroughs.

5.  **The Step-by-Step Approach:** Here's how I'd respond to make sure it's totally clear:
    *   **Step 1: Hillman Houses Location:** First, I'd confirm that Hillman Houses is in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. It's a housing cooperative, and I'd give the general boundaries around Grand Street and the FDR Drive.
    *   **Step 2: Williamsburg Location:** Crucially, I'd state clearly that Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. This is the clarification that the user needs.
    *   **Step 3: The Comparison:** I'd then explain the geographical relationship: the East River separates Manhattan and Brooklyn. Hillman Houses is in Manhattan, on the west side of the East River. Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, on the east side of the East River. Therefore, *no, Williamsburg is not south of Hillman Houses, Manhattan, as it is not in Manhattan.*

**************************************** Content ***************************************
Here is the step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the location of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan:** Hillman Houses is a housing cooperative located in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. It is situated north of the Manhattan Bridge and south of the Williamsburg Bridge.

2.  **Identify the location of WILLIAMSBURG:** The neighborhood of Williamsburg is located in the borough of **Brooklyn**, not Manhattan. It lies just across the East River from the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

3.  **Compare the two locations:** Since Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, the premise of the question "Is WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan..." is incorrect. However, we can compare the geographical location of the Williamsburg neighborhood (in Brooklyn) to Hillman Houses (in Manhattan). The Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn is generally to the east and slightly north of Hillman Houses in Manhattan, separated by the East River.

### Final Answer

**No.**

The neighborhood of Williamsburg is located in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Therefore, "Williamsburg, Manhattan" does not exist as a location.
