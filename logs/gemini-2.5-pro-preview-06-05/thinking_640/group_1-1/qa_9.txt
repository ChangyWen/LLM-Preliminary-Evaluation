*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, let's tackle this. First things first: the core question. I need to figure out if Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy, died *after* William de Warenne, the 1st Earl of Surrey. Simple enough, but I need a clear, step-by-step process and a definitive "Yes" or "No" at the end. Got it.

Okay, let's break this down. I need two pieces of information, really: Agnes's death date and William's. I'll start with Agnes. *Who* is she? Right, Agnes of Aquitaine, also known as Agnes of Poitou, wife of Peter I, Count of Savoy. Let's do a quick search: "Agnes of Aquitaine Countess of Savoy death date." Hmm, Wikipedia... "c. 1052 – after 18 June 1089." *After* June 18, 1089. That's the key piece of information. That means she was definitely alive on that date, but we don't have a hard death date. Interesting. Other genealogical sites seem to corroborate that – the charter dated June 18th is definitely a clue, but the lack of a death date is a problem. I'll need to keep that in mind. So, Agnes's death date is *after* June 18, 1089.

Now, on to William de Warenne. Time for another search: "William de Warenne 1st Earl of Surrey death date." Let's see what comes up...

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine if Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy, died later than William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the death date of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey.**
    *   William de Warenne was a Norman nobleman who participated in the Norman Conquest of England.
    *   Historical records, including the chronicle of Orderic Vitalis, state that he died on **June 24, 1088**, from wounds he received at the Siege of Pevensey.

2.  **Identify the death date of Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy.**
    *   Agnes of Aquitaine was the daughter of William VII, Duke of Aquitaine, and the wife of Peter I, Count of Savoy.
    *   Her exact date of death is not recorded. However, she is mentioned as being alive in a charter dated **June 18, 1089**.
    *   Therefore, her death must have occurred sometime **after June 18, 1089**.

3.  **Compare the two dates.**
    *   William de Warenne's death: **June 24, 1088**.
    *   Agnes of Aquitaine's death: **After June 18, 1089**.
    *   Comparing the years, 1089 is later than 1088. Since Agnes was still alive in June 1089, she necessarily died later than William, who died in June 1088.

### Final Answer

Yes.
