*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, let's see... the question is, was *Summertime* by Coetzee released *before* *Catching Fire* by Collins? That's the core. Now, to answer that, I need some concrete facts. I need to know the release dates of both books. No problem, this is straightforward.

Okay, first step: find the release date of Coetzee's *Summertime*.  Let's Google "J.M. Coetzee Summertime release date". Hmm, looks like August 2009. Specifically, it was first published in Australia in August 2009, then in the UK and US. Okay, I'll go with August 2009 for simplicity.

Next, *Catching Fire*: "Suzanne Collins Catching Fire release date".  Yep, that's always going to be September 1, 2009.

Right, now I have the dates: *Summertime* is August 2009, and *Catching Fire* is September 1, 2009. Easy enough. August comes before September. Therefore, Coetzee's *Summertime* was published *before* Collins's *Catching Fire*. Done.

1.  **Find the release date of J. M. Coetzee’s *Summertime*.**
    *   J. M. Coetzee's novel *Summertime* was first published in Australia in August 2009.

    *   Suzanne Collins's novel *Catching Fire*, the second book in *The Hunger Games* trilogy, was published on September 1, 2009.

3.  **Compare the two dates.**
    *   *Summertime* was released in August 2009.
    *   *Catching Fire* was released in September 2009.
