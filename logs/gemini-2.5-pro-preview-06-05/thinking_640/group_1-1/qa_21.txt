*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I'm being asked a pretty straightforward question: is the "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" east of the "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO"? My gut reaction? They're the same thing. But let's be certain, let's follow a proper thought process to make sure my initial hunch is correct and give a well-reasoned answer.

First, I need to *define the terms.* I'll break down the question and really understand what's being asked.

Okay, **Step 1: Define the terms.** That means I need to know exactly what the "Sangre de Cristo Range" is and what the "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" *are*.

Based on my internal knowledge base of geography and orography:

*   **"Sangre de Cristo Mountains"**: This is the *primary* and most commonly accepted name. They're a major mountain range, a significant feature within the larger Rocky Mountains system. They extend from south-central Colorado down into northern New Mexico. I visualize them.

*   **"Sangre de Cristo Range"**: This is the crucial point. This *is* simply an *alternative* name for the very *same* mountain system. Think of it like calling the "Rocky Mountains" a "Rocky Mountain Range." The terms "range" and "mountains" are frequently used interchangeably when discussing such large-scale mountain systems.

**Step 2: Compare the definitions.** This is crucial, are they different entities? Do they refer to the same geographical feature? My definitions confirm that the Sangre de Cristo Range and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains *are* the same feature, same geographical area.

**Step 3: Address the spatial relationship.** Given my assessment, is it even *possible* for one to be "east of" the other? If they're the same thing, then the question relies on a flawed assumption. This isn't a spatial relationship; it's a matter of nomenclature.

**Step 4: Synthesize information and provide a final answer.** Knowing that the "Sangre de Cristo Range" and the "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" refer to the same geographical entity, the answer is a definitive "No". They are the same mountain system and therefore cannot be positioned relative to each other. The question is based on a misunderstanding.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the Geographic Features:** The two names in question are "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO" and "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO".

2.  **Define the Terms:** We need to determine if these are two separate, distinct geographical features or different names for the same feature.
    *   The **Sangre de Cristo Mountains** are a major mountain range of the Rocky Mountains, running from south-central Colorado into northern New Mexico. This is the most common and official name for the entire mountain system.
    *   The term **Sangre de Cristo Range** is used interchangeably with "Sangre de Cristo Mountains." In geography, "range" and "mountains" are often used to describe the same large landform.

3.  **Compare the Features:** The "Sangre de Cristo Range" and the "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" refer to the exact same geographical entity in Colorado. They are not two separate parallel ranges where one could be east of the other.

4.  **Conclusion:** Since both names describe the same single mountain range, one cannot be located east of the other. The question is based on a false premise that they are two different places.

***

### Final Answer

**No.**

The Sangre de Cristo Range is not located east of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains because they are two different names for the exact same mountain range.
