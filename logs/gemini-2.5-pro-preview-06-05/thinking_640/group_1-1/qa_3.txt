*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, let's break this down. The core question is straightforward: did *Nightmare Honeymoon* come out *after* *Gold*? Simple enough. I need to compare their release dates.

First things first, let's clarify the players. *Nightmare Honeymoon*, directed by Elliot Silverstein, versus *Gold*, directed by Peter R. Hunt. The question, essentially, boils down to a temporal comparison: Is *Nightmare Honeymoon*'s release date later than *Gold*'s?

Now, for the nitty-gritty, the data gathering. Step one: *Nightmare Honeymoon*. A quick search – "Elliot Silverstein Nightmare Honeymoon release date" – should do the trick. Right off the bat, Wikipedia, IMDb, and the AFI Catalog all point to December 1974. Okay, that's clear. *Nightmare Honeymoon* was released in December of '74.

Next, *Gold*. Another quick search: "Peter R. Hunt Gold movie release date." Immediately, Wikipedia and IMDb show a bit of complexity. They list different release dates: September 1974 in the UK, and November 1974 in the US. The BFI confirms the UK release date. So, we have *Gold* released in September 1974 (UK) or November 1974 (US).

Given that *Nightmare Honeymoon* was released in December 1974, and *Gold* was released in either September or November 1974, the answer is no. *Nightmare Honeymoon* was *not* released later than *Gold*.
