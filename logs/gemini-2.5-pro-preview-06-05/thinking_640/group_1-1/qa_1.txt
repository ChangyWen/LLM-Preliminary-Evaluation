*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know if one book is shorter than another, specifically *The Abolition of Britain* versus *Birdman*. My job is to figure this out methodically and explain my reasoning.

First, I need to dissect the request. What does "shorter" even *mean*? Well, in book terms, that pretty much always boils down to page count. Word count would be ideal for ultimate precision, but it's rarely accessible off the bat, and audiobook length is variable based on the narrator. Page count is the universal go-to.

So, I'll need the page counts for both books. Where to find that information? Hmm… Goodreads is usually my first stop – it's generally pretty reliable, but I need to double-check for different editions. Publisher websites are another good source, and online booksellers like Amazon or Barnes & Noble often have the details in the product description. Wikipedia *could* work, but I'd definitely cross-reference with something more official.

Alright, plan of action: Step 1: Identify the books – *The Abolition of Britain* by Peter Hitchens, and *Birdman* by Mo Hayder. Done. Now, Step 2: find the page count for *The Abolition of Britain*. I'll Google "The Abolition of Britain page count" and also try a more specific search like "Peter Hitchens The Abolition of Britain Goodreads". Let's see what Goodreads has to say. Okay, a few editions… The original 1999 paperback has 344 pages. Later editions from 2000 and 2018 show 368 pages. Alright, I'll keep that in mind as I move forward, noting the variations.

3.  **Find the Page Count for *Birdman***:

    *   The most common mass-market paperback edition of *Birdman* is listed by its publisher (Bantam) and major booksellers as having **480 pages**.

4.  **Compare the Page Counts**:
    *   *The Abolition of Britain*: 368 pages
