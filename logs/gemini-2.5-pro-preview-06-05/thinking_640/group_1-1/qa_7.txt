*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, let's get this straight. The question is straightforward: did Anastasia of Sirmium live longer than William II, Count of Chalon? Seems simple enough. My process starts with breaking down the request into manageable pieces, as usual.

First, I need to identify and separate the individuals. We've got Anastasia, the subject, and William II, the reference. Then comes the work: finding the birth and death dates for each. After that, I'll calculate their lifespans, compare them, and give a definitive "Yes" or "No" answer. That’s the plan.

So, let's start with Anastasia. A quick search should get me going. Ah, yes, she's a Christian saint and martyr. The typical problem with these early figures – the exact birth date is a bit hazy. Sources generally place her in the 3rd century. Her death, however, is well-documented, around 304 AD during the Diocletianic Persecution. Now, the lack of a birth year presents a significant problem. I can't calculate her lifespan precisely. This is already a major stumbling block.

Next, William II, Count of Chalon. Searching for him... Ah, a French nobleman. His birthdate appears to be around 1170. The death date is much clearer: 1203. Calculating his lifespan is easy enough; 1203 minus 1170 gives me roughly 33 years.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine who lived longer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the individuals and their vital dates:**
    *   **Anastasia of Sirmium:** She was a Christian saint and martyr. Her exact birth year is unknown, which is common for figures from that era. However, historical records place her death in or around the year **304 AD** during the Diocletianic Persecution.
    *   **William II, Count of Chalon:** He was a French nobleman. His birth year is estimated to be around **1170 AD**, and he died in **1203 AD**.

2.  **Calculate the lifespan of William II, Count of Chalon:**
    *   Death Year: 1203
    *   Birth Year: ~1170
    *   Lifespan: 1203 - 1170 = **approximately 33 years**.

3.  **Analyze the lifespan of Anastasia of Sirmium:**
    *   Since Anastasia's birth year is unknown, we cannot calculate her exact age at death. However, we know she was an adult at the time of her martyrdom in 304 AD. To have lived longer than William II, she would have needed to be older than 33 at the time of her death.
    *   Historical accounts describe her as a married noblewoman who was active in her faith and ministry to other Christians. This implies she was not a child and had reached adulthood. It is highly probable she was older than 33, but it cannot be proven with a precise calculation.

4.  **Compare the lifespans:**
    *   William II's lifespan is definitively short, at around 33 years.
    *   Anastasia's lifespan is unknown. We cannot mathematically prove that her lifespan was greater than 33 years.

5.  **Conclusion:**
    *   Because we lack a birth year for Anastasia of Sirmium, it is impossible to perform a direct calculation and definitively state that she lived longer than William II, Count of Chalon. Any answer would be based on speculation rather than historical fact.

### Final Answer

**No.**

It is not possible to confirm that Anastasia of Sirmium lived longer than William II, Count of Chalon, because her birth year is unknown.
