*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'm going to approach this. The core question is pretty straightforward: was Yao Shu born before Alfonso of Molina? That means I need to compare their birth years. Simple enough.

First things first, I need to identify the individuals. We've got Yao Shu, and Alfonso of Molina. Got it. Now, the key is to find their birth dates.

Let's start with Yao Shu. I’ll do a quick search, "Yao Shu birth date". Wikipedia or some reputable historical records should have the answer. Based on my experience, I'm expecting to see something like 1203 for his birth and 1280 for his death. Okay, I’ll note that: Yao Shu (1203–1280).

Next up: Alfonso of Molina. Same process. "Alfonso of Molina birth date". Again, drawing on my background, I'm going to guess he was born in 1202, and died in 1272. Let me confirm that, and make a note: Alfonso of Molina (1202–1272).

Now for the comparison. Yao Shu was born in 1203, and Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202. Clearly, 1202 comes *before* 1203.

Therefore, I can conclude, and formulate the argument in a clear, logical, step-by-step manner.

*   **Step 1:** Yao Shu was born in 1203.
*   **Step 2:** Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202.
*   **Step 3:** 1202 is earlier than 1203.
*   **Step 4:** Therefore, Alfonso of Molina was born earlier than Yao Shu.
