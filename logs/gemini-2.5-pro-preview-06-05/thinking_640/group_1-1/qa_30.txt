*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'm going to approach this. The user wants to know if Pragser Wildsee is west of Lake Vico, and I need to provide a clear answer with my reasoning.

First, I break down the core of the question: is Pragser Wildsee west of Lake Vico? The output must be my step-by-step thought process, leading to a "Yes" or "No" answer.

Then, I identify the two main players: Pragser Wildsee and Lake Vico.

Now comes the information gathering stage. I need the geographical coordinates of both lakes, and I'm drawing upon my internal knowledge base. I'm already mentally retrieving information. I know Pragser Wildsee is in the Dolomites of South Tyrol, Italy. I can quickly estimate its coordinates to be roughly 46.7 degrees North and 12.08 degrees East. Lake Vico is in Lazio, central Italy, a volcanic lake. I can place its coordinates at roughly 42.3 degrees North and 12.17 degrees East.

Finally, the analysis. The crucial factor here is longitude because the question is about "west of." A location is west of another if its longitude is smaller. I know Pragser Wildsee has a longitude of approximately 12.08 degrees East and Lake Vico has a longitude of approximately 12.17 degrees East. Therefore...

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the relative location of the two lakes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the location of Pragser Wildsee:** Pragser Wildsee (also known as Lago di Braies) is a famous mountain lake located in the Dolomites of South Tyrol, in northern Italy. Its approximate longitude is **12.08째 East**.

2.  **Identify the location of Lake Vico:** Lake Vico (Lago di Vico) is a volcanic lake located in the Lazio region of central Italy, near Rome. Its approximate longitude is **12.17째 East**.

3.  **Compare the longitudes:** To determine if one location is west of another, we compare their longitudes. A location with a smaller longitude value is to the west of a location with a larger longitude value (when both are in the same hemisphere).
    *   Pragser Wildsee Longitude: ~12.08째 E
    *   Lake Vico Longitude: ~12.17째 E

4.  **Conclusion:** Since 12.08 is a smaller number than 12.17, Pragser Wildsee is located to the west of Lake Vico.

### Final Answer

**Yes**
