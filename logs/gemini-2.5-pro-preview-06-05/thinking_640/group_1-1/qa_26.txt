Okay, here's how I'm going to tackle this. The user wants to know if ZIP code 98580 in Washington is west of 97233 in Oregon. Straightforward enough. My approach is going to be methodical, as always.

First, I'll break down what's being asked: the core of the question is a spatial comparison, "west of." My output needs to be a clear "Yes" or "No," supported by my reasoning.

I've got the initial data points: 98580, WA and 97233, OR. I know the states, which is crucial. Washington and Oregon are adjacent, which gives me some immediate context.

Now, for my plan. I'll need to locate these ZIP codes. My preferred method would be a quick look-up within my knowledge base to identify the cities/areas. Once I know the locations, I'll then compare longitudes, which is the definitive way to determine "west of." Negative longitude values indicate westward positions. The whole process should be clearly articulated for the user. After comparing longitudes, I'll give the definitive answer.

Time to execute the plan. I'll start with the first step, identifying the locations. First up, I'll look up the location for 98580, WA. The query is: "What city is ZIP code 98580, WA?" And my result is: Rochester, Washington.
