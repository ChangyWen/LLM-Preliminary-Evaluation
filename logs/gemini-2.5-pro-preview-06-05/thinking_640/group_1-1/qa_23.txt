Okay, let's break this down. The user's asking about relative locations: Is Pine Flat Dam in California east or west of St. Mary's Church in Nevada? Simple enough, but I need to be thorough, as always. My response needs to be clear and, more importantly, *correct*.

First things first: what am I actually trying to *do*? Figure out a spatial relationship and then present the answer along with the logic. Easy. The core of the question is comparative: are we talking east or west?

I immediately think, *California and Nevada*. Classic US geography. I know California is generally *west* of Nevada. That's just basic knowledge from years of studying maps and understanding spatial relationships. However, I can't just leap to a conclusion based on generalities. State boundaries aren't perfectly straight. The California/Nevada border isn't a perfect north-south line; there are complexities, particularly with the angle of the border. I have to be certain.

My immediate thought is, to answer this *definitively*, I need precise data. I need coordinates. Forget rough guesses and estimates. Latitude and longitude are the key. Because I know the fundamental principles of how these coordinate systems work. I'm really interested in *longitude*. Longitude lines run north-south, and it’s the *longitude value* that dictates east-west positioning. The further west you go, the *bigger* the negative longitude number gets. So I'll be looking at those figures, and it's pretty much a dead giveaway.

So, first step: get the coordinates for Pine Flat Dam. I'll use a search query like "Pine Flat Dam CA coordinates," or "Pine Flat Dam CA longitude." The output I expect: a latitude and longitude pair, something along the lines of: Latitude 36.83° N, Longitude -119.32° W. Now, let's find those and see what we get!

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the relative locations of Pine Flat Dam, CA, and St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the Geographic Coordinates of Each Location:** To determine if one location is east or west of another, we need to compare their longitudes. Longitude lines run north-south, measuring how far east or west a point is from the Prime Meridian. In the Western Hemisphere (which includes the United States), a more negative longitude value means the location is farther west.

2.  **Find the Longitude of Pine Flat Dam, CA:**
    *   Pine Flat Dam is located on the Kings River in Fresno County, California.
    *   Its approximate longitude is **-119.32° W**.

3.  **Find the Longitude of St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV:**
    *   This historic church is located in Virginia City, Nevada.
    *   Its approximate longitude is **-119.65° W**.

4.  **Compare the Longitudes:**
    *   Pine Flat Dam, CA: -119.32° W
    *   St. Mary's Church, NV: -119.65° W

    When comparing these longitude values on a map, the number -119.32 is less negative (or "greater") than -119.65. A less negative longitude value in the Western Hemisphere indicates a position that is farther to the **east**.

5.  **Conclusion:** Since -119.32° W (Pine Flat Dam) is east of -119.65° W (St. Mary's Church), Pine Flat Dam is located east of the church.
