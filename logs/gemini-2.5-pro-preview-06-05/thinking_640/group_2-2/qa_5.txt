Okay, here's how I'd approach this. First, I need to break down the user's question. They want to know if Australia is bigger than Russia, but they also want the *reasoning* behind the answer. That means I can't just blurt out "No." I need to show my work.

So, step one is to define the problem: comparing the land areas of Australia and Russia.  My brain immediately pulls up some prior knowledge: Russia is huge, the biggest country in the world, and Australia is also vast, a continent-country.  That tells me *the answer is likely "No"*. But I need to prove it.

Next, I need to find the actual figures.  For Russia, I need the most up-to-date, authoritative source for its *total area* – land and water combined.  I'll run a quick internal search: "Russia area." Based on that, I'm estimating around 17.1 million square kilometers, or about 6.6 million square miles.  I should probably include both units to be thorough.

Now, I'll do the same for Australia: "Australia area." I know it's significantly smaller.  The search results suggest it’s approximately 7.7 million square kilometers, or 3 million square miles.  Again, both units for clarity.

Finally, and this is the heart of it, I'll compare the numbers.  Clearly, 17.1 million square kilometers (or 6.6 million square miles) is larger than 7.7 million square kilometers (or 3 million square miles). Therefore, Russia is larger.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Identify the core question.**
The question is to determine which country, Australia or Russia, has a larger total area.

**Step 2: Find the total area of Russia.**
Russia is the largest country in the world by land area. Its total area is approximately:
*   **17,098,246 square kilometers** (or 6,601,670 square miles).

**Step 3: Find the total area of Australia.**
Australia is the world's sixth-largest country and is also a continent. Its total area is approximately:
*   **7,692,024 square kilometers** (or 2,969,907 square miles).

**Step 4: Compare the two areas.**
Now, we compare the figures from Step 2 and Step 3.
*   Russia's Area: ~17.1 million km²
*   Australia's Area: ~7.7 million km²

By direct comparison, 17,098,246 is significantly larger than 7,692,024. In fact, Russia is more than twice the size of Australia.
