*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking, going through this question like a pro. The user wants to know if blue light's wavelength is longer than red light's. Straightforward enough, but let's lay it out methodically.

First, I break down the task. I need a clear "yes" or "no" answer, but more importantly, the reasoning. This isn't just a simple fact recall; I've got to explain my thinking.

Alright, let's access the core knowledge. Visible light – it's electromagnetic radiation. And I know the order of the visible spectrum: ROY G BIV. Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. That order *is* the key.  How does that order relate to wavelength?  I've got to connect the dots here.

Okay, I recall that red and violet are at opposite ends. But *which* end corresponds to longer or shorter wavelengths? I mentally visualize the whole EM spectrum. Radio waves – long wavelengths, low energy. Gamma rays – short wavelengths, high energy.  Visible light sits in the middle. Infrared is *below* red in terms of frequency, meaning *longer* wavelength than red. Ultraviolet is *above* violet in terms of frequency, meaning *shorter* wavelength than violet.

Ah, that confirms it. As you move across ROYGBIV, going from red to violet, the wavelength *decreases*. Red has the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum, and violet has the shortest. So, by process of elimination, blue light is *between* red and violet. Therefore, blue light *must* have a shorter wavelength than red light.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Understanding the Visible Light Spectrum:** Visible light is a small part of the broader electromagnetic spectrum. Our eyes perceive different wavelengths within this part as different colors.

2.  **The Order of Colors (ROY G BIV):** A common mnemonic to remember the order of colors in the visible spectrum is **ROY G BIV**, which stands for:
    *   **R**ed
    *   **O**range
    *   **Y**ellow
    *   **G**reen
    *   **B**lue
    *   **I**ndigo
    *   **V**iolet

3.  **Relating Color Order to Wavelength:** This order (ROY G BIV) arranges the colors from the longest wavelength to the shortest wavelength.
    *   **Red light** is at one end of the spectrum and has the **longest** wavelength.
    *   **Violet light** is at the opposite end and has the **shortest** wavelength.

4.  **Comparing Red and Blue:**
    *   In the ROY G BIV sequence, **Red (R)** comes first.
    *   **Blue (B)** comes much later in the sequence.
    *   Since the sequence goes from longest to shortest wavelength, any color appearing before another has a longer wavelength. Therefore, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

5.  **Numerical Values (for confirmation):**
    *   The wavelength of **red light** is approximately **620 to 750 nanometers (nm)**.
    *   The wavelength of **blue light** is approximately **450 to 495 nanometers (nm)**.
    *   Comparing these numbers, 620-750 nm is clearly a larger value than 450-495 nm.

### Final Answer

**No.**

The wavelength of blue light is shorter than that of red light.
