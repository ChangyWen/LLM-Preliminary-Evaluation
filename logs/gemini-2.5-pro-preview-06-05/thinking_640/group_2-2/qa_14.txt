*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's break this down. Here's what I'm thinking:

Right, so the question is pretty straightforward: elephant heart versus blue whale heart. Simple enough, but it requires a structured approach to nail a definitive answer. Here's how I'd tackle it.

First, I need to dissect the user's request. It's a direct question, and I know I need to provide a clear, step-by-step explanation leading to a "Yes" or "No" answer. No fluff, just the facts and the rationale.

Now, my initial thoughts.  *Elephant.* Large, land-based. The heart is probably substantial, maybe around 40 to 50 pounds, I seem to recall.  *Blue whale.* The absolute *biggest* animal. Period. Logic screams that its heart is going to be colossal, easily dwarfing anything else. I seem to recall hearing something about the heart being the size of a car, or at least *approaching* that scale. So, preliminary hunch? No. The elephant's heart is not larger. The blue whale's heart, no contest.

Next, I'll map out my approach for a crystal-clear explanation. I'll break it down into steps for clarity. First, I'll focus on the elephant's heart, and then the whale's. That way, the comparison will be clean and undeniable.

So, Step 1: the elephant. Which type of elephant? African elephants are the biggest land animals, so that's the one to focus on, making the argument as compelling as possible. I need concrete data, the weight of an African elephant's heart is the key metric. Gotta find that. Okay, let's seeâ€¦ a quick search... Ah yes, from memory and a quick mental search, I can confidently estimate around 12 to 21 kg, or 25 to 45 pounds. To keep it easy to grasp, let's go with a typical, easily rememberable number like 40-50 lbs. I should also add something about the physiological demands on an elephant's heart, it's pumping against gravity. Important context, helps explain the sheer size. Good start.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Analyze the Elephant's Heart**

*   The elephant, specifically the African elephant, is the largest land animal on Earth.
*   To pump blood throughout its massive body (weighing up to 15,000 lbs or 6,800 kg), it requires a very large and powerful heart.
*   An adult elephant's heart weighs approximately **12 to 21 kilograms (25 to 45 pounds)**. It is a significant and impressive organ, perfectly adapted for its needs on land.

**Step 2: Analyze the Blue Whale's Heart**

*   The blue whale is the largest animal known to have ever existed on Earth, far surpassing any land animal in size and mass.
*   An adult blue whale can weigh up to 200 tons (400,000 lbs or 181,000 kg).
*   To circulate blood through such an enormous body, it needs the largest heart in the animal kingdom.
*   A blue whale's heart weighs approximately **180 kilograms (400 pounds)**. Some have been recorded weighing even more, close to 600 kg (1,300 lbs). It is roughly the size of a small car or a golf cart.

**Step 3: Compare the Two Hearts**

*   **Elephant Heart Weight:** ~21 kg (~45 lbs)
*   **Blue Whale Heart Weight:** ~180 kg (~400 lbs)

When you compare the figures directly, the blue whale's heart is substantially larger and more massive than the elephant's heart. The blue whale's heart is roughly 9 to 10 times heavier than an elephant's heart.

### Final Answer

**No.**
