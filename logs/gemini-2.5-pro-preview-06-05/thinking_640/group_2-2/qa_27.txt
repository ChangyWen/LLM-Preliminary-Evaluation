*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here’s how I’d approach this. First, I need to understand what the user *really* wants. They're essentially asking a simple comparison: is the boiling point lower than the melting point? I see that they want a detailed explanation, so I need to provide a solid step-by-step answer. That means a clear "Yes" or "No" is required in the end.

I can pull the answer from memory immediately, but that’s not what they're after. So, first, I'll do a quick sanity check to make sure I'm on the right track. Boiling point of water: 100°C, right? Melting point of ice: 0°C. Clearly, 100 isn’t lower than 0. The initial answer is “No”.

Now, to deliver the requested step-by-step reasoning, I'll need a logical structure. Let's break this down. I'll start with a solid foundation: defining the terms. That way, there’s no ambiguity. Then, I'll state the values and compare them. Finally, I'll draw a clear conclusion.

Let me elaborate on each step.

*   **Step 1: Define the terms.**
    *   **Melting Point:** This is where a solid changes into a liquid. In the case of ice, this is the point where solid H₂O becomes liquid H₂O. It’s all about phase transitions, and it’s key to remember that energy is *added* to cause this, but the temperature itself doesn't change during the transition.
    *   **Boiling Point:** This is the point where a liquid becomes a gas. For water, this is where liquid H₂O becomes steam. 

Okay, with those definitions in place, I'm ready to move on to the next steps.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Define the "Melting Point of Ice"**

The melting point is the specific temperature at which a substance changes its state from a solid to a liquid. For ice (the solid form of H₂O), this is the temperature at which it melts and becomes liquid water.

*   At standard atmospheric pressure, the melting point of ice is **0° Celsius (0°C)** or **32° Fahrenheit (32°F)**.

**Step 2: Define the "Boiling Point of Water"**

The boiling point is the specific temperature at which a substance changes its state from a liquid to a gas (or vapor). For water (the liquid form of H₂O), this is the temperature at which it boils and becomes steam.

*   At standard atmospheric pressure, the boiling point of water is **100° Celsius (100°C)** or **212° Fahrenheit (212°F)**.

**Step 3: Compare the Two Temperatures**

Now, let's compare the numerical values we have identified.

*   **Using Celsius:** Is 100°C (boiling point) lower than 0°C (melting point)? No, 100 is a much higher number than 0.
*   **Using Fahrenheit:** Is 212°F (boiling point) lower than 32°F (melting point)? No, 212 is a much higher number than 32.

**Step 4: Formulate the Conclusion**

To make ice melt, you must add heat to raise its temperature *to* 0°C. To make that resulting water boil, you must add much more heat to raise its temperature all the way *up to* 100°C. Therefore, the boiling point of water is significantly higher than the melting point of ice.

### Final Answer

**No.**
