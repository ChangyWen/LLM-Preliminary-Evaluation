*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to figure out the central question: Did Newton die *after* Einstein? It's pretty straightforward, actually. Let's break it down: We're comparing two individuals, Newton and Einstein, specifically focusing on their dates of death. The core is whether Newton's death date comes *later* than Einstein's. Got it.

Now, the plan. I need to do a step-by-step comparison:

1.  Find Newton's death date.
2.  Find Einstein's death date.
3.  Compare those dates.
4.  Formulate a "yes" or "no" answer.
5.  Then, I'll write it all out neatly as requested.

Okay, execution time. Let's see...

Step 1: Newton's death. Ah yes, my mental databank pulls that up readily. Isaac Newton died in 1727. (I could go further, including the month and even the calendar system used, but for a simple year comparison, that's sufficient. March 31, 1727, Gregorian. Keep it simple.)

Step 2: Einstein's death. 1955. No problem. April 18, 1955, if we need to be precise. But for the comparison, 1955 is all that matters.

Step 3: Compare the dates. Newton: 1727. Einstein: 1955. Did Newton die after Einstein? Well, no. 1727 is far before 1955.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.

**Step 1: Find the date of Isaac Newton's death.**
Isaac Newton died on March 31, 1727.

**Step 2: Find the date of Albert Einstein's death.**
Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955.

**Step 3: Compare the two dates.**
The year 1727 comes before the year 1955. Therefore, Isaac Newton died before Albert Einstein.

**Final Answer:**
No
