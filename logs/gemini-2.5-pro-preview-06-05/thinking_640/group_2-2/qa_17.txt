*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this. First, I need to break down the user's question. They want to know if Mars has more moons than Earth. Simple enough. The key is a logical process and a definitive answer.

Alright, let's gather the facts. What do I know off the top of my head? Earth's a no-brainer. Earth has *one* moon, our Moon. Now, Mars... I *know* Mars has moons. I'm pretty sure there are two, and their names are Phobos and Deimos. Time to compare. Mars, two moons. Earth, one moon. 2 is greater than 1. The answer is "Yes".

Now, how do I present this clearly? The user specifically wants step-by-step reasoning. I should structure this logically. First, state Earth's moon count. Then, Mars'. Compare those numbers, and then give my conclusion. This will make it clear and concise.

Right. Let's expand on that structure to include the specific details.

*   **Step 1:** Earth. We know Earth has a single natural satellite. I'll even mention it by name to be more specific, "the Moon."
*   **Step 2:** Mars. I need to state Mars has two moons.
*   **Step 3:** Now, let's make a direct comparison.
*   **Step 4:** Based on the comparison, Mars does have more moons than Earth. Simple.

*Before I finalize, I should consider...* do I need to go into the details of near-Earth objects or anything like that? No, it's really asking about natural satellites. Stick to the core, and the response will be solid.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Determine the number of moons Earth has.**
Earth has one natural satellite, which we officially call "the Moon."

**Step 2: Determine the number of moons Mars has.**
Mars has two known natural satellites. Their names are Phobos and Deimos.

**Step 3: Compare the number of moons for each planet.**
*   Earth's moon count: 1
*   Mars's moon count: 2

Comparing these two numbers, 2 is greater than 1.

### Final Answer

Yes.
