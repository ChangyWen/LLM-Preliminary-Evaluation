*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here’s how I’d approach this, in my own head. First things first, I have to really understand what the user is asking. They want a comparison between the Gobi and the Sahara, specifically about which one is hotter. They want a step-by-step breakdown, and a definitive "yes" or "no" at the end. Got it.

Alright, initial thoughts. Sahara… hot, right? Africa, scorching sun, endless dunes. The world’s largest hot desert, everyone knows that. Gobi… that's in Asia, China and Mongolia. I remember it being described as a cold desert. High altitude, rocky terrain, important historically along the Silk Road. My gut says the Sahara is the hotter one, but I need to back that up.

My game plan, then: I'll need a structured approach to nail this down. First, I need to be super precise with my definition of "hotter." What exactly *does* that mean? Highest recorded temperature? Average summer temps? Year-round average? Need to cover all those bases to avoid a misleading answer.

Okay, so now I'll break it down logically: Step 1, defining the terms; Step 2, what's the Sahara really like climatically? Step 3, same thing for the Gobi. Then, Step 4, the direct comparison. And finally, the conclusion, the ultimate yes or no.

I'll need to dive into specifics, too. I'll be looking at those peak summer temperatures, of course, but also average annual temperatures. And, *crucially*, I can't forget about winter temperatures. That's likely where the Gobi's "cold" reputation really shines through. That should highlight the real difference, demonstrating some nuance to avoid being simplistic.

Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which desert is hotter, followed by the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

**Step 1: Define the term "hotter" in the context of deserts.**
To properly compare the two deserts, we can't just look at a single temperature reading. "Hotter" can mean several things:
*   **Higher peak summer temperatures:** Which desert reaches the most extreme high temperatures?
*   **Higher average summer temperatures:** Which desert is consistently hotter during its warm season?
*   **Higher average year-round temperature:** Which desert has a warmer climate overall, factoring in both summer and winter?

We will analyze both deserts based on these three criteria.

**Step 2: Analyze the climate of the Sahara Desert.**
*   **Location and Geography:** The Sahara is a vast subtropical desert in North Africa. It is located at a lower latitude (closer to the equator) and generally has a lower elevation than the Gobi.
*   **Peak Summer Temperatures:** The Sahara is famous for its extreme heat. Highs regularly exceed 40°C (104°F) across most of the region in summer. Record high temperatures have been officially recorded at 50-55°C (122-131°F), with some historical claims (like the now-discredited 58°C in Libya) pointing to its extreme heat potential.
*   **Winter Temperatures:** Winters are mild. While temperatures can drop towards freezing at night, daytime temperatures are still cool to warm. It rarely experiences prolonged, deep freezes or significant snowfall, except at its highest mountain peaks.
*   **Overall Climate:** The Sahara is the world's largest **hot desert**. Its climate is driven by its subtropical location, leading to hot, dry conditions year-round.

**Step 3: Analyze the climate of the Gobi Desert.**
*   **Location and Geography:** The Gobi is a large desert region in East Asia, spanning parts of Northern China and Southern Mongolia. It is located at a much higher latitude (further from the equator) and sits on a high-altitude plateau, averaging 910–1,520 meters (2,990–4,990 ft) above sea level.
*   **Peak Summer Temperatures:** Summers in the Gobi can be hot. Temperatures can reach and sometimes exceed 40°C (104°F). However, these extreme highs are generally not as widespread or sustained as in the Sahara.
*   **Winter Temperatures:** This is the key difference. The Gobi is a **cold desert**. Its high latitude and altitude expose it to frigid air from Siberia. Winter temperatures plummet dramatically, often reaching -30°C to -40°C (-22°F to -40°F). Frost and even snow are common.
*   **Overall Climate:** The Gobi is a desert of extremes, with hot summers and brutally cold winters. This massive temperature swing between seasons significantly lowers its average year-round temperature.

**Step 4: Compare the two deserts directly.**
*   **Peak Summer Heat:** The Sahara Desert consistently records higher and more widespread extreme summer temperatures than the Gobi. While the Gobi gets hot, the Sahara is hotter at its peak.
*   **Average Summer Temperature:** The Sahara's summer season is longer and, on average, hotter than the Gobi's.
*   **Average Year-Round Temperature:** This is the most significant difference. The Gobi's intensely cold winters drag its average annual temperature down drastically. The Sahara's mild winters keep its annual average much higher. The Gobi's average annual temperature can be close to freezing, while the Sahara's is comfortably warm.

### Final Answer

**No.**

The Sahara Desert is significantly hotter than the Gobi Desert. While the Gobi experiences hot summers, it is classified as a cold desert due to its extremely cold winters, which the Sahara does not experience.
