*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to fully understand what the user is asking – the core question is clear: which is taller, K2 or Everest? Then I need to create a detailed explanation to answer the question.

My internal knowledge base just pinged! "Everest" is the tallest mountain. And "K2" is the second highest. So, I already know the answer is "No, K2 is not taller."

Now, I need to go into detail and back this up with hard numbers. What specific data do I need to validate this? I need the official elevations of each mountain, and I have to make sure the data is from a reputable source.

I know Everest is about 8,848.86 meters – that’s the most current measurement from the Nepal-China joint survey in 2020, which is important to note for authority – and roughly 29,031.7 feet. K2 is approximately 8,611 meters, or 28,251 feet.

Okay, so I have the core facts, but I need to structure this logically, right?

I should start with a clear goal: to compare their heights. This will frame the answer. Then, I'll provide the official elevation of Mount Everest, in both meters and feet.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

**Step 1: Identify the official height of Mount Everest.**
Mount Everest is the most famous mountain in the world, and its height has been measured multiple times. The most recent and widely accepted official elevation, established by a joint survey by China and Nepal in 2020, is:
*   **8,848.86 meters** (29,031.7 feet) above sea level.

**Step 2: Identify the official height of K2.**
K2, also known as Mount Godwin-Austen or Chogori, is the second-highest mountain in the world. Its accepted official elevation is:
*   **8,611 meters** (28,251 feet) above sea level.

**Step 3: Compare the two heights.**
Now, we compare the numerical values of their elevations:
*   Height of Mount Everest: 8,848.86 meters
*   Height of K2: 8,611.00 meters

Comparing these two numbers, 8,848.86 is greater than 8,611.

**Step 4: Calculate the difference.**
To understand the scale of the difference, we can subtract the height of K2 from the height of Mount Everest:
*   8,848.86 m - 8,611 m = **237.86 meters**

This shows that Mount Everest is significantly taller than K2 by approximately 238 meters (or 781 feet).

### Final Answer

No.
