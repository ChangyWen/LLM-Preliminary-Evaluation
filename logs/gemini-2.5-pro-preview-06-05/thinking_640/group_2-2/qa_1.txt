*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know if an elephant is heavier than a blue whale. Easy enough, let's break it down. The request is for a reasoned, step-by-step answer, and a definitive "yes" or "no" at the end. Simple.

First, let's get some facts straight. I need to pull up some reliable numbers from my knowledge base.

For the elephant, I know they are the largest land animals. My internal estimates put their weight in the several-ton range. I should probably specify the African bush elephant, since that's the biggest species. Let's get the figures right: I'd say a range of about 4 to 6 metric tons on average, with some large males hitting 10 metric tons. Just to keep things clear, I should give the values in both kilograms and pounds. So that’s roughly 4,000 to 6,000 kg, or 8,800 to 13,200 lbs for the average, and up to 10,000 kg or 22,000 lbs for a really big male.

Next, the blue whale. They are *the* largest animals on Earth, which immediately makes me lean towards "no" as an answer. Still, the numbers are critical. They’re *massive*! I remember seeing figures like 100 tons or more. Let's pin down a specific range. I seem to recall an average adult blue whale weighing somewhere between 100 and 200 tons. I should convert that to kilograms and pounds as well, because those units are super common for easy comparison. So that means 100,000 to 200,000 kg and 200,000 to 400,000 lbs. Alright. Now, to crunch those numbers...

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Identify the weight of an elephant.**
The elephant is the largest land animal on Earth. We need to find its typical weight. The largest species is the African bush elephant.
*   An average adult African elephant weighs between **4 to 6 metric tons** (4,000 to 6,000 kilograms or about 8,800 to 13,200 pounds).
*   Exceptionally large male elephants can weigh up to **10 metric tons** (10,000 kg or 22,000 lbs).

**Step 2: Identify the weight of a blue whale.**
The blue whale is the largest animal on the planet, including all land and sea creatures.
*   An average adult blue whale weighs between **100 to 200 metric tons** (100,000 to 200,000 kilograms or about 220,000 to 440,000 pounds).

**Step 3: Compare the weights.**
Now, let's compare the maximum weight of an elephant to the average weight of a blue whale.
*   **Heaviest Elephant:** ~10 metric tons
*   **Average Blue Whale:** ~150 metric tons (mid-range)

To put this in perspective, an average blue whale weighs about the same as **25 to 30** elephants combined. Even the heaviest elephant ever recorded is only about one-tenth the weight of an average blue whale.

### Final Answer

**No.**
