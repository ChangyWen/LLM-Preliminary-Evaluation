*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here’s what I’m thinking. This is a straightforward question, but the user wants a clear explanation, so I need to break this down meticulously.

First, I need to understand the core question: Does Earth’s gravity have *less* acceleration than the Moon’s? Right away, I know the answer. My gut tells me the Earth’s gravity is far more substantial. Therefore, the answer is “No.”

Next, I must create the reasoning. The user wants a step-by-step explanation. That's the real challenge!

1.  **I need to anchor this in the fundamentals.** Gravity is governed by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. That’s the starting point. The law and the formula *must* be included. I'll write it down, just to be precise.

    *   *Formula:* F = G * (m1 \* m2) / r²

    *   *I'll explain each part, for completeness:*
        *   F is the gravitational force between two objects.
        *   G is the gravitational constant (a constant).
        *   m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects involved (like a planet and an object on its surface).
        *   r is the distance between the centers of those objects, which, in this context, is essentially the radius of the planet or moon.

2.  **Now, how do I relate this to the question of acceleration?** The question asks about "acceleration due to gravity," which is often written as ‘g’.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Final Answer

No.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

The statement "the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is less than that on the Moon" is incorrect. Here is the reasoning why.

**Step 1: Understand the Principle of Gravity**

The force of gravity, and therefore the acceleration it causes, is determined by two main factors: the **mass** of the celestial body (like a planet or moon) and the **distance** from its center (its radius). This relationship is described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.

The formula for the acceleration due to gravity ($g$) on the surface of a celestial body is:

$g = G \frac{M}{r^2}$

Where:
*   $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
*   $G$ is the universal gravitational constant (it's the same everywhere in the universe).
*   $M$ is the mass of the celestial body (e.g., Earth or the Moon).
*   $r$ is the radius of the celestial body.

This formula shows that gravity is stronger (acceleration is higher) for objects with more mass and/or a smaller radius.

**Step 2: Compare the Mass of the Earth and the Moon**

Let's look at the mass of each body.
*   **Mass of Earth ($M_{Earth}$):** approximately 5.97 x 10²⁴ kg
*   **Mass of the Moon ($M_{Moon}$):** approximately 7.34 x 10²² kg

**Comparison:** The Earth is about **81 times more massive** than the Moon. This massive difference in mass is the primary reason Earth's gravity is stronger.

**Step 3: Compare the Radius of the Earth and the Moon**

Now let's look at the radius of each body.
*   **Radius of Earth ($r_{Earth}$):** approximately 6,371 km
*   **Radius of the Moon ($r_{Moon}$):** approximately 1,737 km

**Comparison:** The Earth's radius is about **3.7 times larger** than the Moon's. According to the formula, a larger radius would decrease gravity. However, this effect is far less significant than the effect of Earth's enormous mass.

**Step 4: Calculate and Compare the Acceleration Due to Gravity ($g$)**

Using the values from Steps 2 and 3, we can see the resulting acceleration due to gravity for each.

*   **On Earth:** The combination of its large mass and radius results in an acceleration due to gravity of approximately **9.8 m/s²**. This means a falling object's speed increases by 9.8 meters per second every second.

*   **On the Moon:** The Moon's smaller mass and smaller radius result in an acceleration due to gravity of approximately **1.62 m/s²**.

**Conclusion**

Comparing the two values:

**9.8 m/s² (Earth) > 1.62 m/s² (Moon)**

The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is approximately **6 times greater** than the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon. Therefore, the initial statement is false.
