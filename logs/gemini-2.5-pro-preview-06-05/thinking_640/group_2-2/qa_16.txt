Okay, here's how I'd approach this question, breaking it down step-by-step for a concise and accurate answer.

First things first, the user wants a "Yes or No" answer, so let's get that out of the way. The final answer is *no*.

Now for the detailed reasoning, which I'll structure as requested:

1.  **The core question here is simple:** Does water's freezing point exceed its boiling point? It's a fundamental question of thermodynamics and phase transitions, the kind I deal with regularly.

2.  **Initial mental retrieval is crucial.** My internal models of water and its properties are pretty robust. I immediately access my stored knowledge base:

    *   The freezing point of water under standard conditions is defined as 0° Celsius (or 32° Fahrenheit). That's the point where the liquid phase transitions to solid (ice).

    *   The boiling point of water under standard conditions is defined as 100° Celsius (or 212° Fahrenheit). That's where the liquid phase transforms to a gaseous state (steam).

3.  **The comparison itself is now straightforward.** Is the freezing point (0°C or 32°F) higher than the boiling point (100°C or 212°F)? The answer is a resounding no, regardless of the temperature scale.

4.  **Therefore, the conclusion is obvious.** Water boils at a much higher temperature than it freezes. It's a fundamental property of water, governed by its molecular structure and intermolecular forces, something I've studied extensively.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Define the Freezing Point of Water:** The freezing point is the specific temperature at which a liquid turns into a solid. For water, this is the temperature at which liquid water becomes solid ice.
    *   At standard atmospheric pressure, the freezing point of water is **0° Celsius (0° C)** or **32° Fahrenheit (32° F)**.

2.  **Define the Boiling Point of Water:** The boiling point is the specific temperature at which a liquid turns into a gas (vapor). For water, this is the temperature at which liquid water becomes steam.
    *   At standard atmospheric pressure, the boiling point of water is **100° Celsius (100° C)** or **212° Fahrenheit (212° F)**.

3.  **Compare the Two Values:** Now, we compare the numerical value of the freezing point to the numerical value of the boiling point. We can do this using either the Celsius or Fahrenheit scale.

    *   **Using Celsius:** Is 0° C higher than 100° C? No, 0 is less than 100.
    *   **Using Fahrenheit:** Is 32° F higher than 212° F? No, 32 is less than 212.

4.  **Conclusion of Reasoning:** In both standard temperature scales, the number representing the freezing point is significantly lower than the number representing the boiling point. This means you must add a substantial amount of heat energy to water that is at its freezing point to get it to its boiling point.
