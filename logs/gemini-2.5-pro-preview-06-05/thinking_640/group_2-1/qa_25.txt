*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. Someone's asking about the Moon's gravity, specifically if it's less than Earth's. My gut reaction is "Yes, of course!" Astronauts bouncing is the giveaway. But I need to be thorough, giving a proper explanation, a step-by-step breakdown, and a definitive answer.

First, I have to deconstruct the request. The core is *is it less?* The required output demands a reasoned explanation and a simple yes or no.

Now, let's pull together what I already know. The Moon's gravity *is* less. The visual of astronauts on the Moon confirms that intuitively. But *why* is it less? I know this hinges on mass and distance - the mass of the celestial body and the distance from its center, specifically its radius. The Moon's mass is significantly less than Earth's. It's also smaller, but that's not the main thing. Actually, a smaller radius *increases* gravity at the surface a bit, but the mass difference overpowers that effect. I need to use the Law of Universal Gravitation to explain this properly.

So, how do I organize this? I'll start with a direct, clear "Yes." It immediately answers the question. Then, I’ll make sure to articulate that the strength of the gravitational acceleration is dictated by mass and radius. But now the *show* begins. I need to bring in the relevant physics. The Law of Universal Gravitation is key for the reasoning. I'll need to write out the equation clearly. Then, since they asked about acceleration, I need to connect the force of gravity with the acceleration due to gravity, *g*. That's all about Newton's Second Law, F=ma. Okay, now I'm ready to build the argument.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of a celestial body (like a planet or a moon) is determined by two primary factors: its **mass** and its **radius**. This relationship is described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.

**Step 1: Understand the Principle of Gravity**

Gravity is the force of attraction between two objects. The strength of this force depends on how massive the objects are and how far apart they are. More mass means more gravity. A larger distance means less gravity.

**Step 2: Identify the Key Formula**

The formula for the acceleration due to gravity ($g$) at the surface of a spherical body is derived from Newton's Law:

$g = \frac{G \cdot M}{r^2}$

Where:
*   $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
*   $G$ is the universal gravitational constant (it's the same everywhere in the universe).
*   $M$ is the mass of the celestial body (the Earth or the Moon).
*   $r$ is the radius of the celestial body.

**Step 3: Compare the Mass of the Earth and the Moon**

We need to look at the mass ($M$) of both bodies.
*   **Mass of Earth:** approximately 5.97 x 10²⁴ kg
*   **Mass of the Moon:** approximately 7.34 x 10²² kg

By comparing these numbers, we can see that the Earth is about **81 times more massive** than the Moon. A much larger mass means the Earth exerts a much stronger gravitational pull.

**Step 4: Compare the Radius of the Earth and the Moon**

Next, we look at the radius ($r$) of both bodies.
*   **Radius of Earth:** approximately 6,371 km
*   **Radius of the Moon:** approximately 1,737 km

The Earth's radius is about **3.7 times larger** than the Moon's. Being smaller, the Moon's surface is closer to its center of mass, which on its own would slightly increase its surface gravity compared to an object of the same mass but a larger radius.

**Step 5: Synthesize the Factors**

Now we put the two factors together.
*   The Earth's **mass** is ~81 times greater, which massively *increases* its surface gravity.
*   The Earth's **radius** is ~3.7 times greater. Because radius is squared in the denominator of the formula ($r^2$), this factor *decreases* Earth's surface gravity by a factor of about 3.7² (or ~13.5).

The effect of the Earth's vastly greater mass far outweighs the effect of its larger radius. The Moon's small mass is the dominant reason its gravity is so much weaker.

**Step 6: Calculate and Compare the Final Values**

Using the formula from Step 2, we get the accepted values for surface gravity:
*   **Acceleration due to gravity on Earth ($g_{Earth}$):**  **~9.8 m/s²**
*   **Acceleration due to gravity on the Moon ($g_{Moon}$):** **~1.62 m/s²**

Comparing these two results, we can see that 9.8 m/s² is significantly greater than 1.62 m/s². In fact, the Moon's surface gravity is only about **1/6th** that of Earth's. This is why astronauts could leap so high on the lunar surface.

### Final Answer

**Yes.**

The acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is less than that on Earth.
