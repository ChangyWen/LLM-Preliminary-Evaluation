*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I need to address this question about the Great Wall and the Berlin Wall, and I need to do it in a way that's both accurate and clear. Let's break it down.

First, I need to understand *exactly* what they're asking. It's a direct comparison of lengths, so I need to focus on those numbers. Now, to answer this with authority, I need to pull some key information from my mental database and double-check it for accuracy.

First up: the Great Wall. I *know* it's immense, a vast network of fortifications, not just one single wall like some might think. I've seen the figures thrown around before: thousands of kilometers, tens of thousands, but I need to be precise. Right away, my mind flashes to the official measurements: the comprehensive length that includes all sections, branches, and defensive works. Let's see... according to the latest surveys, those figures hover around the 21,196-kilometer mark, or roughly 13,170 miles. I’ll be sure to specify that this is the *total* length, including everything, and from the most current sources.

Next up: the Berlin Wall. This is a much more contained structure by comparison. It's a single wall, built to encircle a city. I seem to remember it being in the range of hundreds of kilometers, not thousands. I recall something in the neighborhood of 155 kilometers. I can use this as a starting point for my research and confirmation. This is the kind of data I need to verify to make sure I'm not giving incorrect information.

Okay, I'm almost there. I have my facts ready, now I need to craft the answer step-by-step.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Determine the length of the Great Wall of China.**

*   The Great Wall of China is not a single, continuous wall but a vast network of fortifications, walls, trenches, and natural barriers built over many centuries by different dynasties.
*   According to the most comprehensive survey conducted by China's State Administration of Cultural Heritage, the total length of all sections of the Great Wall ever built is **21,196.18 kilometers (13,170.7 miles)**.

**Step 2: Determine the length of the Berlin Wall.**

*   The Berlin Wall was a concrete barrier system built by East Germany that physically and ideologically divided the city of Berlin from 1961 to 1989.
*   The total length of the barrier system that surrounded West Berlin was approximately **155 kilometers (96 miles)**. This included the concrete wall sections as well as extensive wire mesh fencing and other obstacles.

**Step 3: Compare the two lengths.**

*   **Great Wall of China:** 21,196.18 km
*   **Berlin Wall:** 155 km

To find out how many times longer the Great Wall is, we can divide its length by the length of the Berlin Wall:
21,196.18 km / 155 km ≈ 136.75

This calculation shows that the Great Wall of China is over 136 times longer than the Berlin Wall was. The difference in scale is immense.

### Final Answer

**Yes.**
