*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, let's get this done. The core of this is deceptively simple: Did Einstein die later than Newton? Okay, let's break this down, like any good problem. 

First things first, the **core question** itself: Did Einstein die later than Newton? Got it.

Now, let's **deconstruct** this into manageable chunks. I need the death date for Einstein. And for Newton. Then, a straightforward comparison. Crucially, a clear, logical progression of the reasoning process is needed, and finally, a definitive "Yes" or "No" answer. Excellent.

Time to leverage the **knowledge base**. This is where the magic happens. Okay, let's see.
*   **Einstein:** Born March 14, 1879. Died, and I seem to recall this, April 18, 1955.
*   **Newton:** Born (depending on the calendar, of course, but not relevant here), let's get to the critical bit â€“ March 31, 1727.

Right, that's the raw data. Now, the **reasoning process** demands a clear structure.

So, Step 1: Find Newton's death date. It's March 31, 1727.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the date of Isaac Newton's death.**
    Isaac Newton died on March 31, 1727.

2.  **Identify the date of Albert Einstein's death.**
    Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955.

3.  **Compare the two dates.**
    The year 1955 comes after the year 1727. Therefore, Albert Einstein's death occurred later in time than Isaac Newton's death.

### Final Answer

Yes.
