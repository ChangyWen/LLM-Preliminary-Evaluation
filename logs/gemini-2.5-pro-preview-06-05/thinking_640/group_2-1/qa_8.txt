*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here’s how I'd approach this question. First, I need to really understand the ask – what's the core question, and what's the desired outcome? So:

1.  **Dissecting the Problem:** Alright, the question is fundamentally a comparison: "Is the Sahara hotter than the Gobi?" I need to present a logical, step-by-step argument, arriving at a definitive "yes" or "no." Easy enough.

2.  **Initial Ideas and Keyword Association:** Right, time to start connecting concepts.
    *   **Sahara:** "Africa," "equator-adjacent," "sand dunes," "vast," "always hot." The keywords here scream: *hot desert*, *subtropical*, *low latitude*, *intense heat*.
    *   **Gobi:** "Asia," "China/Mongolia," "cold desert," "seasonal shifts," "snow in winter." I'm thinking: *cold desert*, *temperate*, *high latitude*, *seasonal change*, *winter extremes*.

3.  **Constructing a Logical Argument:** The key is a clear, structured approach. I'll have to break it down logically, using climate factors.

    *   **Step 1: Latitude and Location - The Foundation:** This is *the* place to start. It's fundamental.
        *   **Sahara:** North Africa, basically *on* the Tropic of Cancer (about 23.5° N). This means direct, high-angle sunlight for most of the year. Bingo! That's key to *hot*.
        *   **Gobi:** Central/East Asia, (Mongolia/China). High latitude, around 43° N. This means less direct sunlight, especially during winter. That's a key factor for *cold*.
        *   *Conclusion:* The Sahara's location grants it a solar energy advantage. It’s already primed for being hotter, year-round.

    *   **Step 2: Climate Classification - Solidifying the Picture:** Now I need the science.
        *   **Sahara:** What's its climate classification? …

Of course. Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which desert is hotter, followed by a final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Analyze Geographic Location and Latitude**

*   **Sahara Desert:** Located in North Africa, the Sahara straddles the Tropic of Cancer (approximately 23.5° N latitude). This low-latitude position means it receives direct, high-intensity solar radiation for most of the year, leading to consistently high temperatures.
*   **Gobi Desert:** Located in East Asia (across southern Mongolia and northern China), the Gobi sits at a much higher latitude (approximately 43° N latitude). This more northerly position means the sun's rays strike it at a lower, less direct angle, delivering less energy, especially outside of the summer months.

**Conclusion of Step 1:** The Sahara's equatorial proximity gives it a significant advantage in receiving solar energy, which is the primary driver of heat.

**Step 2: Compare Climate Classifications and Temperature Ranges**

*   **Sahara Desert:** The Sahara is classified as a **hot subtropical desert**. Its climate is characterized by extremely hot summers and mild winters.
    *   **Summer Temperatures:** Average high temperatures consistently range from **40°C to 47°C (104°F to 117°F)**. The highest recorded temperature in Africa (58°C / 136.4°F, though this reading is debated) was in this region.
    *   **Winter Temperatures:** Winters are mild, with daytime temperatures typically around **13°C to 20°C (55°F to 68°F)**. It rarely freezes, except at very high altitudes.

*   **Gobi Desert:** The Gobi is classified as a **cold winter desert** or a **temperate desert**. Its climate is one of extremes, with very hot summers but brutally cold winters.
    *   **Summer Temperatures:** Summers can be very hot, with temperatures often reaching **38°C to 45°C (100°F to 113°F)**, rivaling the Sahara on some days.
    *   **Winter Temperatures:** Winters are frigid due to its high latitude and proximity to the Siberian High-pressure system. Temperatures can plummet to **-40°C (-40°F)**. Snow and frost are common.

**Conclusion of Step 2:** While the Gobi can be extremely hot in the summer, its average year-round temperature is brought down significantly by its intensely cold winters. The Sahara remains hot or warm throughout the entire year.

**Step 3: Synthesize the Findings**

The term "hotter" generally refers to higher average temperatures and more extreme peak heat.

*   **Peak Heat:** Both deserts can experience scorching summer days, but the Sahara's peak temperatures are generally higher and more sustained.
*   **Average Annual Temperature:** The Sahara's average annual temperature is vastly higher than the Gobi's because it does not have a freezing winter season. The Gobi's extreme cold for several months a year makes its overall average much lower.
*   **Consistency of Heat:** The Sahara is consistently hot year-round, whereas the Gobi's heat is only seasonal.

Therefore, based on higher average temperatures, higher peak summer temperatures, and year-round heat, the Sahara is the hotter desert.

### Final Answer

**Yes.**
