*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here’s how I’d approach this question, breaking it down step-by-step. The user wants a clear answer, but also a demonstration of my reasoning, which is perfectly reasonable.

First, let's dissect the core of the request. The key is to answer if Everest is taller than K2. Simple. The user wants to see my thought process and then get a "Yes" or "No". Got it.

Then, let’s dive into the knowledge retrieval and fact-checking phase. My internal database, as a veteran, automatically places Everest at the top of the world and K2 a solid second. This pretty much confirms the answer will be a "Yes" right off the bat, but obviously, that's not enough. I need hard data, and the specifics are key to demonstrating a depth of knowledge. I need the measurements. Everest, let’s see… Yes, 8,848.86 meters, or 29,031.7 feet, measured in 2020, and that’s the most current official height. That's important, especially if the user is a stickler for detail. K2, I recall it's a bit shorter, around 8,611 meters, or 28,251 feet. Right, the numbers confirm the obvious. Everest wins on height.

Okay, now to build the structure. It's got to be easily digestible, so I'll break it down logically, step-by-step, as requested. A numbered list is ideal.

Step 1: Okay, start with the basics: We're comparing Mount Everest and K2. Clear and concise.

Step 2: Now for Everest's dimensions. I’ll state its height and mention the location: Nepal/China border, in the Himalayas. Context is always useful for a solid answer and shows I know my stuff. I’ll give both metric and imperial units.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the Metric for "Taller":** When we ask if one mountain is "taller" than another, we are typically referring to its official elevation, which is the height of its summit above mean sea level.

2.  **State the Official Elevation of Mount Everest:** Mount Everest, located on the border of Nepal and China in the Himalayas, has an officially recognized elevation of **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)**. This is based on a joint survey conducted by Nepal and China, announced in 2020.

3.  **State the Official Elevation of K2:** K2, located on the border of Pakistan and China in the Karakoram Range, has an officially recognized elevation of **8,611 meters (28,251 feet)**.

4.  **Compare the Elevations:**
    *   Mount Everest's height: 8,848.86 meters
    *   K2's height: 8,611.00 meters

    By subtracting K2's height from Mount Everest's height, we can find the difference:
    8,848.86 m - 8,611 m = **237.86 meters** (or about 780 feet).

5.  **Conclusion of Comparison:** The number 8,848.86 is greater than 8,611. This means Mount Everest's summit is higher above sea level than K2's summit. Therefore, Mount Everest is the taller of the two mountains. In fact, it is the tallest mountain on Earth, while K2 is the second tallest.

### Final Answer

**Yes.**
