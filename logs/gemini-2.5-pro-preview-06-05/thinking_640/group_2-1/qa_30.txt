Okay, here’s how I'd approach this. First, I need to break down the question. It’s a simple comparison, but I need to make sure I have a solid framework for the answer. So, what are the key parts? The core question is essentially "Human lifespan vs. Dog lifespan: which is longer?". The response needs to show the reasoning, step-by-step, and give a definitive "yes" or "no." Simple enough.

Next, I'll start with what I already know, and I’ll structure my thinking here. First up, human lifespan. Okay, I know that’s generally in the high 70s, maybe low 80s globally. Of course, that number will fluctuate based on a bunch of factors like the country in question, access to healthcare, gender… all of that. But what I want to do here is to get a recent and reliable global average. I should really look for data from the WHO or the UN; those are the gold standards here. I am betting the average will be around 73 years, give or take.

Now, dogs. This is where it gets more interesting, because it's *not* a single, neat number. Dog lifespans are incredibly variable and depend *heavily* on breed. A Great Dane lives a fraction of the time of, say, a Chihuahua. So I need to account for this.

What factors influence a dog’s lifespan? Breed and size are massive. I will want to show that contrast with examples. Things like genetics, and whether the dog is a purebred versus a mixed breed, also play a role. Mixed-breed dogs often live a bit longer due to this 'hybrid vigor' effect. Also, it’s just like with humans: vet care, nutrition, and their overall lifestyle matter a lot.

So, how do I arrive at an "average" for dogs? Given the inherent variation, I really can't give a single number. I have to give a range. My gut tells me that the general average is a common range, something like 10-13 years. Then I’ll clarify that this is a broad average that covers all breeds. This is critical for clarity.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Determine the average human lifespan.**
The average human lifespan is a well-documented statistic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations, the global average life expectancy at birth is approximately **73 years**. This number can vary based on factors like country, access to healthcare, and lifestyle, but 73 years serves as a reliable global benchmark.

**Step 2: Determine the average dog lifespan.**
A dog's lifespan is not a single number; it varies significantly, primarily based on breed and size.
*   **Small Breeds** (e.g., Chihuahuas, Jack Russell Terriers) often live **14-16 years** or more.
*   **Medium Breeds** (e.g., Beagles, Border Collies) typically live **12-15 years**.
*   **Large and Giant Breeds** (e.g., German Shepherds, Great Danes) have the shortest lifespans, often living only **7-10 years**.

To get a general average for all dogs, we can consider a range that accounts for all these breeds. A widely accepted average lifespan for a dog is between **10 and 13 years**.

**Step 3: Compare the two average lifespans.**
Now, we compare the average lifespan of a human to the average lifespan of a dog.
*   Average Human Lifespan: **~73 years**
*   Average Dog Lifespan: **~10-13 years**

Comparing these two figures, 73 years is substantially longer than 10-13 years. Even if we take the longest-living dog breeds (which can reach 20 years in rare cases) and compare them to the global human average, the human lifespan is still more than three times longer.

### Final Answer

**Yes.**
