*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. This is a straightforward question, but it's vital to be precise.

First, the user wants a clear "Yes" or "No" answer, followed by the reasoning, so that's how I'll structure my response. That means I'll need to identify all of the key components of the question.

My brain immediately pulls up some important facts about Venus: slow, retrograde rotation, thick atmosphere – the usual suspects. And then, bingo! "Day longer than a year" – that's the core of the answer right there. But wait, I need to be careful.

"Day" is the crucial term. I need to be crystal clear. What exactly *is* a "day"? I'll need to differentiate between a sidereal day, which is the planet's true rotational period, and a solar day, which is what we perceive as the "day" based on the Sun's position in the sky. The difference between the two will be key. "Year" is, of course, the orbital period, which I'll also need.

Before I dive into the details of Venus, I need a solid reference point. Earth is the perfect comparison. So I'll lead with the familiar: Earth's sidereal and solar day lengths. That'll set the stage. Then, it's on to the main event: Venus!

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Define what "a day" means for a planet.**

There are two main ways to measure a day:

*   **Sidereal Day:** The time it takes for a planet to complete one full 360-degree rotation on its axis relative to the distant stars. This is the planet's true rotation period.
*   **Solar Day:** The time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky (for example, from one noon to the next). This is what we typically experience as a "day."

**Step 2: State the length of a day on Earth.**

To have a clear baseline for comparison, let's look at Earth's measurements:

*   **Earth's Sidereal Day:** Approximately 23 hours and 56 minutes.
*   **Earth's Solar Day:** Approximately 24 hours.

**Step 3: State the length of a day on Venus.**

Venus is unique because it rotates extremely slowly and in the opposite direction (retrograde rotation) to most other planets in our solar system.

*   **Venus's Sidereal Day:** Approximately **243 Earth days**. This is the time it takes for Venus to spin once on its axis.
*   **Venus's Solar Day:** Approximately **117 Earth days**. Because Venus rotates backward while it orbits the Sun, the time from one sunrise to the next is shorter than its rotation period.

**Step 4: Compare the day lengths.**

Now we compare the values from Step 2 and Step 3.

*   **Comparing Solar Days (what we experience):**
    *   A solar day on Venus is **117 Earth days**.
    *   A solar day on Earth is **1 Earth day** (24 hours).
    *   Clearly, 117 Earth days is much longer than 1 Earth day.

*   **Comparing Sidereal Days (true rotation):**
    *   A sidereal day on Venus is **243 Earth days**.
    *   A sidereal day on Earth is about **1 Earth day** (23h 56m).
    *   Again, 243 Earth days is significantly longer than 1 Earth day.

In fact, a day on Venus is so long that its year (the time it takes to orbit the Sun, which is about 225 Earth days) is shorter than its sidereal day.

### Final Answer

**Yes.** A day on Venus lasts much longer than a day on Earth.
