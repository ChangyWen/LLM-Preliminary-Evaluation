*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let me see... I've got this question about the wavelengths of red and blue light. Let's break this down. First things first: I'm dealing with the electromagnetic spectrum here, and visible light is just a tiny sliver of that. I know this inside and out. I can probably start by sketching it in my mind.

Alright, so the visible spectrum... I immediately picture ROYGBIV, of course. Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. That order is key. Now, the big connection: wavelength. I know, instinctively, that wavelength and energy are inversely related. Longer wavelength means lower energy and frequency, and vice versa. I'm practically breathing this.

So, let's place the colors. Red... Hmm, red is on the "low energy" side. Ah, yes, I think about infrared radiation, which is "below red" on the spectrum and is essentially heat. This means that red is the longest wavelength, lowest energy part of the visible spectrum. And violet... well, that's the high-energy end, right? Ultraviolet is "beyond violet" and causes sunburns, so violet must be the shortest wavelength.

So, I've got red at one end and violet at the other. Blue falls somewhere in between. Therefore, if red is at the long-wavelength end and blue is further along toward the short wavelength end, then the wavelength of red light has to be longer than the wavelength of blue light.

Okay, so I should break it down into some clean steps. First, I can introduce the EM spectrum and how visible light is just a small part of it. Then, I'll go over the colors, ROYGBIV. Finally, I'll explain how energy and wavelength play together and link this relationship back to the colors, and I'll have my answer. Easy.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Understanding the Electromagnetic Spectrum:** Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. This radiation exists across a vast range of wavelengths, known as the electromagnetic spectrum. A small portion of this spectrum is visible to the human eye, and we perceive different wavelengths within this portion as different colors.

2.  **The Order of the Visible Spectrum:** The colors of the visible spectrum always appear in a specific order, which can be remembered by the acronym **ROYGBIV**:
    *   **R**ed
    *   **O**range
    *   **Y**ellow
    *   **G**reen
    *   **B**lue
    *   **I**ndigo
    *   **V**iolet

3.  **Relating Color Order to Wavelength:** This order directly corresponds to the wavelength of the light. The spectrum is arranged from the longest wavelength to the shortest wavelength.
    *   **Red light** is at the beginning of this sequence, meaning it has the **longest wavelength** and the lowest frequency/energy.
    *   **Violet light** is at the end of the sequence, meaning it has the **shortest wavelength** and the highest frequency/energy.

4.  **Comparing Red and Blue Light:**
    *   In the ROYGBIV sequence, Red (R) comes long before Blue (B).
    *   This means that as you move from Red towards Blue, the wavelength decreases.
    *   Therefore, red light has a longer wavelength than blue light.

5.  **Numerical Values (for confirmation):**
    *   The wavelength of **red light** is approximately **620 to 750 nanometers (nm)**.
    *   The wavelength of **blue light** is approximately **450 to 495 nanometers (nm)**.
    *   Comparing these numbers, 620-750 nm is clearly a larger value than 450-495 nm.
