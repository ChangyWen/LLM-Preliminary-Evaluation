*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this. First, I get the user's request - are we comparing Russia and Australia by size? Got it. The core is a simple comparison, but the instructions demand I walk them through the process.

My initial thought?  Russia's enormous. Top spot globally. Australia? Huge too, a continent practically.  But, in the pecking order of landmasses, Russia's the heavyweight champ. The answer *should* be yes, but I need to prove it.  

So, where's the data?  I'll leverage my internal knowledge – gotta be accurate.  First, I'm pulling the "area of Russia."  I get it… around 17 million square kilometers. Then, "area of Australia."  That's smaller… roughly 7.7 million.  

Those numbers cinch it. Russia's *vastly* larger. Now, I need to structure the answer methodically. Step one, let's frame the question and what we're measuring.  I'll say, “To answer this, we'll look at the total area..." Clear and concise.  Next step is to give the data, starting with Russia's size.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Identify the Area of Russia**
First, we need to find the total area of Russia. Russia is the largest country in the world by land area.
*   **Area of Russia:** Approximately **17.1 million square kilometers** (17,098,246 sq km).

**Step 2: Identify the Area of Australia**
Next, we need to find the total area of Australia. Australia is the world's sixth-largest country and is also a continent.
*   **Area of Australia:** Approximately **7.7 million square kilometers** (7,692,024 sq km).

**Step 3: Compare the Two Areas**
Now, we compare the figures from Step 1 and Step 2.
*   Russia's Area: 17.1 million sq km
*   Australia's Area: 7.7 million sq km

By direct comparison, 17.1 million is significantly larger than 7.7 million. In fact, Russia is more than twice the size of Australia (17.1 / 7.7 ≈ 2.2).

### Final Answer

**Yes**, Russia is larger in area than Australia.
