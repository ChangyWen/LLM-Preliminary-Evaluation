*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this. First, I need to really understand what the user is asking. They want a step-by-step breakdown to answer a straightforward question: *Is the melting point of ice lower than the boiling point of water?* Essentially, they're asking for a lesson in basic thermodynamics here, which is fine.

I'll begin by defining my terms.  Melting point is the temperature at which a substance changes from a solid to a liquid, and boiling point is the temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a gas. These are both *phase transitions*. Right, got that down.

Next, I need to state the relevant values.  The melting point of ice is exactly zero degrees Celsius (0°C), which is also 32 degrees Fahrenheit (32°F), or 273.15 Kelvin (273.15 K).  Now, the boiling point of water is one hundred degrees Celsius (100°C), two hundred twelve degrees Fahrenheit (212°F), or three hundred seventy-three point fifteen Kelvin (373.15 K).

Now comes the comparison. I need to compare those values directly.  Zero is less than one hundred, thirty-two is less than two hundred twelve, and two hundred seventy-three point fifteen is less than three hundred seventy-three point fifteen.  It's consistent across all unit systems.

Therefore, the melting point of ice *is* lower than the boiling point of water.  Easy peasy.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Define "Melting Point"**

The melting point is the specific temperature at which a substance changes its state from a solid to a liquid. For water, this is the temperature at which solid ice turns into liquid water.

**Step 2: Identify the Melting Point of Ice**

The melting point of ice at standard atmospheric pressure is:
*   **0 degrees Celsius (°C)**
*   **32 degrees Fahrenheit (°F)**

**Step 3: Define "Boiling Point"**

The boiling point is the specific temperature at which a substance changes its state from a liquid to a gas (or vapor). For water, this is the temperature at which liquid water turns into steam.

**Step 4: Identify the Boiling Point of Water**

The boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure is:
*   **100 degrees Celsius (°C)**
*   **212 degrees Fahrenheit (°F)**

**Step 5: Compare the Two Temperatures**

Now, we compare the melting point of ice to the boiling point of water using the same temperature scale.

*   **Using Celsius:** Is 0°C lower than 100°C? Yes, it is.
*   **Using Fahrenheit:** Is 32°F lower than 212°F? Yes, it is.

In both standard scales, the temperature required to melt ice is significantly lower than the temperature required to boil water.

### Final Answer

**Yes.**
