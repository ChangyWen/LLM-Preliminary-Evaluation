*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a very specific answer: Is the boiling point of water higher than its freezing point? And they want a detailed, step-by-step explanation. That means I need to be crystal clear and provide a logical train of thought.

First, I'll give them the direct answer right away, followed by the reasoning, then a recap to reinforce the conclusion.

My initial thought process involves breaking down the user's request. Okay, the core question is a simple comparison: boiling versus freezing. My mind immediately jumps to keywords: water, boiling point, freezing point, and of course, temperature scales. I need to consider Celsius, Fahrenheit, and maybe even Kelvin. I’m thinking about phase changes too – solid, liquid, gas. The phrase "higher than" is key; it means I'll need to quantify everything.

Now, to structure the response. It’s got to be logical. I'll begin with the answer: *Yes*. Then I'll develop a structured step-by-step explanation to support that.

The first step is foundational: define the terms. What *is* freezing point? It's when liquid water transforms into a solid – ice. And the boiling point? That’s when liquid water becomes steam, a gas. An important point to remember here is that both of these are measured under standard atmospheric pressure.

Next up: numerical values. I need to provide concrete numbers to facilitate comparison. Celsius is the most straightforward for this, scientifically speaking. Freezing point of water is 0°C, and the boiling point is 100°C. Easy. Of course, I'll add Fahrenheit values too. I'll throw in Kelvin for scientific completeness, just to be thorough. I feel this will really hit the mark.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Define the Freezing Point of Water**
The freezing point is the specific temperature at which a substance changes its physical state from a liquid to a solid. For water, this is the temperature at which liquid water turns into solid ice.

**Step 2: Define the Boiling Point of Water**
The boiling point is the specific temperature at which a substance changes its physical state from a liquid to a gas (or vapor). For water, this is the temperature at which liquid water turns into steam.
*(Note: These standard points are measured at a standard atmospheric pressure of 1 atmosphere).*

**Step 3: Assign Numerical Values to Each Point**
To compare the two points, we need to look at their values on a standard temperature scale. Let's use the two most common scales: Celsius and Fahrenheit.

*   **On the Celsius (°C) scale:**
    *   The freezing point of water is **0°C**.
    *   The boiling point of water is **100°C**.

*   **On the Fahrenheit (°F) scale:**
    *   The freezing point of water is **32°F**.
    *   The boiling point of water is **212°F**.

**Step 4: Compare the Numerical Values**
Now, we compare the values for boiling and freezing on each scale.

*   **Celsius Comparison:** Is 100°C higher than 0°C? Yes, 100 is a greater number than 0.
*   **Fahrenheit Comparison:** Is 212°F higher than 32°F? Yes, 212 is a greater number than 32.

Both scales show that the temperature required to boil water is significantly higher than the temperature at which it freezes.

### Final Answer

**Yes.**
