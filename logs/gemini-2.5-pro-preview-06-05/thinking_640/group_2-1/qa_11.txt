*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants a direct answer, and a detailed explanation – essentially, a well-reasoned argument. Let me break this down.

First things first: the core of the query is a comparison – is the Pacific bigger than the Atlantic? Right, got it. I know the answer, of course, but I need to deliver it *correctly*. The user specifically asked for a step-by-step breakdown and a definitive "yes" or "no" answer. That means I need to structure this carefully. 

I need a robust outline. I'll start with the conclusion, the simple "Yes" or "No". That gets straight to the point and meets the user's needs immediately. Then, the meat of it: I'll detail the *how* and the *why*.

Now, thinking about "larger"... that's the key word, isn’t it? It implies a comparison of size, and size can be defined in a few ways. Area, volume, maybe even average depth. I should address area first; that’s the most intuitive measure when we think about oceans. But to really impress this user, I should incorporate volume as well, demonstrating a deeper understanding.

So, how do I build this explanation? Step one: I have to precisely define the metric. Then, I'll have to find the necessary numbers to back up my claim. To do that, I'll start by searching my mental database for the area of the Pacific Ocean, and then... let's get to work on the specifics, to ensure a comprehensive response.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Define the Metric for "Larger"**

To determine if one ocean is "larger" than another, we need to compare them using clear, measurable metrics. The two most common and important metrics for the size of an ocean are:
1.  **Surface Area:** The total amount of the Earth's surface the ocean covers.
2.  **Water Volume:** The total amount of water the ocean contains.

**Step 2: Gather the Data for the Pacific Ocean**

Let's find the accepted measurements for the Pacific Ocean.
*   **Surface Area:** The Pacific Ocean covers approximately **165.25 million square kilometers (63.8 million square miles)**. This makes it the largest single geographic feature on our planet, covering about 30% of the Earth's surface and nearly half of its water surface.
*   **Water Volume:** The Pacific Ocean contains about **710 million cubic kilometers (171 million cubic miles)** of water.

**Step 3: Gather the Data for the Atlantic Ocean**

Now, let's find the same measurements for the Atlantic Ocean.
*   **Surface Area:** The Atlantic Ocean covers approximately **106.46 million square kilometers (41.1 million square miles)**.
*   **Water Volume:** The Atlantic Ocean contains about **310 million cubic kilometers (74 million cubic miles)** of water.

**Step 4: Compare the Data**

Now we compare the figures side-by-side.

*   **Surface Area Comparison:**
    *   Pacific: ~165.25 million km²
    *   Atlantic: ~106.46 million km²
    *   **Conclusion:** The Pacific Ocean's surface area is significantly larger than the Atlantic's.

*   **Water Volume Comparison:**
    *   Pacific: ~710 million km³
    *   Atlantic: ~310 million km³
    *   **Conclusion:** The Pacific Ocean's volume is more than double the Atlantic's.

**Step 5: Formulate the Final Answer**

Based on the direct comparison of both key metrics (surface area and water volume), the Pacific Ocean is substantially larger than the Atlantic Ocean.

### Final Answer

**Yes.**
