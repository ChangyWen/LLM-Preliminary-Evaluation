*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this, thinking it through like a seasoned pro. First, the request itself: the user wants a direct answer, and a clear breakdown of the thought process. Alright, easy enough. Let's dissect it.

First, I need to establish my fundamental understanding. The core question is a straightforward comparison: is Oxygen's atomic number larger than Carbon's?  Okay, I'm going to have to pull that from memory, or the very least, I know where to find it. 

My initial reflex? Atomic number is *the* defining characteristic of an element, the count of protons. It's the 'Z' value. I can't mess that up. Then I'll need to visualize the periodic table. Wait...Carbon... group 14... It's a building block of everything I know about organic chemistry, so I know it sits near the beginning of period 2. I think it's 6, but let me just run through the initial elements in that row... Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Beryllium, Boron, *Carbon!*  Six!  Got it.

Now Oxygen. Next to carbon. Carbon (6), Nitrogen (7), *Oxygen!* (8). Right.

Now, the comparison. Oxygen (8) versus Carbon (6).  8 > 6. The answer is clear. Oxygen's atomic number is higher.

Finally, I'll structure these mental leaps into a coherent, logical series of steps, exactly as the user wants.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning process and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Define Atomic Number:** The atomic number (symbolized as 'Z') of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element. It is the unique identifier for an element.

2.  **Identify the Atomic Number of Carbon (C):** We locate Carbon on the Periodic Table of Elements. Its atomic number is the integer displayed prominently in its box, which is **6**. This means every carbon atom has 6 protons in its nucleus.

3.  **Identify the Atomic Number of Oxygen (O):** We locate Oxygen on the Periodic Table. Its atomic number is **8**. This means every oxygen atom has 8 protons in its nucleus.

4.  **Compare the Atomic Numbers:** We now compare the two values:
    *   Atomic Number of Carbon = 6
    *   Atomic Number of Oxygen = 8

    The number 8 is greater than the number 6.

5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the atomic number of oxygen is higher than the atomic number of carbon.

### Final Answer

Yes.
