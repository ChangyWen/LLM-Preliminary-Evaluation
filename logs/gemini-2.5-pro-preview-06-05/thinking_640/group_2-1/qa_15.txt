*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's get this done. Here's what I'm thinking: the user wants a comparison, a clear explanation of the speeds of light and sound, and the answer in plain terms.

First, let's break down the request. The core question is about the speed comparison - is light faster than sound? The answer has to be crystal clear, and the explanation needs to be step-by-step. Fine.

Next, let's load up on the relevant information. Light, that's electromagnetic radiation, practically instantaneous. We're talking photons, `c`, about 300 million meters per second. It travels through a vacuum, like the vastness of space. Examples? Sun, lasers, the blinding flash of a lightning strike.

Then, we have sound. A mechanical wave. Requires a medium – air, water, anything with particles to vibrate. Doesn't travel in a vacuum, so out in space, no sound. Speed in air is roughly 343 m/s, so it's far slower. And the speed of sound depends on the properties of the medium – temperature, density, all that. Examples? Thunder, everyday speech, music.

The key is the *comparison*. Light's the speed king, absolutely dominant. A perfect real-world example? Lightning and thunder! You see the flash immediately, then hear the delayed rumble. It’s a slam dunk demonstration of the vast difference.

Finally, let's structure this. I'll start with the answer upfront, so the user knows where we're going. I'll make it a concise, confident statement. Then, the heart of the response, the step-by-step breakdown. Gotta be logical, easy to follow, making sure each point builds on the previous one, and clearly leading to the answer. Alright, time to lay it all out.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Define the Speed of Sound**

*   **What is sound?** Sound is a mechanical wave, which means it needs a medium (like air, water, or a solid) to travel. It works by causing vibrations in the particles of that medium.
*   **How fast is it?** The speed of sound depends on the medium it's traveling through. In the air at sea level and at a temperature of 20°C (68°F), the speed of sound is approximately **343 meters per second** (or about 1,235 km/h; 767 mph).

**Step 2: Define the Speed of Light**

*   **What is light?** Light is an electromagnetic wave. It does not need a medium to travel and can move through the vacuum of space.
*   **How fast is it?** The speed of light in a vacuum, represented by the symbol *c*, is the fastest possible speed in the universe. Its value is **299,792,458 meters per second** (or about 1.08 billion km/h; 671 million mph).

**Step 3: Compare the Values**

*   **Speed of Sound (in air):** ~343 m/s
*   **Speed of Light (in vacuum):** ~299,792,458 m/s

Let's compare these numbers directly:
299,792,458 m/s (light) vs. 343 m/s (sound)

To see how many times faster light is, we can divide the speed of light by the speed of sound:
299,792,458 / 343 ≈ 874,030

This calculation shows that the speed of light is over **870,000 times faster** than the speed of sound in air.

**Step 4: Use a Real-World Example**

A perfect example is a thunderstorm.

1.  A lightning bolt flashes. You **see** the flash almost instantly because the light travels from the bolt to your eyes extremely quickly.
2.  The same event creates a massive sound wave (thunder). This sound wave travels much more slowly through the air.
3.  You **hear** the thunder several seconds after you see the flash. You can even estimate the storm's distance by counting the seconds between the flash and the thunder (every 5 seconds is roughly one mile, or every 3 seconds is roughly one kilometer). This delay is direct proof that light travels much faster than sound.

### Final Answer

**Yes.**
