Okay, here's what's going through my mind as I tackle this geographical comparison.

First, the user's request is crystal clear. They want a simple "Yes" or "No" answer to whether the University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan is west of The Ort Institute. They've laid out the expectation: step-by-step reasoning is key.

I'll break this down meticulously. First, I need to pinpoint the geographical locations of each institution. That's step one – identifying the entities: the University of Wisconsin-Sheboygan, and the Ort Institute. I understand my first task is to locate them on a map and determine their relative position. Then, I'll compare their longitudes to establish the answer to the question.

Okay, let's get started. I need to gather information on each location. The University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan... hmm, that name isn’t ringing a bell. Ah, I recall, it's now the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, Sheboygan Campus. Perfect. The address is 1 University Dr, Sheboygan, WI 53081. I'll need the latitude and longitude for that; I can quickly get that from a mapping service or a knowledge base. Right, approximate coordinates will do. Let's say, around 43.75° North latitude and -87.71° West longitude.

Now, for The Ort Institute, IL. Quick search… "ORT Technical Institute" or "Zarem/Golde ORT Technical Institute" comes up. It's likely in Skokie, Illinois. The address is 5440 W Touhy Ave, Skokie, IL 60077. Time to find the latitude and longitude. Approximately 42.03° North latitude and -87.74° West longitude. I've got the information I need. Time for the comparison!

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the relative locations.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the first location:** University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Its longitude is approximately **87.71° West**.

2.  **Identify the second location:** The Ort Institute (specifically, the Zarem/Golde ORT Technical Institute) is located in Skokie, Illinois. Its longitude is approximately **87.74° West**.

3.  **Compare the longitudes:** To determine if one location is west of another, we compare their longitudes. A location with a *greater* West longitude value is farther west.
    *   Location 1 (Sheboygan): 87.71° W
    *   Location 2 (Skokie): 87.74° W

4.  **Conclusion:** Since 87.74° is a greater value than 87.71°, The Ort Institute in Skokie, IL is located slightly farther west than the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan, WI. Therefore, the University of Wisconsin–Sheboygan is located *east* of The Ort Institute.
