*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let me break this down. The user wants to know if Cattaraugus County, NY is west of Cambria County, PA. Seems straightforward enough.

First things first, I need to understand the core of the question. The core is a spatial relationship: is one county to the west of another?

To solve this, I'll need to deconstruct the query. I need to identify the two entities, Cattaraugus County, NY, and Cambria County, PA. Then, I need to understand the relationship – the "west of" comparison. Finally, I need a clear "yes" or "no" at the end.

Now, the key to this is going to be the longitude of each county. Longitude is the determinant of east-west position; a larger longitude value in terms of West longitude means a more westerly location.  My task is to get the longitude for each.

Let's look up Cattaraugus County, NY. I can quickly search for that, and it appears to be approximately 78.7° West. 

Then, Cambria County, PA. Another quick search reveals its longitude is roughly 78.6° West.

Alright, time for the step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **Identify the locations:** Cattaraugus County, NY, and Cambria County, PA. Done.
2.  **Determine Geographic Coordinates:** I’ve got the longitudes. Cattaraugus County, NY is about 78.7° West. Cambria County, PA, is approximately 78.6° West.
3.  **Compare Longitudes:** Since west longitude is represented by larger numerical values, I need to compare their longitudes, remembering that west longitudes are expressed as positive numerical values. Cattaraugus County, NY (78.7° West) is greater than Cambria County, PA (78.6° West).

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the relative locations of the two counties.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the two locations:** We need to find the geographical positions of Cattaraugus County, New York, and Cambria County, Pennsylvania.

2.  **Determine the longitude of each county:** To understand the east-west relationship between two places, we look at their longitude. Longitude lines run north-south, and a higher West longitude value means a location is farther west.
    *   The approximate longitude for the center of **Cattaraugus County, NY** is **78.7° West**.
    *   The approximate longitude for the center of **Cambria County, PA** is **78.6° West**.

3.  **Compare the longitudes:**
    *   Cattaraugus County's longitude (78.7° W) is a slightly larger number than Cambria County's longitude (78.6° W).
    *   On a map, a larger West longitude value places a location farther to the west.

4.  **Conclusion:** Since 78.7° W is west of 78.6° W, Cattaraugus County, NY is located west of Cambria County, PA.
