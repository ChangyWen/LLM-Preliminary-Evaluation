*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's what I'm thinking. I need to figure out if William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, died later than Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy. Simple "Yes" or "No" answer, but I need to show my work.

First, I need to break down the question to be absolutely sure I know what to do. The two figures, the comparison (death date), and the final output are all pretty straightforward.

Next, I need to find the dates. Let's start with William de Warenne. He's a well-known figure, involved in the Norman Conquest, so finding his death date shouldn't be a problem. I'll run a search to quickly get this information. "William de Warenne 1st Earl of Surrey death date" should do the trick. Okay, the sources I'm checking all agree: he died in **1088**. Specifically, June 24th, in Lewes, from injuries sustained at the Siege of Pevensey.

Now, Agnes of Aquitaine. This is where I'll apply the same technique, a search for her death date: "Agnes of Aquitaine Countess of Savoy death date". The search results are pointing towards **1097**, or "after 1097." The "circa" or "after" is key here, but it means she died sometime around that year.

Now I can easily complete the prompt, but I'll need to show my reasoning!

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine if William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, died later than Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the death date of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey.**
    *   Historical records show that William de Warenne was a Norman nobleman who fought at the Battle of Hastings.
    *   He died from wounds he received during the Siege of Pevensey.
    *   His date of death is recorded as **1088**.

2.  **Identify the death date of Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy.**
    *   Agnes of Aquitaine was the wife of Peter I, Count of Savoy.
    *   Historical records indicate that she died after her husband, who passed away in 1078.
    *   Her date of death is recorded as **c. 1097** (circa 1097).

3.  **Compare the two dates of death.**
    *   William de Warenne's death year: 1088
    *   Agnes of Aquitaine's death year: c. 1097
    *   Comparing the two years, 1088 comes before 1097.

4.  **Conclusion.**
    *   Since William de Warenne died in 1088 and Agnes of Aquitaine died around 1097, William de Warenne died *earlier* than Agnes of Aquitaine.
