*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. Someone wants to know if Hillman Houses in Manhattan is south of Williamsburg *in Manhattan*. Right, so let's break this down. The core question is clear: Is Hillman Houses south of Williamsburg? And the user explicitly restricts the comparison to *within* Manhattan.

First thing, I need to know where these places are exactly. I already have a general idea of Hillman Houses, but let me be sure. Ah yes, Cooperative Village, Lower East Side, Grand Street, near the FDR. Got it. Easy. Now for Williamsburg... wait a second. Williamsburg is in *Brooklyn*, not Manhattan. This is a problem. The user's premise is off, and I can see how it could be confusing.

Now what? Do I just say "No" and call it a day because the question isn't properly formulated? Technically, that's correct, but not particularly helpful. I bet the user *really* wants to know if Hillman Houses is south of Williamsburg, period, without getting bogged down in the borough-specific details. So I'll address the elephant in the room – Williamsburg is in Brooklyn – then answer the *implied* question of relative location, which is what they're probably after. Okay, that's the best way to handle this.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the location of HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan:** Hillman Houses is a housing cooperative located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Its approximate location is around Grand Street and Lewis Street.

2.  **Identify the location of WILLIAMSBURG:** The neighborhood of Williamsburg is located in the borough of **Brooklyn**, not Manhattan. It lies just across the East River from the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

3.  **Address the error in the premise:** The question asks if Hillman Houses, Manhattan is south of Williamsburg, **Manhattan**. Since Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, the question is based on a false premise.

4.  **Compare the actual locations:**
    *   Hillman Houses is on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
    *   Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, directly east of the Lower East Side.
    *   To compare their north-south positions, we can look at a map. The Williamsburg Bridge connects the Lower East Side of Manhattan directly to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Hillman Houses is located just south of the Williamsburg Bridge on the Manhattan side. The main part of the Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn is roughly at the same latitude, extending both north and south of the bridge's landing point.

5.  **Conclusion:** Because Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, we cannot make a direct comparison as requested. However, comparing the two actual locations, Hillman Houses is not south of Williamsburg. They are at a very similar latitude, separated by the East River.

***

### Final Answer

**No.**

The neighborhood of Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Therefore, Hillman Houses in Manhattan cannot be south of a "Williamsburg, Manhattan" because the latter does not exist.
