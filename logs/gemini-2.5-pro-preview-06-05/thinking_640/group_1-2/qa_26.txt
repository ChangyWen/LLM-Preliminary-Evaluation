*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The question is simple enough: is ZIP code 97233 in Oregon west of 98580 in Washington? Straightforward. Let me break this down systematically.

First, I need to identify the problem. It's a spatial relationship question; "west of." Second, I need to dissect the information I have. I have two ZIP codes, along with their associated states: 97233 (OR) and 98580 (WA).

My plan? I'll use my internal knowledge base and quickly develop a plan to solve the problem. Step one: locate the geographic areas associated with those ZIP codes. Next step is to determine how to measure the comparison. This involves checking the location of the states. I will then compare their relative longitudes. Longitude is the key metric for east-west comparisons in this case. Finally, after completing these steps, I will generate a final answer, "Yes" or "No".

Now, time to execute. For 97233 in Oregon, I know that ZIP code is in Portland, specifically covering parts of eastern Portland. Centennial and Hazelwood come to mind. To be precise, I need the longitude. I'll quickly search for "coordinates of 97233," or even just "longitude of Portland, OR" will do the trick. I'd estimate Portland's longitude is around -122.67° W.

Next, for 98580 in Washington, I believe this is in Satsop, Washington. Perfect. I have the locations. Now, I need to compare.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the location of the first ZIP code:** 97233 is a ZIP code for an area in eastern Portland, Oregon.
2.  **Identify the location of the second ZIP code:** 98580 is the ZIP code for Satsop, Washington, which is located in Grays Harbor County.
3.  **Determine the longitude of each location:** To determine if one location is west of another, we need to compare their longitudes.
    *   The approximate longitude of Portland, OR (97233) is **122.6° West**.
    *   The approximate longitude of Satsop, WA (98580) is **123.4° West**.
4.  **Compare the longitudes:** A location with a higher West longitude value is further west. Since 123.4° W is a greater value than 122.6° W, Satsop, WA is located further west than Portland, OR.
5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, 97233, OR is **not** located west of 98580, WA. It is located east of it.

### Final Answer
