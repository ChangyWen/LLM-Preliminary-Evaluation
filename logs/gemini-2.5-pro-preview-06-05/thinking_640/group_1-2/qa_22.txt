*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, let me break this down. The user is asking a straightforward geographic question: is the Dal-Tex Building south of Lake Martin? Okay, that's a simple one.

First things first, let's clarify the locales. We're dealing with the Dal-Tex Building, I know it's in Texas, probably Dallas given its historical significance, and Lake Martin, which I believe is in Alabama.

Now, to answer the question precisely, I need the geographic coordinates, specifically latitude, for both locations. The latitude will tell us how far north or south each location is.

Let's start with the Dal-Tex Building. I remember it's historically significant to the JFK assassination, so it’s probably in Dallas.  A quick search for "Dal-Tex Building Dallas address" gives us 501 Elm St, Dallas, TX 75202.  Next, "Coordinates of 501 Elm St, Dallas, TX" gives us a latitude of roughly 32.78 degrees North. That's a good starting point.

Moving on to Lake Martin. A search for "Lake Martin Alabama location" confirms it’s in east-central Alabama, around Alexander City. Time for "Coordinates of Lake Martin, Alabama".  Given it's a large lake, I'll expect some approximation. A quick look gives me a latitude of about 32.7 degrees North.

Now, the comparison. Latitude is the key metric here. Higher latitude equals further north.  The Dal-Tex Building, at approximately 32.78° N, has a slightly *higher* latitude than Lake Martin, at approximately 32.7° N. Therefore, the Dal-Tex Building is *north* of Lake Martin.  It's a slight difference, but a difference nonetheless.  Answer found!

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the answer:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the first location:** The Dal-Tex Building is located in Dallas, Texas. Its address is 501 Elm Street, Dallas, TX.
2.  **Determine the latitude of the first location:** The approximate latitude for the Dal-Tex Building in Dallas, TX is **32.78° N**.
3.  **Identify the second location:** Lake Martin is a large reservoir located in East Central Alabama.
4.  **Determine the latitude of the second location:** Since Lake Martin is a large body of water, we can use the approximate latitude of its center, which is about **32.7° N**.
5.  **Compare the latitudes:** Latitude measures a location's position north or south of the equator. A higher latitude number in the Northern Hemisphere means the location is farther north.
    *   Dal-Tex Building: 32.78° N
    *   Lake Martin: 32.7° N
6.  **Conclusion:** Since 32.78° is a higher number than 32.7°, the Dal-Tex Building is located slightly **north** of Lake Martin, not south.
