*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's how I'd approach this question about the relative locations of Lake Vico and Pragser Wildsee. First, I break down what the user actually *wants*: a clear answer to the question of whether Vico is west of Pragser Wildsee, plus a justification for the answer. So, I need a logical process.

I start with what I *know*. Lake Vico is that cool volcanic lake in Italy, I believe in the Lazio region, fairly close to Rome. Pragser Wildsee is the stunning alpine lake in the Dolomites – absolutely gorgeous, and definitely in the north, specifically South Tyrol.

Now I need to *reason* it out in steps. First, I'll pin down the locations. I'll start with Lake Vico: Italy, Lazio region, north of Rome. Then, I'll look up its longitude; precision is important here. I'm guessing it's roughly around 42 degrees North, 12 degrees East. A quick check confirms that, close to 12.17° East.

Next, Pragser Wildsee. Italy, South Tyrol, the Dolomites. I'll look up the coordinates for it, knowing it will be further east and north. Right, around 46 degrees North, 12 degrees East again – 12.08° East, actually. Now, time to compare.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the location of Lake Vico (Lago di Vico).**
    *   Lake Vico is a volcanic crater lake located in central Italy.
    *   It is situated in the Lazio region, north of Rome.
    *   Its approximate longitude is **12.17° East**.

2.  **Identify the location of Pragser Wildsee (Lago di Braies).**
    *   Pragser Wildsee is an alpine lake located in northern Italy.
    *   It is situated in the Dolomites mountain range, in the region of South Tyrol (Alto Adige).
    *   Its approximate longitude is **12.08° East**.

3.  **Compare the longitudes.**
    *   To determine if one location is west of another, we compare their longitudes. A location with a smaller longitude is to the west of a location with a larger longitude (in the same hemisphere).
    *   Lake Vico's longitude is ~12.17° E.
    *   Pragser Wildsee's longitude is ~12.08° E.
    *   Since 12.17 is greater than 12.08, Lake Vico is located to the **east** of Pragser Wildsee.

### Final Answer

No.
