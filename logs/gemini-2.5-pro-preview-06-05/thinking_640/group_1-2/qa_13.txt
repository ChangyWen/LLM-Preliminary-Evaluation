*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's break this down. The user's asking a straightforward geographical question: is Newellton, LA, located east of Garnavillo, IA? They want a clear, reasoned answer, a "Yes" or "No," and a step-by-step explanation. Fine, I can do that.

First, let's clarify the task. We're looking at two specific locations and their east-west relationship. We have: Newellton, Louisiana; Garnavillo, Iowa; and the question is whether Newellton is east of Garnavillo. The answer needs to be a concise "Yes" or "No" after a clear explanation.

To tackle this, I know I need the longitude coordinates of each location. That's the key to determining their east-west positions. I can't just *know* the answer, but a quick look-up is all I need.

Alright, let's get the data. I'll use my internal knowledge base (or a quick search if I need to refresh the numbers). First, Newellton, LA. Okay, longitude is approximately 91.24° W. Next, Garnavillo, IA. The longitude there is approximately 91.23° W.

Now for the analysis, the actual reasoning. Step one: what are we trying to achieve? We want to compare the longitudes and see where each location is relative to the other. Step two: a little background. Longitude measures distance east or west of the Prime Meridian, and when we're dealing with locations west of the Prime Meridian, which is most of the US, the longitude is given in degrees West. Step three: the comparison rule. In the Western Hemisphere, the *smaller* the longitude number, the *further east* the location. That's the critical piece.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine if Newellton, LA is located east of Garnavillo, IA.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to determine the east-west relationship between two locations: Newellton, Louisiana, and Garnavillo, Iowa.

2.  **Use Longitude for Comparison:** To determine if one location is east or west of another, we must compare their longitudes. Longitude lines run from the North Pole to the South Pole and measure how far east or west a location is from the Prime Meridian (0° longitude).

3.  **Find the Longitude of Each Location:**
    *   The longitude of **Newellton, LA** is approximately **91.24° West**.
    *   The longitude of **Garnavillo, IA** is approximately **91.23° West**.

4.  **Compare the Longitudes:**
    *   In the Western Hemisphere (where both locations are), a *smaller* longitude number means the location is closer to the Prime Meridian and therefore *east* of a location with a larger longitude number.
    *   Comparing the two values: 91.23° W (Garnavillo) is a smaller number than 91.24° W (Newellton).

5.  **Conclusion:** Since Garnavillo's longitude (91.23° W) is a smaller number than Newellton's longitude (91.24° W), Garnavillo is located slightly east of Newellton. This means Newellton is located west of Garnavillo.
