*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's what I'm thinking. First, I need to understand the core question: Did Alfonso of Molina or Yao Shu come into the world first? The user wants a clear yes or no answer, backed up by the reasoning. No problem.

So, let's break it down. I've got two historical figures: Alfonso of Molina and Yao Shu. I need to find out when each of them was born, compare the dates, write it up in steps, and then say "yes" or "no."

The first step is obvious: Find Alfonso of Molina's birth year. I'll try "Alfonso of Molina birth year" or maybe "Alfonso de Molina nacimiento" if it gets too confusing in English. I'll expect Wikipedia or some solid historical source to pop up, hopefully. Got it: Alfonso of Molina was born in 1202.

Next, I tackle Yao Shu. Again, I'll need the birth year, so "Yao Shu birth year" or I'll go straight to the Chinese "姚樞 出生年份." I anticipate finding this information in Wikipedia, maybe Baidu Baike, or some good academic stuff about the Yuan Dynasty. Let's see... 1203!

Now for the comparison. Alfonso of Molina: 1202. Yao Shu: 1203. Easy. 1202 comes before 1203. Looks like Alfonso of Molina was indeed born earlier. Now I just need to formulate the steps in a clear way and then give that final "Yes" or "No."

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the birth year of Alfonso of Molina.**
    *   Alfonso of Molina, an Infante of Castile and Lord of Molina, was born in the year **1202**.

2.  **Identify the birth year of Yao Shu.**
