*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants to know which song came out first: "Pull Me Under" by Dream Theater or "Jimmy James" by the Beastie Boys. Alright, straight away I recognize both tracks. Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under" is, of course, a prog metal classic from their album *Images and Words*, which I remember hitting big in the early 90s. And "Jimmy James" is a killer cut from the Beastie Boys' *Check Your Head* album, another early 90s release, but a bit earlier, I think?

The real challenge here, and what I need to be specific about, is the *exact* dates of release, which could get a little tricky since the question could refer to album or single releases. So, I need to be thorough. My first thought is to pinpoint the critical dates, and I'm already mentally running through my likely sources – Wikipedia, AllMusic, maybe Discogs for the more detailed information.

So, let's start with Dream Theater. I'd search "Dream Theater Pull Me Under release date" online, and I'm expecting to see links to the song's Wikipedia page, and maybe the *Images and Words* album page. The AllMusic and Discogs pages will probably show up too. From there, the goal is clear: I'll be looking specifically for the album release date, and if they released a single, the single's date too. I’m pretty sure that album *Images and Words* was released in 1992, and "Pull Me Under" was a single, so that's what I will confirm.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine which song was released earlier.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the song and album for Dream Theater.**
    *   The song is "Pull Me Under."
    *   It was released on the album *Images and Words*.

2.  **Find the release date for Dream Theater's album and single.**
    *   The album *Images and Words* was released on **July 7, 1992**.
    *   "Pull Me Under" was released as a promotional single on **August 29, 1992**.

3.  **Identify the song and album for the Beastie Boys.**
    *   The song is "Jimmy James."
    *   It was released on the album *Check Your Head*.

4.  **Find the release date for the Beastie Boys' album and single.**
    *   The album *Check Your Head* was released on **April 21, 1992**.
    *   "Jimmy James" was released as the album's first single in **March 1992**.

5.  **Compare the release dates.**
    *   **Beastie Boys' "Jimmy James" (Single):** March 1992
    *   **Beastie Boys' *Check Your Head* (Album):** April 21, 1992
    *   **Dream Theater's *Images and Words* (Album):** July 7, 1992
    *   **Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under" (Single):** August 29, 1992

The earliest release date for "Jimmy James" is March 1992, while the earliest release date for "Pull Me Under" is July 7, 1992 (as part of its album). Therefore, "Jimmy James" was released before "Pull Me Under."
