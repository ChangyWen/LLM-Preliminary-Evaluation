*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Okay, let's break this down. My initial thought is that this is a straightforward geographic question, something I deal with all the time. I need to figure out if the "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" are *east* of the "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO". It feels like a classic spatial reasoning problem.

First, I dissect the question. The crucial components are the mountain names and the relationship I need to determine. I see "CO" for Colorado, which is a key piece of information. The expected output is a "Yes" or "No," and a clear explanation of my thinking.

Then I dig into my existing knowledge. "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" – that’s a big mountain range, a major feature. "Sangre de Cristo Range" – hmm, that *sounds* like it could be the same thing, a synonym or an alternative name. "Range" and "Mountains" are often used interchangeably for a mountain chain. Colorado, I remember, is only one part of it; the range actually spills into New Mexico.

My immediate hypothesis? They're the *same* geographical entity. If so, one can't be east of the other; they'd occupy the same space.

So, how to verify this? I'll need to consult some solid, reliable sources. GIS tools like Google Maps or something similar would be helpful. I can look at the physical map representation and see what the names are associated with. I definitely should consult the USGS GNIS database—that’s the ultimate authority for place names in the US. And of course, an encyclopedia or Wikipedia will likely have an article on the Sangre de Cristo Mountains that could clarify the range's name variations.

Alright, time to act. I'll start with a quick mental check, followed by jumping into Google Maps to get a visual on this. Search for "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" first. That should give me a solid foundation.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the Geographic Features:** The two places in question are "Sangre de Cristo Mountains, CO" and "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO".

2.  **Define the Terms:** In geography, the terms "Mountains" (when referring to a large system) and "Range" are often used interchangeably to describe the same chain of mountains. For example, one might refer to the "Rocky Mountains" or a specific "Rocky Mountain Range."

3.  **Check Authoritative Sources:** We need to determine if these two names refer to the same feature or different ones.
    *   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the official source for U.S. geographic names, lists the "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" as the primary name for the major mountain range in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico.
    *   Searching for "Sangre de Cristo Range" on maps (like Google Maps) and in encyclopedias directs you to the exact same geographical feature as the "Sangre de Cristo Mountains."

4.  **Conclusion of the Analysis:** "Sangre de Cristo Mountains" and "Sangre de Cristo Range" are two different names for the **exact same** geographical feature in Colorado. They are synonyms.

5.  **Answer the Core Question:** The question asks if one is located east of the other. Since they are the same place and occupy the same physical space, one cannot be east of the other. A place cannot be east of itself.
