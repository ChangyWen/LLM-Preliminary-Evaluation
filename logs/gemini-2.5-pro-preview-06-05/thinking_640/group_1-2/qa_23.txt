*************************************** Thinking ***************************************
Alright, here's how I'd approach this, step-by-step. First, I need to really understand the core question: Is this church in Nevada east of that dam in California? And I need to show my work.

Okay, so the first thing is to break it down. I've got two key locations to pin down: St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church and Pine Flat Dam. The request is very specific in that I must use a step-by-step process to derive the correct answer.

Now, let's use my expertise to navigate this. "St. Mary's in the Mountains" – the "NV" gives it away, it has to be in Nevada, right? And, because it's a somewhat well-known historical church, I'm pretty confident it's in Virginia City. So, I'll run that mental search for the coordinates for Virginia City, Nevada. Let's assume it's roughly 39.31 degrees North, 119.65 degrees West.

Next, Pine Flat Dam in California. I know it's somewhere on the Kings River. It is safe to assume it's east of Fresno, which is a major nearby city. To get really precise, I'll quickly search for Pine Flat Dam's coordinates. Let's say that's around 36.83 degrees North, 119.32 degrees West.

Then it's just a matter of comparing. St. Mary's is at roughly 39.31N, 119.65W. Pine Flat Dam is at roughly 36.83N, 119.32W. So, in this case, a west-east comparison comes down to the longitude. Since 119.65 W is west of 119.32 W, then St. Mary's is west of Pine Flat Dam. Therefore, the church is not east of the dam.

Of course. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the relative locations of the two points.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1.  **Identify the first location:** St. Mary’s in the Mountains Catholic Church is located in Virginia City, Nevada.
2.  **Find the coordinates for the first location:** The approximate geographic coordinates for Virginia City, NV are:
    *   **Longitude: 119.65° W**

3.  **Identify the second location:** Pine Flat Dam is located on the Kings River in Fresno County, California.
4.  **Find the coordinates for the second location:** The approximate geographic coordinates for Pine Flat Dam, CA are:
    *   **Longitude: 119.32° W**

5.  **Compare the longitudes:** To determine if one location is east or west of another, we compare their longitude values.
    *   St. Mary's (Virginia City): **119.65° W**
    *   Pine Flat Dam: **119.32° W**

6.  **Analyze the comparison:** In the Western Hemisphere (indicated by "W"), a *larger* longitude number means the location is farther to the *west*. Since 119.65 is a larger number than 119.32, St. Mary's in the Mountains is located west of Pine Flat Dam. Therefore, it is **not** east of the dam.
